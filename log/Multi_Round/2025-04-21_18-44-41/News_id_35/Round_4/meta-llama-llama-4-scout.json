      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\nNews Content: Apple beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter while matching views on sales. Apple stock rose in extended trading.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's earnings beat expectations, especially driven by services, which is often seen as a more stable revenue stream. However, the decline in iPhone sales may raise concerns about future growth, potentially leading to caution among investors. The initial stock rise in extended trading suggests market optimism, but the mixed signals regarding iPhone performance could temper this sentiment. Thus, while there is a probability of a rise, the decline in iPhone sales means the probability of falling cannot be ruled out.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While they beat earnings targets, a key concern is the decline in iPhone sales, which traditionally drives a large portion of their revenue. However, the growth in services is a positive sign, indicating diversification. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering these and more weight put on the stock price rising in extended trading, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment, iPhone sales declined. This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings outweighed the concerns about declining iPhone sales.  However, the long-term impact of the iPhone sales decline remains uncertain.  Investors will likely scrutinize future quarters to assess whether this is a temporary blip or a concerning trend.  Therefore, while the initial reaction is positive, there's a considerable chance of a correction if the trend continues or if future guidance is weaker. The probability of a rise is higher initially due to the positive earnings beat, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales makes a fall a significant possibility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) beat earnings targets, primarily due to growth in its services segment, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the decline in iPhone sales could be a concern, as it is a major revenue driver for the company. Despite this, the stock rose in extended trading, suggesting that the market is reacting favorably to the earnings beat. The positive reaction in extended trading typically indicates a higher probability of the stock price rising when the market officially opens. The decline in iPhone sales might temper some enthusiasm, but the overall earnings beat is likely to dominate investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported beating earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter, primarily due to a lift in Services, but experienced a decline in iPhone sales. Despite the decline in iPhone sales, the company's ability to beat earnings targets suggests a positive outlook. The stock rose in extended trading, indicating an immediate positive reaction to the earnings report. However, the mixed results (beating earnings but missing on iPhone sales) might lead to varied investor reactions, potentially capping the stock's upside. Considering these factors, there's a likelihood that the stock price will rise due to the positive earnings surprise but might be tempered by concerns over iPhone sales.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter, primarily driven by a lift in its services sector. Although iPhone sales declined, the overall performance was positive enough to prompt a rise in Apple's stock in extended trading. This suggests that investors are focusing on the positive aspects of the report, such as the earnings beat and the growth in services, which could indicate a strong potential for future revenue streams. The decline in iPhone sales, however, introduces some uncertainty. Considering the immediate stock price reaction and the overall positive tone of the earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better than expected earnings but faced a decline in iPhone sales. The fact that they managed to beat the earnings target, especially with an emphasis on their services segment, shows strength in other parts of their business model. Despite iPhone sales declining, the overall picture is one where the company performed well by market expectations, leading to an initial positive reaction in stock performance after hours.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple beat earnings targets, primarily due to growth in its services segment, which is positive for investor sentiment. However, the decline in iPhone sales raises concerns about the company\u2019s long-term growth. Despite this mixed bag of news, the immediate market response was positive, as evidenced by the stock rising in extended trading. Investor focus appears to be on the earnings beat and services growth. Although the decline in iPhone sales introduces uncertainty, the overall earnings performance suggests a higher likelihood of short-term stock price appreciation. Hence, I predict a higher probability of stock price rise compared to decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The previous rounds consistently predict a higher probability of the stock price rising, primarily due to the earnings beat and positive market reaction in extended trading. Although the decline in iPhone sales remains a point of concern, the market seems to be prioritizing the overall earnings and growth in services. The median probability assigned by previous models for stock price rise is around 0.65-0.7. I will slightly increase the probabilities for rise given that is the trend shown in the previous predictions. Also the information provided is just a 'beats earning target' and a 'decline in iphone sales', which is not surprising or particularly negative news for Apple, and the fact that the stock rose in after trading is a positive signal, suggesting that the probability of the stock price rising will be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is mixed, presenting both positive and negative signals. The positive is that Apple beat earnings expectations, driven largely by its Services segment, suggesting a healthy and diversifying business model.  The negative is the decline in iPhone sales, a traditionally major revenue driver. The immediate post-earnings stock rise in extended trading suggests that the market is currently prioritizing the positive earnings beat. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is unclear and could lead to a correction.  The consensus among the previous models leans towards a higher probability of a rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.  While the extended trading increase is bullish, the uncertainty surrounding the iPhone sales trend introduces risk. To account for this, I'm slightly lowering the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous models, while increasing the probability of a fall. This reflects the inherent uncertainty in predicting market reaction based on mixed news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple beat earnings expectations, driven by strong performance in its services segment, which is a high-margin and stable revenue stream. This has already led to a rise in the stock price during extended trading, indicating initial market optimism. However, the decline in iPhone sales, a major revenue driver, introduces uncertainty about future growth. Given the immediate positive reaction and the earnings beat, the market seems to weigh the services growth more heavily than the iPhone sales decline. Additionally, the consensus from previous predictions leans slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a 60-70% probability for a rise. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company beat earnings targets, primarily driven by growth in its services segment, which is a positive signal indicating diversification and stability in revenue streams. However, the decline in iPhone sales, a major revenue driver, could raise concerns about future growth. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests that the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the decline in iPhone sales introduces uncertainty that prevents a more extreme prediction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter, primarily driven by a lift in its services sector, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the decline in iPhone sales could be a concern, as it is a major revenue driver for the company. The immediate stock price reaction, with Apple's stock rising in extended trading, suggests that the market is focusing on the positive aspects of the report, such as the earnings beat and the growth in services. Considering the overall positive tone of the earnings report and the initial positive market reaction, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling. However, the uncertainty surrounding the decline in iPhone sales tempers this optimism, leading to a balanced estimation of probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has beaten earnings expectations, driven primarily by a lift in their services sector, which is often viewed positively as a more stable revenue stream. Despite a decline in iPhone sales, the overall performance met and even exceeded expectations. This positive reception is reflected in the immediate rise in the stock during extended trading. Multiple previous predictions have suggested a higher probability of a stock price rise, largely based on the earnings beat and the market\u2019s initial optimistic reaction. Future movements could still depend on how the iPhone sales decline is addressed and if it continues, but at present, the overall earnings report appears robust.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: Apple's earnings beat indicates positive investor sentiment, particularly due to the growth in its services segment, which is often viewed as a stable revenue source. However, the decline in iPhone sales raises concerns about future growth since iPhones are a significant revenue driver for the company. The initial positive response in extended trading suggests that the market is currently prioritizing the earnings beat and service growth over the iPhone sales decline. Therefore, while there is optimism about rising stock prices driven by the earnings outperformance, the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales tempers this enthusiasm. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise but acknowledge a substantial chance of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's earnings beat, driven by service growth, is a strong positive signal. The decline in iPhone sales, while a concern, is already factored into the previous predictions and the market's initial positive reaction in extended trading suggests investors are currently more focused on the earnings beat. The consensus from the previous round leans towards a higher probability (around 0.65 to 0.7) of the stock price rising. Given this trend and the existing information, I will slightly increase the probability of stock price rising as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is mixed, with Apple exceeding earnings expectations due to strong services revenue, but experiencing a decline in iPhone sales.  The post-earnings market reaction (a stock price increase in extended trading) suggests initial optimism outweighing concerns about iPhone sales. However, the long-term impact of the iPhone decline remains uncertain.  The previous rounds of predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (around 0.65-0.7), primarily due to the earnings beat and positive market response. While I acknowledge the positive initial reaction, the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales and its potential future impact warrants caution.  Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downward from a pure 'extended trading' reaction,  reflecting a more balanced perspective considering the mixed nature of the news. The consensus from previous models is given appropriate weight, but I am not solely relying on that information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple beat earnings expectations, driven by strong performance in its services segment, which is a high-margin and stable revenue stream.

However, the decline in iPhone sales, a major revenue driver, introduces uncertainty about future growth. Given the immediate positive reaction and the earnings beat, the market seems to weigh the services growth more heavily than the iPhone sales decline. Additionally, the consensus from previous predictions leans slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a 60-70% probability for a rise. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) beat earnings targets, primarily driven by growth in its services segment. However, iPhone sales declined, which could raise concerns about future growth. Despite this mixed bag of news, the stock rose in extended trading, suggesting that the market is focusing on the earnings beat and services growth. The consensus from previous predictions leans slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a 60-70% probability for a rise. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the decline in iPhone sales introduces uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news that Apple Inc. (AAPL) beat earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter, primarily driven by a lift in its services sector, but experienced a decline in iPhone sales. The immediate market reaction was positive, with Apple's stock rising in extended trading. Considering the mixed signals from the earnings report, with a positive beat on earnings but a decline in iPhone sales, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling. This estimation is also influenced by the trend of previous predictions, which consistently indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price rising due to the positive earnings surprise and the growth in services. However, the uncertainty surrounding the decline in iPhone sales tempers this optimism, leading to a balanced estimation of probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple beat earnings expectations due to growth in its services segment, which is a positive indicator for investor sentiment. However, the decline in iPhone sales raises concerns over future revenue growth since iPhones are a significant driver of income for Apple. Despite the mixed signals, the stock rose in extended trading, indicating initial market optimism that focuses on the earnings beat and services growth. Previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of stock prices rising, typically falling between 0.65 to 0.75. Considering the overall earnings performance and market reaction, I estimate a probability of 0.7 for stock price rise, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales that tempers bullish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The continuous earnings beat from Apple, primarily driven by service revenues, is a consistently positive signal across all rounds. While the iPhone sales decline is acknowledged as a potential concern, the market's immediate positive reaction in extended trading, and the trend in previous predictions indicating a higher probability of a rise, suggest that investors are currently prioritizing the earnings outperformance. Given the consistent nature of the positive earnings beats and the trend across multiple rounds from different advanced models, which lean towards a rise, I am marginally increasing the probability of the stock price rising. I am still taking into account the impact of the iPhone sale decline and thus slightly lower than the high of the range for the rise probability. All models are taking a weighted average between the positive (earnings beat) and negative (iPhone decline) signals. This mixed result still leads, on aggregate, towards predicting a price increase. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's earnings beat, driven by strong services revenue, is a positive signal indicating a healthy and diversifying business model.  However, the decline in iPhone sales, a traditionally major revenue driver, introduces uncertainty. The immediate positive market reaction (stock price increase in extended trading) suggests initial investor optimism outweighing concerns about iPhone sales. Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, mostly ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. This consensus reflects the impact of the earnings beat and the positive market response.  While the extended trading increase is bullish, the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales and its potential future impact warrants a cautious approach, preventing an overly optimistic prediction.  I'm therefore assigning a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the positive earnings beat and market reaction, but acknowledging the risk associated with declining iPhone sales.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by growth in its services segment, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the decline in iPhone sales, a major revenue driver, introduces uncertainty about future growth. The immediate market reaction was positive, with the stock rising in extended trading, suggesting that investors are currently focusing more on the earnings beat and services growth. Previous predictions consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a 60-70% probability for a rise. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but the decline in iPhone sales tempers this optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.
