(AAPL) reported beating earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter, primarily due to a lift in Services, but experienced a decline in iPhone sales. Despite the decline in iPhone sales, the company's ability to beat earnings targets suggests a positive outlook. The stock rose in extended trading, indicating an immediate positive reaction to the earnings report. However, the mixed results (beating earnings but missing on iPhone sales) might lead to varied investor reactions, potentially capping the stock's upside. Considering these factors, there's a likelihood that the stock price will rise due to the positive earnings surprise but might be tempered by concerns over iPhone sales.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
