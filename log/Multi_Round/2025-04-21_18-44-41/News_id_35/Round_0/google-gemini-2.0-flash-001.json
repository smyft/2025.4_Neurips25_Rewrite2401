While they beat earnings targets, a key concern is the decline in iPhone sales, which traditionally drives a large portion of their revenue. However, the growth in services is a positive sign, indicating diversification. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering these and more weight put on the stock price rising in extended trading, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
