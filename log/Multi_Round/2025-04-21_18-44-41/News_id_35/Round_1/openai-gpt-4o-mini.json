(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\nNews Content: Apple beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter while matching views on sales. Apple stock rose in extended trading.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's earnings beat expectations, especially driven by services, which is often seen as a more stable revenue stream. However, the decline in iPhone sales may raise concerns about future growth, potentially leading to caution among investors. The initial stock rise in extended trading suggests market optimism, but the mixed signals regarding iPhone performance could temper this sentiment. Thus, while there is a probability of a rise, the decline in iPhone sales means the probability of falling cannot be ruled out.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While they beat earnings targets, a key concern is the decline in iPhone sales, which traditionally drives a large portion of their revenue. However, the growth in services is a positive sign, indicating diversification. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering these and more weight put on the stock price rising in extended trading, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment, iPhone sales declined. This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings outweighed the concerns about declining iPhone sales.  However, the long-term impact of the iPhone sales decline remains uncertain.  Investors will likely scrutinize future quarters to assess whether this is a temporary blip or a concerning trend.  Therefore, while the initial reaction is positive, there's a considerable chance of a correction if the trend continues or if future guidance is weaker. The probability of a rise is higher initially due to the positive earnings beat, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales makes a fall a significant possibility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) beat earnings targets, primarily due to growth in its services segment, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the decline in iPhone sales could be a concern, as it is a major revenue driver for the company. Despite this, the stock rose in extended trading, suggesting that the market is reacting favorably to the earnings beat. The positive reaction in extended trading typically indicates a higher probability of the stock price rising when the market officially opens. The decline in iPhone sales might temper some enthusiasm, but the overall earnings beat is likely to dominate investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported beating earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter, primarily due to a lift in Services, but experienced a decline in iPhone sales. Despite the decline in iPhone sales, the company's ability to beat earnings targets suggests a positive outlook. The stock rose in extended trading, indicating an immediate positive reaction to the earnings report. However, the mixed results (beating earnings but missing on iPhone sales) might lead to varied investor reactions, potentially capping the stock's upside. Considering these factors, there's a likelihood that the stock price will rise due to the positive earnings surprise but might be tempered by concerns over iPhone sales.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter, primarily driven by a lift in its services sector. Although iPhone sales declined, the overall performance was positive enough to prompt a rise in Apple's stock in extended trading. This suggests that investors are focusing on the positive aspects of the report, such as the earnings beat and the growth in services, which could indicate a strong potential for future revenue streams. The decline in iPhone sales, however, introduces some uncertainty. Considering the immediate stock price reaction and the overall positive tone of the earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better than expected earnings but faced a decline in iPhone sales. The fact that they managed to beat the earnings target, especially with an emphasis on their services segment, shows strength in other parts of their business model. Despite iPhone sales declining, the overall picture is one where the company performed well by market expectations, leading to an initial positive reaction in stock performance after hours.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
