(AAPL)\nNews Headline: AI Fueling Apple iPhone Sales But Limited Rollout Has Hurt\nNews Content: Apple iPhone sales rose in those markets where the company rolled out artificial intelligence features. The news was positive for Apple stock.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were rolled out, suggesting a positive impact on sales and potentially on stock performance. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' implies that the growth may not be widespread, which could temper the overall positive sentiment. Given the positive sales news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the limited rollout introduces some uncertainty, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive impact on iPhone sales due to AI features, which is generally favorable for Apple's stock. However, the 'limited rollout' suggests that the positive impact is not as broad as it could be, potentially tempering the enthusiasm. Considering the positive sales impact but also the limiting factor of the rollout, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The market's reaction will also depend on the extent of the 'limited rollout' and investor expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is positive overall, showing that AI features are boosting iPhone sales in the markets where they've been implemented.  However, the caveat that the rollout has been limited suggests that the positive impact is currently constrained.  This means the positive impact on the stock price might be muted. While the news is generally good, the limited rollout introduces uncertainty.  Therefore, a rise is more likely, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were rolled out, which is a positive signal for the company's performance. However, the limited rollout of these features has reportedly hurt overall performance, which could temper investor enthusiasm. On balance, the positive impact from increased sales in certain markets is likely to outweigh the negative impact from the limited rollout, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that AI features are fueling Apple iPhone sales, which is a positive factor for the company's stock. However, it also mentions a limited rollout that has hurt sales, presenting a mixed scenario. Overall, the positive impact of AI on sales seems to outweigh the negative impact of the limited rollout, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive development for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features may have hindered sales in other markets. Given the overall positive impact of AI on iPhone sales, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to this news, but the limited rollout may temper the increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were introduced, which is seen as a positive factor for the company. This suggests that the introduction of AI technology in their products has positively impacted consumer interest and purchasing behavior, likely leading to better than expected sales. Given the positive nature of the news, it is reasonable to anticipate an increase in investor confidence, potentially driving the stock price upwards.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were rolled out, which is a positive signal for the company's performance. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' suggests that the positive impact may not be as widespread, potentially tempering investor enthusiasm.

While the 'limited rollout' is a concern, the overall consensus is that the positive sales data outweighs this negative aspect. The trend of increasing probability of stock price rise across previous rounds further reinforces this view. Therefore, I will slightly increase the probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news is positive, showing AI features boost iPhone sales where implemented. However, the limited rollout is a significant caveat, suggesting the positive impact is currently constrained.

However, the limited rollout of these features has reportedly hurt overall performance, which could temper investor enthusiasm. On balance, the positive impact from increased sales in certain markets is likely to outweigh the negative impact from the limited rollout, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the cautious tone due to the limited rollout, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive impact on Apple iPhone sales due to the rollout of AI features in certain markets. However, the limited nature of this rollout introduces some uncertainty. Considering the overall positive sentiment from the sales increase and weighing it against the limiting factor of the rollout, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. The consistency in predictions from other models, with a general consensus towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, supports this estimation. The range of predictions from other models, from 0.6 to 0.75 for a rise, suggests a cautious optimism. Given the positive news but also considering the potential tempering effect of the limited rollout, I position my estimate within this range, slightly above the median to reflect the overall positive impact of AI on sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple's iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were rolled out. This is a strong positive indicator and aligns with the general market sentiment towards technological advancements in smartphones.
