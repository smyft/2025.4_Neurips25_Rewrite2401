(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is part of a group of companies expected to report earnings soon, but it highlights that Apple has been lagging behind its peers and has faced persistent concerns regarding its performance in China and its AI strategy. Analysts are projecting a potential guidance cut, which adds to the bearish sentiment. While some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, the overall outlook appears cautious. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall seems higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall earnings season data is positive, Apple is specifically highlighted as a laggard within the Magnificent 7, having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Analysts are projecting potentially lowered guidance. However, the article also mentions that some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate an AI partnership announcement soon, potentially with Baidu. The conflicting information makes it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high certainty. The negative sentiment and potential guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall, but the potential AI partnership provides some upside potential. Given the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece highlights mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings announcement.  While the overall Q4 earnings season is showing strong results, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships in the Chinese AI market as a positive catalyst. The uncertainty surrounding these conflicting viewpoints makes it difficult to definitively predict price movement.  The probability of a price rise is slightly lower due to the negative factors mentioned, but the potential for a positive surprise from a strong earnings report or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a fall from being significantly higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as a laggard among the Magnificent 7, with its stock losing 15% of its value since Christmas due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Estimates for Apple's fiscal year 2025 EPS have been downgraded, indicating bearish sentiment. However, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner soon, which could mitigate some concerns. Given the mixed signals\u2014negative sentiment and potential for positive AI news\u2014the stock price movement is uncertain but leans slightly negative due to the prevailing bearish outlook and earnings estimate cuts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect a local AI partner announcement soon. Given the mixed sentiments and the current struggles, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to ongoing concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. The article mentions that Apple's shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. It also notes that some analysts are projecting a guidance cut, which could negatively impact the stock price. However, Apple bulls believe that the issues are manageable and that the company may announce a local AI partner, which could positively impact the stock price. Given these mixed sentiments, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is uncertain.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the impact of China on its market. On the other hand, there are potential positives such as the possibility of an AI partnership. The recent dip in stock price could make investors more cautious, but it also presents an opportunity for bullish sentiment if the earnings report beats expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it prepares for its upcoming earnings report. While the overall earnings season shows positive trends, Apple is specifically noted as a laggard among its peers, having lost 15% of its value recently due to concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy. Analysts are projecting potential guidance cuts, which adds to the bearish sentiment. However, some bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate a potential AI partnership announcement, which could provide some upside. Given the prevailing bearish outlook and the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about Apple's performance in China, its AI strategy, and potential guidance cuts. However, the possibility of a positive surprise in earnings or an announcement of an AI partnership provides some upside potential. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the mixed signals in the news, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more pessimistic outlook, but not drastically, as the bulls' perspective and potential positive catalysts still hold some weight.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall Q4 earnings season is positive, Apple is lagging, with concerns about China and its AI strategy.  Analyst projections of a guidance cut add to the bearish sentiment. However, the potential for a positive surprise from a strong earnings report or an AI partnership announcement (potentially with Baidu) offers some upside.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65.  Considering the recent negative trend, the potential guidance cut, and the overall cautious sentiment, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the potential for a positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple has been lagging behind its peers in the Magnificent 7, with a 15% drop in stock price since its 52-week high due to concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy. Analysts have also revised downward the EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025, indicating bearish sentiment. On the positive side, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate a potential AI partnership announcement, which could serve as a positive catalyst. Given the prevailing bearish sentiment and recent stock performance, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise. However, the potential for positive surprises from earnings or an AI partnership keeps the probability of a rise from being significantly lower.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting both positive and negative factors.

However, some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect a potential AI partnership announcement soon.

Considering the previous predictions from various models, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the overall earnings season data and the potential for a positive surprise from a strong earnings report or AI partnership announcement, I estimate the probabilities as follows.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy.

The recent stock price drop adds to the prevailing bearish sentiment, but it also creates potential for a positive rebound if the earnings report or upcoming announcements are well-received. The overall sentiment remains cautious.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Concerns about China, AI strategy, and potential guidance cuts weigh heavily, contributing to a recent 15% stock decline. While some analysts are bearish, others see the negativity as overblown and anticipate a positive catalyst in the form of an AI partnership. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the prevailing negative sentiment.
