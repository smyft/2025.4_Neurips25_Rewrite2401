Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\nNews Content: Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nApple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion. \r\n\r\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base has been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL\u2019s Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo\u2019s growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies\u2019 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple\u2019s market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.5%.\n\nApple Stock\u2019s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 27.54X.\n\nPrice/Earnings (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul. \r\n\r\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the company expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and has a strong Services segment, concerns about declining iPhone sales due to competition in China and a stretched valuation weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positives include expected revenue and EPS growth, strong Services growth, and Mac sales growth. The introduction of Apple Intelligence is a long-term positive. However, iPhone sales are expected to decline due to competition in China, and the delayed launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base is a concern. The stock is also considered overvalued. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a significant negative signal. Considering these factors, the negative aspects outweigh the positives in the short term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to show strong growth, and Mac sales are projected to rise, iPhone sales are likely to decline, a significant concern given its contribution to overall revenue.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong bearish signal.  The article highlights concerns about competition in China, a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation. Although the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives. The consensus EPS estimate shows a modest increase, but this is not enough to offset the other negative factors. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s upcoming Q1 earnings report presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple has a consistent track record of beating EPS estimates, with an average surprise of 5.05% over the past four quarters. The Services segment is expected to show steady growth (13.2% YoY), and Mac sales are projected to increase significantly (17.3% YoY). Additionally, Apple's focus on AI with Apple Intelligence could improve its competitive position in the long term. However, there are significant headwinds: iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to decline slightly (0.7% YoY) due to competition in China and delayed AI features. The stock is also considered overvalued (P/E of 28.97X vs. sector's 27.54X) and has underperformed the sector (16.2% return vs. 27.5%). Given these factors, the market may react cautiously to the earnings report, with a slight tilt toward negativity due to the iPhone weakness and valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's stock price movement is uncertain ahead of its Q1 earnings report. The company's expected revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits and an estimated 8.26% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $2.36 could potentially lead to a positive stock reaction if the results beat expectations. However, iPhone sales are predicted to decline by 0.7% year-over-year, and a stretched valuation could negatively impact the stock. Additionally, Apple's AI push and the introduction of Apple Intelligence could improve its competitive position but might not be enough to offset the concerns around iPhone sales and China market competition. Given these mixed factors, the stock's performance is likely to be influenced by its ability to meet or exceed revenue and EPS expectations, as well as the guidance provided for the upcoming quarter and year.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report, with expectations of low to mid-single digit revenue growth. While iPhone sales are expected to decline due to stiff competition in China, the Services segment is expected to show steady growth. The Mac sales are also expected to rise year over year. However, the stock's valuation is considered stretched, with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 28.97X, higher than the sector's average. Additionally, Apple's near-term results are expected to be impacted by the weakness in China and a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple's stock performance. While the company is expected to meet revenue and earnings expectations, there are concerns around iPhone sales, which could impact investor sentiment. The AI push shows potential for future growth but is currently delayed, adding uncertainty. The valuation is also considered high, which might limit upside potential.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
