A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 4% year-over-year and beat consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS. However, there were notable revenue declines in key areas such as Greater China and Wearables, which may dampen overall investor sentiment. Despite the overall positive earnings surprises, the stock has underperformed relative to the S&P 500, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting caution. The mixed results may lead to uncertainty among investors, contributing to a higher probability of price decrease in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While revenue and EPS beat estimates, and several product categories (Mac, iPad) and geographic regions (Europe, Japan) showed strong growth and exceeded expectations, the Greater China region experienced a significant decline. iPhone revenue was slightly below expectations, and Wearables, Home and Accessories also missed estimates. Overall revenue and EPS surprises were relatively small. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the past month suggest negative sentiment toward the stock. Considering these factors, a slight dip is more likely than significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings showed a mixed bag. While the company beat EPS estimates and slightly exceeded revenue expectations,  key geographic segments presented a complex picture.  Greater China revenue significantly missed estimates, offsetting strong performances in Europe and Japan.  Product sales slightly exceeded estimates, but iPhone sales were essentially flat and Wearables, Home, and Accessories fell short. Services revenue showed robust growth. Overall, the earnings beat was modest, and the geographic revenue breakdown suggests some underlying weaknesses. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further signals potential underperformance. Considering the mixed results and negative Zacks ranking, the probability of a price increase is lower than a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Apple's Q1 earnings report for December 2024. The company reported a slight revenue beat (+0.24% over consensus) and a modest EPS beat (+1.69% over consensus). However, the performance across key metrics was mixed. While Europe, Japan, Americas, Rest of Asia Pacific, Mac, iPad, and Services showed strong growth and beat estimates, Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories underperformed. The iPhone revenue was slightly below estimates and declined year-over-year. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance. Given the mixed results and the negative sentiment from the Zacks Rank, the stock may face downward pressure despite the slight earnings beat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, beating the consensus EPS estimate of $2.36 by 1.69%. While the revenue and EPS slightly exceeded estimates, some key metrics showed mixed results. For instance, Greater China revenue declined by 11.1% year-over-year, while Europe and Japan showed significant growth. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month, underperforming the broader market. Given the mixed results and the current sell rating, the probability of the stock price rising is lower compared to the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings report showed a 4% increase in revenue and a 1.69% EPS surprise, which are positive indicators. However, the company's performance in certain geographic regions and product categories was mixed, with some areas showing significant growth (e.g., Europe, Japan, and Services) and others experiencing declines (e.g., Greater China, Wearables, Home and Accessories). Additionally, the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential underperformance in the near term. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in specific geographic regions such as Greater China. The services segment shows healthy growth but some product segments like wearables and iPhone did not perform as expected. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating), which suggests potential underperformance, these factors point towards cautious investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported Q1 earnings that surpassed revenue and EPS estimates modestly, indicating some financial strength. However, the performance across geographic regions was mixed, with particularly poor results in Greater China and underperformance in product categories like Wearables. While there were strong performances in Europe and Japan, the overall mixed sentiment, combined with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggests that investor confidence may be low. Therefore, despite some positive indicators, the pressures from underperforming areas lead to a higher probability of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of falling, primarily due to mixed results from the earnings report and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). While overall revenue and EPS exceeded expectations, the decline in Greater China revenue is a significant concern. The underperformance of Wearables, Home and Accessories, and iPhone revenue being slightly below estimates adds to the negative sentiment. The strong performance in Europe, Japan, and Services is overshadowed by these weaknesses. Given this mixed bag and the negative Zacks ranking, the downward pressure is likely to outweigh any positive momentum.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings report presents a mixed picture. While revenue and EPS slightly beat expectations, the performance across various segments was uneven.  Positive aspects include strong growth in Europe, Japan, and Services, as well as solid performance in Mac and iPad. Negative factors outweigh the positives, however.  The significant decline in Greater China revenue is concerning, and underperformance in Wearables, Home, and Accessories, coupled with essentially flat iPhone sales, indicate potential underlying weaknesses.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 further suggest negative investor sentiment.  The modest beats in overall revenue and EPS don't seem sufficient to overcome these negative factors.  Considering the preponderance of negative indicators and the consensus of previous models leaning towards a price fall, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report showed a slight revenue and EPS beat, indicating some positive performance. However, the results were mixed across different geographic regions and product lines. Significant declines in Greater China and Wearables, Home and Accessories, paired with flat iPhone sales, suggest underlying weaknesses. The stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further indicate negative sentiment. While the slight earnings beat provides some support, the mixed results and negative indicators point towards a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: Apple Inc.'s Q1 earnings report showed a mixed performance. The company reported a 4% year-over-year revenue increase to $124.3 billion and an EPS of $2.40, beating consensus estimates. However, key metrics revealed declines in Greater China (-11.1% year-over-year) and Wearables, Home and Accessories (-1.7% year-over-year), while Europe, Japan, and Services showed strong growth. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Given the mixed results and negative sentiment indicators, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple, with revenue and EPS beating estimates, but declines in key areas like Greater China and Wearables. The overall earnings surprises were relatively small, and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Considering the mixed results, the modest earnings beat, and the negative sentiment from the Zacks Rank, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in specific geographic regions such as Greater China. The services segment shows healthy growth but some product segments like wearables and iPhone did not perform as expected. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating), which suggests potential underperformance, these factors point towards cautious investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
