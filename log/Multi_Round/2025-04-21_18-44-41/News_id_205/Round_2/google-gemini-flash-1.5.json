(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Top-Stock Crown as Analysts Downgrade on iPhone Risk\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nShares fell 3.2% on Tuesday, closing at its lowest since November amid a rocky start to the year. The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China, which has led to analyst downgrades. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies suggest a bearish outlook, with expectations of continued weak demand for iPhones. The stock has already experienced a notable decline, and the consensus among analysts has shifted towards a more cautious stance. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is high, while the likelihood of a price rise appears low in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Multiple analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of AI-driven upgrade cycle are significant concerns. The stock has already experienced a substantial decline in January. The downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, along with MoffettNathanson earlier in the month, indicate a growing consensus of negative sentiment. The fact that Apple lost its top-stock crown to Nvidia further reinforces the negative outlook. The upcoming earnings report next week adds further uncertainty, with analysts suggesting a potential disappointment. The shift of Morgan Stanley's top pick from Apple to Seagate Technology is another bearish signal. While a small percentage of analysts still have a buy rating, the overall trend is downward, and the consensus recommendation is at its lowest since May. Given all these factors, the probability of a further stock price decline is significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  Analyst downgrades from Jefferies (to underperform) and Loop Capital (to hold) further amplify negative sentiment.  The cited 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter and the belief that AI won't boost sales significantly in the near term paint a bleak picture for the short-term outlook.  While 63% of analysts still have a buy rating, the recent downgrades and the consensus recommendation dropping to its lowest since May suggest a shift in sentiment. The significant drop in market capitalization and the fact that Apple is now valued below Nvidia further supports the negative outlook.  The upcoming earnings report next week will be crucial, but the current information points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns about Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of AI-driven growth catalysts. Analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies have downgraded the stock, citing weaker-than-expected sales and a pessimistic outlook for the next few quarters. The stock has already declined significantly in January, and the downgrades suggest further downside risk. Given the negative sentiment, weak sales data, and lack of near-term catalysts, the probability of a further decline is higher than a rebound in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its top-stock crown due to analyst downgrades on iPhone risk. The content highlights that two analyst firms, Loop Capital and Jefferies, downgraded Apple's stock to 'hold' and 'underperform', respectively, citing concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of impact from artificial intelligence on sales. The stock price fell 3.2% on the day, and Apple's market capitalization dropped by over $110 billion, causing it to fall below Nvidia Corp. in size. Given the negative sentiment from analysts and the significant drop in stock price, it is likely that the stock price will continue to face downward pressure. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. has received analyst downgrades due to concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in the China market. The downgrades, combined with the company's recent stock performance, suggest a negative outlook for the stock. The article mentions that Apple's stock has fallen 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Additionally, the company's market capitalization has dropped, and it has lost its top-stock crown to Nvidia Corp. The analyst downgrades and negative sales trends indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. This negative sentiment from analysts combined with current weak performance indicators suggests continued downward pressure on the stock price. Moreover, the stock is already experiencing significant declines, and the upcoming earnings report may not provide positive surprises.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China, which has led to multiple analyst downgrades.

The stock's recent performance, including a significant drop in January and the loss of its top-stock crown to Nvidia, reinforces this bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings report adds further uncertainty, with analysts suggesting a potential disappointment.

The stock has already experienced a significant drop, losing its top-stock position to Nvidia.  While some analysts maintain a buy rating, the consensus is shifting towards caution, with the recommendation rating at its lowest point since May. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the current information strongly suggests a higher probability of further decline.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, reinforcing this assessment.  While a small chance of a price rise exists due to potential positive surprises in the earnings report or a market-wide rebound, the current negative sentiment and weak fundamentals make a price fall significantly more likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China, leading to analyst downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies.
