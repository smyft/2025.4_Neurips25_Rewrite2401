(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Top-Stock Crown as Analysts Downgrade on iPhone Risk\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nShares fell 3.2% on Tuesday, closing at its lowest since November amid a rocky start to the year. The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.
