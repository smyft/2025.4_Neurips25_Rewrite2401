(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\nNews Content: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is experiencing a significant downturn, with an 11% drop since the start of the year, making it the weakest performer among major tech stocks. The stock is nearing a critical technical support level (200-day moving average), which could lead to further losses if breached. Analysts express concerns about the loss of confidence in the stock's uptrend. Despite some optimism regarding future earnings and growth potential in services and wearables, the overall sentiment is cautious due to the current performance and the upcoming earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. The negative aspects include: a significant year-to-date stock decline (11%), underperformance compared to the S&P 500, approaching a critical support level (200-day moving average), and analysts expressing concern about the stock's uptrend. The positive aspects include: analysts remaining optimistic about Apple's future growth potential in services and wearables, a prediction that Q1 earnings might not disappoint, and news of a \"massive investment\" in the U.S. However, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock's recent performance and the breach of the 200-day moving average are significant concerns. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a major catalyst that could swing the stock price either way. Given the current negative momentum and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, the probability of a further fall is slightly higher than a rise. The market's reaction to the earnings report will be crucial.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's weak start to 2025, its proximity to a critical technical support level (200-day moving average), and analyst concerns about the potential for further losses.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing growth in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment is negative due to the stock's underperformance compared to the broader market and the loss of its top market cap position. The upcoming earnings report is a key catalyst that could significantly impact the stock price.  The overall tone suggests a higher probability of a short-term price decline, although the long-term outlook remains uncertain and dependent on the earnings report and broader market conditions.  The probability estimates are subjective and based on the information provided in the news article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares down 11% YTD and nearing the 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. Analysts express concerns about the stock's uptrend being compromised if this level is breached. However, optimism remains due to upcoming earnings, potential growth in services and wearables, and a recent announcement of a 'massive investment' in the U.S. The stock's recent performance and technical indicators suggest short-term bearish sentiment, but long-term prospects and analyst optimism provide some bullish counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has had a turbulent start to 2025, with its stock plummeting by 11%, making it the weakest performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is approaching a critical level, the 200-day moving average, which is seen as a long-term support level. If breached, it could signal further losses. Analysts are mixed, with some expressing concern over the stock's performance and others remaining optimistic about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 is a key event that investors are closely watching. Given the current technical and fundamental analysis, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has had a turbulent start to the year, with an 11% decline, making it the weakest performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is approaching a critical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further losses if breached. However, analysts remain optimistic about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 is a key event that investors are watching closely. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still significant due to the overall positive outlook from analysts.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the beginning of the year. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical support level, which could potentially trigger further selling if breached. Analysts express concern over the loss of confidence due to the stock flirting with this key level. Despite this, there is optimism from analysts about Apple's future prospects, particularly in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings may provide positive insights.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is facing significant challenges with an 11% decline since the start of the year, making it the weakest performer among major tech stocks.

The stock's significant decline, its proximity to the 200-day moving average, and analyst concerns about a potential breach of this level all point towards a higher probability of further decline. While there's some optimism regarding future growth areas and upcoming earnings, the immediate negative momentum and the overall market uncertainty outweigh these positive factors. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reinforcing this assessment. The fact that the stock has been underperforming the market and that Nvidia has overtaken Apple in market value further supports a negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple in the short term, but with some mitigating factors suggesting a less extreme probability of a fall than some previous predictions.  The stock's 11% decline, proximity to a critical support level (200-day moving average), and analyst concerns about loss of confidence all point towards a higher probability of a price fall.  However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a significant catalyst that could significantly alter the trajectory.  Analysts remain somewhat optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects, citing growth potential in services and wearables.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight leaning towards a fall. Considering the mixed signals and the potential impact of the earnings report, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly upward for a rise compared to some previous predictions, reflecting the possibility of a positive surprise.  The overall sentiment remains cautiously bearish in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant downturn at the start of 2025, with an 11% drop in stock price, making it the weakest performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group.

(AAPL) has started the year on a weak note, with an 11% decline in stock price, making it the worst performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group. The stock is approaching a critical technical support level, the 200-day moving average. Breaching this level could lead to further losses and erode confidence in the stock's uptrend. While analysts remain optimistic about Apple's future growth potential, especially in services and wearables, and predict that the upcoming Q1 earnings might not disappoint, the current technical and fundamental analysis suggests a higher likelihood of a short-term price decline. The mixed signals from analysts and the upcoming earnings report on January 30 introduce uncertainty, but the overall sentiment leans towards caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article reports a significant decline in Apple's stock price, with an 11% drop since the start of the year, making it the weakest performer in the 'Magnificent 7' group.

Analyst sentiment is mixed, with concerns about the stock's uptrend being compromised. While some analysts remain optimistic about future growth areas like services and wearables, the immediate negative momentum and market uncertainty outweigh these positive factors. The upcoming earnings report is a key catalyst, but given the current bearish trend and the consistent predictions of a higher probability of a fall in previous rounds, the likelihood of a further decline remains elevated. The fact that Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market value further reinforces the negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds.  The 11% year-to-date decline, its worst start since 2008, and proximity to the crucial 200-day moving average paint a bearish picture. Analyst concerns about loss of confidence further reinforce this negative sentiment. While there's optimism regarding future growth in services and wearables, and the upcoming earnings report could be a catalyst, the immediate risk of a breach of the 200-day MA and the overall negative momentum outweigh the positive factors.  The consensus from previous prediction rounds also leans heavily towards a price fall.
