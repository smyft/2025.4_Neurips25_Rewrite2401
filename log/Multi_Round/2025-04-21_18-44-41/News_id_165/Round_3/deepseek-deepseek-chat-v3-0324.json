(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust actions. This could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple, potentially boosting investor confidence and stock price. However, the ongoing legal challenges and fines from the EU may still weigh on the stock. Overall, the sentiment appears positive due to the political backing, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Trump's support against EU antitrust actions is a positive, potentially reducing future financial burdens from fines. This could be seen as a bullish signal. However, the article also highlights existing fines and ongoing antitrust scrutiny in both the EU and the US. The US DOJ's antitrust suit against Apple, alleging an illegal monopoly, is a significant negative. The fact that Big Tech CEOs are trying to cozy up to Trump suggests they anticipate continued regulatory pressure, even with his support. The existing fines have already impacted Apple's earnings, as noted in the article. Considering these factors, the positive impact of Trump's support is somewhat offset by the ongoing legal battles and the potential for future regulatory challenges. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether investors focus more on the potential for reduced EU fines or the continued threat of US antitrust action. Given the existing DOJ lawsuit, I believe the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Trump's criticism of the EU's antitrust actions against US tech companies, including Apple's significant fine. While Trump's stance might be seen as positive for Apple in the short term, suggesting a potentially more lenient regulatory environment under a potential second Trump administration, several factors complicate a simple prediction.  The article also mentions ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Apple in the US, which are independent of the EU actions and pose a significant risk.  The EU fines have already negatively impacted Apple's earnings, and the possibility of further fines or regulatory actions remains.  Therefore, while Trump's comments might offer a slight short-term boost to investor sentiment, the overall impact is uncertain due to the ongoing legal battles and the inherent volatility of the market.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the significant existing and potential future legal challenges.  The probabilities are assigned based on a balanced assessment of these opposing forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust fines, suggesting a potential easing of regulatory pressures under his administration. This could be perceived positively by investors, as reduced regulatory risks may lead to improved financial performance and investor confidence. However, the immediate financial impact of the EU fines has already affected Apple's earnings per share, which could weigh on the stock in the short term. The balance between these factors suggests a moderate positive sentiment overall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing antitrust battles between the European Union and American tech giants, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). President Trump's comments suggest a defensive stance towards these companies, implying a potential shift in regulatory environment in their favor. This could be perceived positively by investors, as a more forgiving regulatory environment might lead to increased profitability for these companies. However, the impact is nuanced as the US also has ongoing antitrust suits against these companies. The article also mentions that Big Tech CEOs have been seeking to gain Trump's favor, which could indicate a strategic alignment. Given this context, the stock price of Apple might see a slight increase due to the perceived positive regulatory outlook, but the probabilities are not skewed extremely in either direction due to the complexity and ongoing nature of these regulatory battles.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. Trump's comments and actions suggest a more forgiving regulatory environment for these companies, which could positively impact their stock prices. Additionally, the article mentions that Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, have sought to cozy up to Trump, which could further indicate a favorable regulatory environment. However, the article also notes that the US is battling Big Tech in the courtroom over alleged antitrust violations, which could negatively impact stock prices. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights ongoing tensions between the U.S. and the EU over antitrust issues with American tech giants, particularly Apple. While Trump's defense of these companies provides some reassurance, it does not mitigate the significant fines and regulatory actions already imposed. The recent fine on Apple and ongoing litigation could weigh negatively on investor sentiment, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, Trump's stance might provide some short-term relief.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust actions, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. This political backing may boost investor confidence and positively influence Apple's stock price. However, the ongoing legal challenges and significant fines from the EU, which have already impacted Apple's earnings, create a counterbalancing negative sentiment. The mixed signals from the news suggest that while there is potential for a positive reaction due to Trump's comments, the existing legal pressures and fines weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise, tempered by the risks of ongoing litigation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Trump's support against EU antitrust actions is a positive signal, potentially reducing future financial burdens. However, the article also highlights existing fines and ongoing antitrust scrutiny in both the EU and the US. The US DOJ's antitrust suit against Apple, alleging an illegal monopoly, is a significant negative. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of uncertainty, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to Trump's support, while others predict a fall due to ongoing legal battles. Given the existing DOJ lawsuit and the potential for further regulatory challenges, I believe the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positive, but the effect is not strong. Therefore, I will adjust the probabilities slightly towards a fall, but not drastically.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for Apple's stock. Trump's vocal opposition to EU antitrust actions offers a potential short-term boost, suggesting a less hostile regulatory environment under a potential second Trump term.  This is supported by the actions of Big Tech CEOs seeking to align with Trump. However, this positive sentiment is significantly counterbalanced by several factors.  The substantial EU fines already levied against Apple and their impact on earnings are undeniable negatives.  Furthermore, the ongoing US antitrust lawsuits against Apple pose a significant long-term risk, independent of the EU situation.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty. While Trump's support might offer a temporary reprieve, the weight of existing fines and ongoing legal battles in both the US and EU suggests that the negative factors outweigh the positive in the medium to long term.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, President Trump's defense of American tech giants against EU antitrust actions could signal a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially boosting investor confidence. Additionally, the alignment of Big Tech CEOs with Trump suggests strategic support that might mitigate future regulatory risks. However, the immediate financial impact of the EU fines has already negatively affected Apple's earnings per share, and ongoing antitrust lawsuits in both the EU and the US pose significant risks. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether investors focus more on the potential regulatory relief or the existing legal and financial challenges. Given the balance of these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

On one hand, President Trump's defense of American tech companies against EU antitrust actions could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially boosting investor confidence and stock price.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting this uncertainty.  While Trump's stance might offer a short-term boost, the weight of existing and potential future legal challenges suggests a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation than a significant rise. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight shift towards a higher probability of a price fall in the second round.  Considering all factors, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the significant existing negative factors and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Trump's support.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc.
