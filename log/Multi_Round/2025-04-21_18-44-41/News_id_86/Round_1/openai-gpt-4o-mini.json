(AAPL)\nNews Headline: OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout\nNews Content: OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project.

Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, which positions OpenAI as a key player in the AI sector, particularly in government applications. While the emergence of DeepSeek has caused initial panic in the market, it is suggested that increased competition could lead to greater innovation and spending in the industry. Apple, along with Meta, is seen as potentially benefiting from this shift towards more cost-effective AI models. Given these factors, the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, despite the competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the rise of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model could benefit Apple, as the article suggests that Apple's platform could benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. This is reflected in the fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off prompted by DeepSeek's rise. On the other hand, the news focuses primarily on OpenAI's initiatives (ChatGPT Gov and the Stargate Project) and the competitive landscape in AI, with DeepSeek's emergence posing a challenge to the established players. While Apple is mentioned as potentially benefiting from cheaper AI models, it's not directly involved in the OpenAI initiatives or the Stargate Project as a core partner like Microsoft, Nvidia, or Oracle. Therefore, the positive impact is indirect and less pronounced. Given the overall context, the news is slightly positive for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not by a large margin.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on OpenAI's new ChatGPT Gov and the impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. While OpenAI's government partnership is positive for them, the main focus is on DeepSeek's disruptive potential.  The article highlights that Apple gained ground during the market sell-off caused by DeepSeek's success, suggesting that Apple's existing platforms could benefit from cheaper AI models. This implies that Apple might see increased efficiency and potentially lower costs in developing its own AI initiatives.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic for Apple, as the DeepSeek threat is framed as a potential catalyst for innovation and cost reduction, rather than a direct threat to Apple's core business.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov, which strengthens its partnership with the U.S. government and positions it as a key player in maintaining American tech leadership. This could be seen as a positive development for the broader tech sector, including Apple (AAPL), as it underscores the importance of AI innovation and government collaboration. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off of other AI-related stocks, as investors believe its platform could benefit from more cost-effective AI models. The emergence of DeepSeek introduces competition but also signals potential for industry-wide innovation, which may favor established players like Apple. However, the overall market reaction to AI advancements is mixed, with some volatility expected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Gov for US government agencies and a new $500 billion AI project, the Stargate Project, backed by several tech companies including OpenAI. However, the article also mentions the impact of a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, which caused a market rout for many AI-related stocks, including Nvidia's 17% plummet. Despite the initial panic, some market observers believe heightened competition will lead to further innovation and increased industry spending. Apple (AAPL) was mentioned as one of the companies that gained ground during the sell-off, as investors believe its platforms will benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. Given this context, the news seems to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it implies potential benefits from increased competition and innovation in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT Gov, a tailored version of ChatGPT for US government agencies, and the impact of DeepSeek's breakout on the AI industry. Despite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers believe that heightened competition will increase industry spending and lead to further innovation, benefiting companies like Apple. The article mentions that Apple gained ground during the sell-off, suggesting that investors believe the company's platforms will benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the launch of ChatGPT Gov by OpenAI, aimed at streamlining government access to AI models, which positions OpenAI as a key player in AI technology. The news also mentions the potential benefits of more cost-effective AI models and innovation. While the market reaction to DeepSeek's breakout has caused some panic, the broader perspective suggests that increased competition could drive further innovation and growth. Apple Inc., although not directly involved in the mentioned AI initiatives, may indirectly benefit from a push towards more cost-effective AI solutions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
