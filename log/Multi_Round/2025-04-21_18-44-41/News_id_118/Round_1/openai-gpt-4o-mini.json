(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\nNews Content: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage the potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which could indirectly affect Apple due to its role in the app ecosystem. However, the focus is on Meta and its competitive positioning rather than any direct negative impact on Apple. Given that Apple is a strong company with a solid market position, the news does not suggest any immediate threat to its stock price. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of it falling, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability of rise and a lower probability of fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Meta's attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing Instagram usage, as Instagram is available on the Apple App Store. However, the news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy and doesn't directly impact Apple's core business or revenue streams. The article also mentions potential delays or reversals of the TikTok ban, which would negate any potential benefit to Instagram and, by extension, Apple. Given the indirect and uncertain nature of the impact, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple is relatively low. The current premarket price action of META being down suggests a slightly negative sentiment in the market, which could indirectly affect AAPL as well. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on potential TikTok restrictions. While this might indirectly benefit Instagram and, by extension, Meta, the impact on Apple is tenuous at best.  The article doesn't directly link Apple's stock performance to Meta's strategy.  The news primarily concerns Meta's competitive moves and its financial investments in content creators.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price being significantly affected by this news is low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to leverage the potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, offering cash incentives to creators. While this could strengthen Meta's position in the short-form video market, the news does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The headline mentions Apple only in the context of TikTok's absence from app stores, which is not a new development. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on AAPL's stock price. The broader market sentiment and other company-specific factors would play a more substantial role in AAPL's stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by leveraging the potential ban of TikTok, offering cash deals to creators to post exclusively on Instagram Reels. This move is aimed at gaining an advantage over TikTok, which has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for about 4% of the U.S. digital ad market. However, the news does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is more focused on the social media and advertising strategies of Meta. The potential TikTok ban could indirectly affect Apple if it impacts the overall social media and advertising landscape, but there is no direct correlation mentioned in the news. Given the lack of direct impact on Apple's core business, the stock price movement probabilities remain relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by leveraging the potential ban of TikTok, offering cash deals to creators to shift their content to Instagram Reels. This move is seen as a strategic attempt to gain an advantage in the social media market. However, the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as being significantly impacted by this development. The news is more relevant to Meta (META) and its competition with TikTok. Since the news does not directly affect Apple's financials or operations, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news describes Meta Platforms' strategy to promote Instagram on various social media platforms by leveraging the potential ban threat of TikTok. This move could increase competition for Apple's ecosystem but also provides opportunities for increased content creation and engagement on Instagram, potentially benefiting Apple through higher app usage and potentially more in-app purchases. The stock price of Apple is not directly affected but might experience minor volatility based on broader market reactions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
