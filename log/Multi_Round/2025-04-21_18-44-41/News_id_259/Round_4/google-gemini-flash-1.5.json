      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and its implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. While Apple may not be directly affected by TikTok's operations, the potential for regulatory changes and the impact on user engagement with apps could lead to a cautious sentiment among investors. The possibility of a ban could also affect Apple's app ecosystem, leading to concerns about future revenue from app sales and services. However, the news also suggests potential avenues for resolution, such as Trump's involvement, which could mitigate negative impacts. Overall, the uncertainty leans towards a higher probability of stock price decline due to the immediate regulatory concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. While Apple is mentioned as one of the companies required to remove TikTok from its app store, the direct impact on Apple's revenue and user base is likely to be minimal. The article highlights several possible scenarios, including ByteDance shutting down the app, Trump intervening, or a sale to a US company. The uncertainty surrounding the situation creates a mixed outlook. The negative aspect is the potential removal of an app from the app store, which could be perceived negatively by some investors. However, the potential for Trump to intervene and the possibility of a sale introduce positive possibilities. Given the limited direct impact on Apple's core business and the mixed signals, the stock price is unlikely to experience a significant swing in either direction. The probabilities are therefore relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral to slightly negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok from US app stores on January 19th.  This directly impacts Apple, as it would be legally required to remove TikTok from its App Store. While the article mentions several potential scenarios, including a delay or sale of TikTok, the immediate impact is the potential loss of revenue from TikTok's presence on the App Store.  The uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for legal challenges adds to the risk.  However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be relatively small compared to its vast revenue streams.  The probability of a significant stock price movement solely due to this news is therefore low.  A slight negative impact is more likely due to the uncertainty and potential for negative publicity, but the overall effect is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple. While the ban could reduce competition for Apple's services (e.g., Apple Music, App Store), it may also negatively impact Apple's App Store revenue if TikTok is removed. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly positive, as the removal of TikTok could drive users to Apple's native apps and services. Additionally, the uncertainty around Trump's potential actions and the legal hurdles add complexity, but Apple's diversified business model mitigates significant downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other tech companies has mixed implications for Apple's stock price. On one hand, the ban of TikTok could lead to increased competition for other social media platforms, potentially benefiting Apple. On the other hand, the uncertainty and potential disruption to TikTok's operations could negatively impact Apple's app store business and relationships with developers. However, given that TikTok's ban is related to ByteDance and not directly to Apple's core business, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. The news is more relevant to ByteDance and TikTok than to Apple directly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications on tech giants like Apple. The ban would require Apple to remove TikTok from its app store, but it would not necessarily affect existing users. The article also mentions that President-elect Donald Trump is considering ways to save TikTok, including an executive order to delay enforcement of the ban. Given that Apple's stock price is not directly tied to TikTok's performance, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, if the ban is enforced, it could lead to a slight decrease in Apple's stock price due to potential losses in app store revenue. On the other hand, if Trump's efforts to save TikTok are successful, it could lead to a slight increase in Apple's stock price due to the potential for increased app store revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban introduces uncertainty for Apple, as it is required to remove TikTok from its App Store if the ban is enforced. While the direct impact on Apple's revenue may be limited, the uncertainty surrounding regulatory changes and potential legal challenges could lead to cautious sentiment among investors. The possibility of intervention by President-elect Trump adds a layer of complexity, but the immediate implications lean towards a negative outlook due to the potential loss of app store revenue and the risk of negative publicity. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the US and its potential impact on Apple. While Apple is mentioned as a company that would need to remove TikTok from its app store, the direct financial impact on Apple is likely to be limited. The article presents several possible scenarios, including a shutdown, intervention by Trump, or a sale. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a slight negative impact and others towards a neutral or even slightly positive impact. Considering the uncertainty and the limited direct impact on Apple's core business, I believe the stock price is more likely to remain relatively stable. However, the potential for negative publicity and the removal of an app from the app store could create a slight downward pressure. Given the trend of previous predictions, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban has a relatively low direct impact on Apple's stock price. While Apple would need to remove TikTok from its App Store, the financial impact is likely minimal compared to Apple's overall revenue.  The uncertainty surrounding the situation, including Trump's potential intervention and the possibility of a sale, introduces significant uncertainty.  However, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight negative impact due to the uncertainty and potential loss of App Store revenue, while others see a neutral or even slightly positive impact due to the potential for increased competition for Apple's services. Considering the minimal direct impact and the high level of uncertainty, a significant price movement in either direction is unlikely. The probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of a minor price decrease due to the uncertainty and potential negative press.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is required to remove TikTok from its App Store if the ban is enforced. While this could lead to a minor loss in App Store revenue, Apple's diversified business model and the possibility of Trump intervening to delay or overturn the ban mitigate significant downside risk. Additionally, the removal of TikTok could drive users to Apple's native apps and services, potentially offsetting any negative impact.

The probabilities are balanced with a slight lean towards neutrality.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications on tech giants like Apple has mixed effects on the stock price. On one hand, Apple's direct involvement with TikTok is limited, and the ban may not significantly impact its revenue. On the other hand, the uncertainty and potential disruption to the app store ecosystem could lead to a cautious sentiment among investors. Given that there are possibilities for Trump to intervene and for TikTok to find a buyer or alternative solutions, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, the slight possibility of negative publicity and regulatory challenges affecting the tech sector as a whole could lead to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and its implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market.

The uncertainty surrounding the situation, including the possibility of President-elect Trump's intervention, a sale of TikTok, or ByteDance voluntarily shutting down the app, creates significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the difficulty in assessing the impact.  A significant price movement in either direction is unlikely.  However, the potential for negative publicity surrounding the ban and the uncertainty itself could create a slightly negative sentiment among investors.
