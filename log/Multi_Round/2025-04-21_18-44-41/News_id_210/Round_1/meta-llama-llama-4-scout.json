(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Labour installs Amazon man at CMA as Trump threatens tech war\nNews Content: Doug Gurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022 - Shutterstock\n\nThe chairman of Britain\u2019s competition regulator has been ousted and replaced with a veteran Amazon executive as Donald Trump threatens a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants.\n\nMinisters last night appointed Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022, as interim chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nHe will replace Marcus Bokkerink, who is leaving just three years into a five-year term at the watchdog, after an intervention from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary.\n\nIt is understood his exit is intended to signal that the Government is serious about its efforts to unlock growth, as the CMA has in recent years been attacked for attempting to halt a wide range of deals.\n\nThis includes an effort to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a356bn) takeover of gaming company Activision in 2023, which led to the former\u2019s boss Brad Smith claiming his confidence in the UK had been left \u201cseverely shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, under Mr Gurr, Amazon accused the CMA of a \u201cspeculative\u201d effort to block a minority investment in the UK\u2019s Deliveroo in 2018.\n\nFive years later, Will Shu, Deliveroo chief executive, claimed the watchdog was \u201ctrying to kill companies\u201d.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink, a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, could serve to \u201creassure\u201d the technology sector and say \u201cwe\u2019re taking growth seriously\u201d.\n\nHowever, they also pointed to the fact that Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, has ultimate day-to-day responsibility for the regulator, raising questions over how she will collaborate with Mr Gurr.Sarah Cardell will retain overall responsibility for running the CMA - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nClash with White House\n\nThe unexpected departure of Mr Bokkerink comes as Britain risks a clash with Mr Trump\u2019s new White House regime over its stance on global competition rules.\n\nThe CMA has already announced an investigation into Google over its search dominance this year, while The Telegraph understands it also has been preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores.\n\nMarc Andreessen, who donated to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, last week said there were \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the UK on competition rules, claiming they were \u201cextremely draconian, anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies\u201d.\n\nBrussels regulators have reportedly put major decisions on investigations into Apple, Meta and Google on hold \u2013 in part to assess the temperature of the Trump administration.\n\nCristina Caffarra, a competition economist, said: \u201cIf anyone tried anything that had the potential to make real change, we now know there would be unknown retribution as Trump has indicated he would protect American platforms from Europe, and they bent the knee.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThere were four men [Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai] in the front row [at Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration] worth nearly a trillion dollars, it\u2019s very clear he will protect them in some way.\u201dTech bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration - Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that Labour\u2019s decision to appoint Mr Gurr in the name of growth \u201cseems odd when they are simultaneously appointing their trade union and party donors elsewhere\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as the Government faces calls to refer the attempted takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi fund to the CMA as a breach of legislation banning foreign state ownership of newspapers.\n\nAn investigation of the potential threat to press freedom was paused last year to allow RedBird IMI, which had acquired an option on ownership, to secure an onward sale.\n\nThe process has failed to deliver a transaction, chiefly owing to Abu Dhabi\u2019s price expectations, and RedBird IMI recently urged Telegraph executives to make job cuts and abandon editorial investments prompting a demand for action this week from Sir Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader.\n\nHe accused the Government of \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to upset the UAE.\u201d\n\nA request for the CMA to complete the investigation could allow Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, to order The Telegraph\u2019s independent directors to sell the company at a market price to any acceptable buyer.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink. A government spokesman declined to comment. The CMA was contacted for comment.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a shift in the leadership of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK, with the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, potentially signaling a more business-friendly approach to regulation. This could be seen as positive for tech companies like Apple, as it may reduce the likelihood of stringent regulatory actions against them. However, the mention of a potential trade war initiated by Trump and ongoing investigations into Apple by the CMA introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans towards a favorable outlook for Apple, but the geopolitical tensions could temper that optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the appointment of Doug Gurr, an ex-Amazon executive, to head the CMA suggests a potentially more lenient regulatory environment in the UK, which could be beneficial for large tech companies like Apple facing antitrust scrutiny. The article explicitly mentions a potential second probe into Apple and Google's app store power. A less aggressive CMA could reduce the risk of costly legal battles and restrictions on Apple's business practices. However, the threat of a trade war with the US under a potential Trump administration introduces significant uncertainty. Trump's protectionist stance towards US tech giants could lead to retaliatory measures against companies like Apple if the UK (or EU) pursues aggressive regulatory actions. This uncertainty, coupled with the political implications of the CMA appointment (criticism from the shadow business secretary), creates a complex situation. Given the potential for both positive (less UK regulation) and negative (US trade war) outcomes, the impact on Apple's stock price is difficult to predict with high confidence. The potential for a trade war and the political controversy surrounding the appointment likely outweigh the benefit of a potentially more lenient CMA, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on a change in leadership at the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and potential future investigations into Apple.  The appointment of an Amazon executive raises concerns about potential bias against tech companies, particularly given Trump's threats of a trade war against countries that curb US tech giants. While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's operations, the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny in the UK and a more pro-US tech stance from the Trump administration could influence investor sentiment.  A more lenient regulatory environment could be positive for Apple, but the uncertainty introduced by the political landscape and potential investigations creates risk.  The probability of a price rise is lower due to the uncertainty and potential for negative regulatory actions, while the probability of a fall is also not high as the news is not directly negative for Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), replacing Marcus Bokkerink. This change is seen as a signal that the UK government is prioritizing growth and may adopt a more lenient stance towards tech giants like Apple. Additionally, the article mentions potential clashes with the Trump administration over competition rules, which could lead to protectionist policies favoring US tech companies. However, the CMA's ongoing investigations into Apple and Google's dominance in app stores could pose regulatory risks. Overall, the appointment of a tech-friendly CMA chairman and potential US protectionism may be viewed positively by investors, but regulatory uncertainties remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). This move is seen as a signal that the UK government is serious about unlocking growth and may be more lenient towards tech giants. However, the CMA is also preparing an investigation into Apple's and Google's power over smartphone app stores. The article also mentions potential tensions between the UK and the US, with Donald Trump threatening a trade war over competition rules. Given these factors, the news may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased regulatory scrutiny, but the overall effect is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to the government's growth-oriented stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the appointment of a former Amazon executive as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which may signal a more favorable regulatory environment for US tech giants. However, the article also mentions that the CMA is preparing a probe into Apple and Google's power over smartphone app stores, which could potentially negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a shift in the leadership of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) with the appointment of a former Amazon executive. This change might signal a less stringent approach towards regulating tech companies like Apple. However, there is uncertainty around how well the new leadership will work with the current CEO, Sarah Cardell, and whether this will impact Apple positively or negatively. Additionally, the geopolitical tension mentioned with Trump threatening a trade war adds another layer of uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
