(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a key player in the AI sector, which could attract investor interest. However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a significant drop due to analyst downgrades and declining iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may provide some support, the negative sentiment from analysts and market performance suggests a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight edge towards a price rise due to Cramer's influence, but the risk of a price fall remains significant due to existing bearish trends.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer views Apple as a reliable \"quarterback\" for a portfolio, suggesting stability and consistent performance. However, the article also highlights recent underperformance, including a 14% drop due to analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone shipments in China. While the article mentions AI and Cramer's bullishness on the sector, it doesn't directly link Apple's AI capabilities to a significant positive catalyst. The article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic but acknowledges recent headwinds and the potential for other AI investments to outperform Apple. Given the recent negative performance and the lack of a strong, immediate AI-related catalyst, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's positive view of Apple as a stable, long-term investment ('quarterback of your portfolio'), but this is contrasted with the recent negative performance of the stock (-14% since September due to analyst downgrades and decreased iPhone shipments in China).  While Cramer's endorsement is positive, it's not directly tied to any new, significant positive catalyst for Apple's stock price. The article focuses more on other AI-related stocks and Cramer's broader views on the AI market and energy infrastructure.  The recent negative performance and analyst downgrades outweigh the general positive sentiment towards Apple as a long-term hold. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio' due to its steady performance and historical strength. However, the article also notes recent challenges, including a 14% drop in stock price due to analyst downgrades and declining iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement could instill confidence among investors, the mixed signals (positive long-term outlook vs. short-term headwinds) suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact. The probability of a rise is tempered by recent negative performance and analyst sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's positive comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer emphasizes steady production and solid performance, comparing Apple's consistency to a reliable quarterback. While the stock has recently faced some challenges, including analyst downgrades and a report on declining iPhone shipments in China, Cramer's overall bullish stance and the company's strong position in the consumer electronics market suggest a positive outlook. However, the recent performance of the stock has been flat, and there are mixed signals from analyst reports. Based on this, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses Jim Cramer's bullish view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential in the AI sector. However, it also mentions that the stock has been flat since Cramer's comments in September, with a negligible 0.18% gain. Additionally, the stock has lost 14% since late December due to analyst downgrades and a report suggesting a decline in iPhone shipments in China. Despite this, Cramer's analogy of Apple as the 'quarterback of your portfolio' suggests a positive long-term outlook. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively close due to the mixed signals in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and the impact of projects like Stargate on Apple Inc.'s stock. While Cramer praises Apple as a steady performer likened to a 'quarterback' in a portfolio, recent stock performance has been volatile with analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments impacting the stock. Cramer's positive views provide some support, but recent negative developments suggest ongoing market skepticism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish perspective on Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio', which suggests a stable and reliable investment. However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a 14% decline attributed to analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may attract some investor interest, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the recent negative trends. The lack of a strong immediate catalyst for growth in the AI sector specifically related to Apple further tempers optimism. Therefore, while there is some potential for a price rise due to Cramer's influence, the prevailing bearish sentiment leads to a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. Jim Cramer's bullish stance and 'quarterback of your portfolio' analogy provide a positive signal. However, recent negative performance, analyst downgrades, and concerns about iPhone shipments in China weigh heavily. The AI narrative is present but not strongly linked to Apple's immediate prospects. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more balanced view after initial bearishness. Given the mixed signals and the recent negative momentum, I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not as strongly as some previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jim Cramer's bullish sentiment, comparing Apple to a reliable 'quarterback' in a portfolio, suggests long-term stability and potential.  However, this positive sentiment is counterbalanced by recent negative performance, including a 14% drop due to analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales in China.  The article itself downplays Apple's AI prospects relative to other companies, further tempering the positive impact of Cramer's comments. While Cramer's endorsement might offer some short-term support, the prevailing negative market sentiment and lack of a strong, immediate catalyst suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price fall. Considering all factors, a slightly pessimistic outlook is warranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer's bullish stance and his comparison of Apple to a 'quarterback of your portfolio' suggest long-term stability and potential growth, especially in the context of AI. However, the article also highlights recent negative performance, including a 14% drop due to analyst downgrades and declining iPhone shipments in China. While Cramer's endorsement may provide some short-term support, the bearish sentiment from analysts and market performance indicates significant headwinds.

However, the recent performance of AAPL has been mixed, with a notable 14% decline attributed to analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments in China.

Jim Cramer's bullish sentiment and the 'quarterback of your portfolio' analogy suggest long-term stability and potential, counterbalanced by recent negative performance (14% drop since December due to analyst downgrades and declining iPhone shipments in China).
