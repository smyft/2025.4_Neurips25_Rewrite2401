(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts\nNews Content: A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model, which could impact the earnings growth of major tech companies, including Apple. The overall sentiment in the market is cautious, with a significant sell-off in tech stocks, particularly in the Nasdaq. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings estimates are closely tied to the performance of other tech giants, the probability of its stock price falling is higher. The market's reaction indicates a potential shift in investor sentiment away from tech dominance, which could further pressure Apple's stock. Therefore, the estimated probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of DeepSeek, a competitive AI model, on the earnings of major tech companies, including Apple. While the article mentions Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and highlights concerns about Big Tech's future earnings growth, it doesn't directly implicate Apple as being significantly more vulnerable than its peers. The article suggests a potential shift in market dynamics where broader market participation becomes more important, which could be neutral to slightly positive for Apple if it can maintain its earnings while other sectors catch up. However, the overall tone is cautious, suggesting a potential slowdown in the rapid growth of the past two years. Given the uncertainty and the potential for reduced growth expectations, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely in the short term. The article also mentions that roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself, which suggests that the market is not entirely bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat posed by DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to the growth of US tech giants, particularly Nvidia.  While Apple is mentioned as one of the 'Magnificent Seven' whose earnings growth has driven the recent bull market, the article doesn't directly implicate Apple's technology or earnings as being significantly impacted by DeepSeek. The overall market reaction was a decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, driven largely by Nvidia's losses.  However, the article also highlights a shift towards broader market participation, suggesting a potential decrease in the dominance of Big Tech, including Apple. This could lead to less dramatic overall market gains, but doesn't necessarily predict a fall in Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price rise is lower than usual due to the overall negative market sentiment surrounding AI competition and the potential for reduced Big Tech dominance, but Apple's relatively less direct exposure to the DeepSeek threat compared to Nvidia suggests a lower probability of a significant fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about the dominance of US tech giants, including Apple, due to the emergence of a competitive AI model from DeepSeek. This has triggered a sell-off in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, driven by fears that Big Tech's earnings growth might slow. Apple, being part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' is directly impacted by this sentiment. The market reaction suggests a shift away from over-reliance on tech giants, which could lead to short-term downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, Apple's diversified business model might offer some resilience compared to pure AI-dependent firms like Nvidia. Given the current market sentiment, the probability of a fall in Apple's stock price is higher than a rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of a cheaper and competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on US tech giants. It mentions that investors are concerned about the potential decrease in AI chip sales for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which could negatively affect the earnings growth of Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article highlights that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher over the past two years, and any change in this trend could lead to a broader market reaction. However, it also notes that despite the current decline, there are expectations for a broadening of the stock market rally in 2025. Given this context, the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) may experience a slight decline or stagnation as investors reassess their earnings expectations and the competitive landscape in AI technology.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on US tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. The article suggests that this could lead to a decrease in earnings growth for these companies, which have been driving the bull market. However, it also mentions that this could lead to a broader market rally, with more stocks participating in the upside. The article cites experts who believe that the market is due for a change and that 2025 will be a year of returning to normal, with fundamental investing outperforming speculation. Given that Apple is one of the Big Tech companies mentioned in the article, its stock price may be affected by the potential decrease in earnings growth, but also by the potential broader market rally.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Chinese AI company DeepSeek presenting a competitive threat to U.S. tech giants, including Apple Inc. The potential impact on Nvidia and other tech giants could lead to a broader market reaction affecting Big Tech earnings expectations. While Apple is not directly mentioned in the competitive threat, it is part of the broader context of Big Tech and market dynamics.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model to major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment is cautious, with a notable sell-off in tech stocks, particularly affecting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and has benefited from rising earnings estimates, the emergence of a cheaper AI model raises doubts about future growth prospects for Big Tech. This could lead to a downward adjustment in earnings expectations, particularly for companies heavily reliant on AI technology. Given the current market dynamics and the potential for reduced growth in the tech sector, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the earnings of major tech companies, including Apple. While Apple is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' the article doesn't directly implicate Apple as being significantly more vulnerable than its peers. The previous rounds of predictions show a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise, with probabilities of falling ranging from 0.45 to 0.7. Considering the overall cautious tone and the potential for reduced growth expectations, I believe a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely in the short term. However, the fact that 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green despite the index's drop suggests that the market is not entirely bearish. Therefore, I will adjust the probability of a fall slightly downwards compared to the average of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat of DeepSeek's AI model to the earnings growth of major tech companies, particularly Nvidia. While Apple is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent Seven', the impact on Apple is indirect and less pronounced than on companies more directly involved in AI chip manufacturing.  The market reaction shows a broader sell-off, but the article also suggests a potential shift towards broader market participation, which could mitigate the negative impact on Apple.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight leaning towards a price fall. Considering the indirect nature of the threat to Apple, the overall market uncertainty, and the potential for a broader market rally, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, but the difference is not significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI model, which has sparked a sell-off in major indices and raised concerns about the earnings growth of US tech giants, including Apple. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings estimates are tied to the performance of other tech giants, the article does not directly implicate Apple as being significantly more vulnerable than its peers. However, the overall market sentiment is cautious, with a shift away from tech dominance potentially pressuring Apple's stock. The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline. Given the current market reaction and the broader concerns about tech earnings, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model to US tech giants, which has led to a sell-off in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.

Although the article does not directly imply Apple will be significantly more impacted than its peers, the overall sentiment in the market is cautious due to the implications on Big Tech's earnings growth. Several models predict a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling. Considering the cautious market sentiment and historical trends of Apple's performance, it is prudent to assign a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek's AI model to major tech companies, including Apple.

The trend of previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of stock price rising. Therefore, I will adjust the probability of stock price rising to 0.5 and stock price falling to 0.5.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model on the earnings of major tech companies, including Apple.  While the article doesn't directly implicate Apple as being significantly more vulnerable than its peers, the overall market reaction (a decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500) and the prevailing sentiment suggest a potential slowdown in Big Tech's growth.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  However, the article also highlights a potential shift towards broader market participation, which could mitigate the negative impact on Apple.  Considering the indirect nature of the threat to Apple, the overall market uncertainty, and the potential for a broader market rally, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledging the possibility of a less dramatic impact than initially feared.  The consensus from previous models, coupled with the market's reaction, suggests a cautious outlook, but not an overwhelmingly bearish one for Apple specifically.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI model, which has sparked a sell-off in major indices and raised concerns about the earnings growth of US tech giants, including Apple.
