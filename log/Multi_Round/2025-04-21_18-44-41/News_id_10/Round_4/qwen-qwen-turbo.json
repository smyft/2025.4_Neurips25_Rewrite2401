(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a cautious outlook on Apple's stock, with the analyst maintaining a Hold rating and expressing concerns about the potential for a super-cycle or upgrade cycle driven by AI. While Apple's hybrid CapEx model provides some resilience against competition from other Big Tech companies, the overall sentiment remains cautious. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, as the market may react negatively to the uncertainty surrounding future sales and the impact of AI on Apple's business.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollouts could weigh on iPhone sales, and the analyst expresses uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. This suggests potential downside risk. On the other hand, Apple's hybrid CapEx model, allowing it to leverage other companies' AI investments, is seen as a positive, making it less vulnerable to competition like DeepSeek. The analyst maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating a neutral stance. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the concerns about iPhone sales and the lack of a clear AI-driven upgrade cycle, but the mitigated risk from AI competition prevents a strong bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor mitigating the impact of increased AI spending by competitors (like the DeepSeek effect on Nvidia), he maintains a 'Hold' rating on the stock.  This is primarily due to concerns about iPhone sales, stemming from a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle. The analyst's 'Hold' rating suggests a neutral outlook, implying neither a strong bullish nor bearish sentiment.  The lack of a clear positive catalyst from the AI boom, coupled with concerns about iPhone sales, leans slightly towards a negative outlook, but the mitigating factor of the less aggressive CapEx strategy prevents a strongly negative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid CapEx model, which makes it less vulnerable compared to other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft. Analyst Tom Forte maintains a 'Hold' rating on Apple, citing uncertainty about a super-cycle or upgrade cycle driven by AI. While Apple's ability to leverage others' CapEx spending is seen as a strength, the lack of clear catalysts for an iPhone upgrade cycle or significant AI-driven growth may limit upside potential. The mixed sentiment, with no strong bullish or bearish signals, suggests a neutral to slightly cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending. The analyst, Tom Forte, has a Hold rating on Apple stock and expresses concerns about the timing of hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales. However, he also notes that Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable to threats like DeepSeek. The overall tone of the article is neutral, highlighting both potential risks and opportunities. Given this balanced view, the probability of the stock price rising or falling seems evenly distributed, but with a slight bias towards a hold or neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the analyst's Hold rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI-driven super-cycle suggest caution. Additionally, the emergence of DeepSeek has negatively impacted other Big Tech names, but Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive, but the analyst's concerns and the current market uncertainty suggest a lower probability of a significant stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple's stock performance and its position in the AI boom. The analyst, Tom Forte, maintains a Hold rating on AAPL, citing uncertainties surrounding the potential for an iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of AI developments. While Apple's hybrid capex model may mitigate risks posed by AI, the lack of a clear indication of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle suggests cautious sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a cautious outlook for Apple, with the analyst maintaining a Hold rating and expressing concerns about the potential for a super-cycle or upgrade cycle driven by AI. While Apple's hybrid CapEx model provides some resilience against competition, the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales and the timing of hardware and software rollouts weighs on the overall sentiment. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, as the market may react negatively to the uncertainty and mixed signals regarding future sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. The analyst's 'Hold' rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI-driven super-cycle are negative signals. However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model, which allows it to leverage other companies' AI investments, is a positive. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight bearish sentiment. The models consistently predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given this trend and the analyst's cautious outlook, I will maintain a slightly bearish stance, but not as strong as the initial predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor mitigating the impact of increased AI spending by competitors, concerns remain about iPhone sales due to a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  The analyst's 'Hold' rating reflects this neutral stance.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a price fall, but no strong consensus. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a clear bullish catalyst, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's hybrid CapEx model is highlighted as a strength, making it less vulnerable to competitive threats like DeepSeek compared to other Big Tech companies. However, the analyst maintains a Hold rating, expressing uncertainty about a potential iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI and concerns about the timing mismatch between hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales. This cautious sentiment, coupled with the lack of clear bullish catalysts, suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. The overall tone leans towards caution, but Apple's resilience in CapEx spending provides some downside protection.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock performance. The analyst, Tom Forte, maintains a 'Hold' rating on Apple stock, expressing concerns about the potential for a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI.

The lack of a clear positive catalyst from the AI boom, coupled with concerns about iPhone sales, suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. However, the mitigated risk from AI competition and the company's ability to leverage others' spending prevent a strongly bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with the analyst maintaining a Hold rating and expressing concerns about the potential for an iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend towards a cautious outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Taking into account the neutral to slightly cautious sentiment and the lack of clear catalysts for significant growth, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple's stock performance and its position in the AI boom. The analyst, Tom Forte, maintains a Hold rating on AAPL, citing uncertainties surrounding the potential for an iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of AI developments.

The overall sentiment from previous predictions indicates a cautious outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the analyst maintaining a Hold rating and expressing concerns about the potential for a super-cycle or significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. While Apple's hybrid CapEx model is seen as a strength, mitigating some risks from competition, the uncertainties surrounding iPhone sales and the timing of hardware and software rollouts weigh heavily on sentiment. Previous predictions indicate a trend towards a higher probability of stock price falling, reflecting the cautious sentiment in the market. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.41, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.59, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The analyst's 'Hold' rating reflects uncertainty about a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle and concerns about the timing of hardware/software rollouts impacting iPhone sales. However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model is a positive, mitigating risks from AI competition. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a slightly bearish sentiment. Considering these factors, I'll maintain a slightly bearish stance, but not as strong as the initial predictions, and adjust based on the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The analyst's 'Hold' rating and concerns about iPhone sales due to a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts, and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle, are significant negative factors.  However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model, allowing it to leverage other companies' AI investments, is a positive mitigating factor.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, with most models predicting a probability between 0.55 and 0.65.  While Apple's strategic advantage in CapEx spending offers some protection against the negative impacts of increased AI spending by competitors, the lack of a clear positive catalyst from the AI boom and the concerns about iPhone sales outweigh this positive.  Considering the analyst's cautious outlook and the consistent bearish sentiment from previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
