This suggests a potential shift in Apple's advertising strategy, which could be seen as a positive signal for revenue diversification. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal, as the news is more about exploratory discussions rather than a confirmed strategic move. Additionally, the broader market reaction to Amazon's decision was negative (down 1%), possibly due to concerns about X's platform reputation. Given the mixed signals and the exploratory nature of Apple's involvement, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain modest.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
