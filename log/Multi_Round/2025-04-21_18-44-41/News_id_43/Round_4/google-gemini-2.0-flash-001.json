      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is increasing its spending on social media platform X, marking a major U-turn from the e-commerce after scaling back on advertising on the Elon's Musk-owned platform more than a year ago amid concerns about growing hate speech on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe news comes as other companies have also been mulling whether to return to X at a time when Musk has President Donald Trump's ear after playing a key role on election campaign trail.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in recent weeks weeks has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform, a person familiar with the situation told the Journal.\n\nAmazon was down 1% in recent trading.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\n\nKLA Corp earnings beat by $0.45, revenue topped estimates\n\nAtlassian stock soars 18% on earnings beat, strong outlook\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on X, which may suggest a shift in advertising strategies among major companies. Apple is reportedly considering testing ads on the same platform, which could be seen as a positive move for its advertising revenue potential. However, the overall market sentiment may be influenced by Amazon's stock decline and the mixed reactions to advertising on X. Given these factors, there is a moderate chance that Apple's stock price could rise due to potential new revenue streams, but also a risk of falling if market sentiment turns negative due to broader concerns about advertising on the platform.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing ad spending on X, and Apple is considering testing ads on the platform. This suggests a potential increase in revenue for X, which could indirectly benefit companies associated with X, or at least not negatively impact them. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more significant for X and potentially Amazon. The fact that Amazon's stock was down 1% in recent trading suggests the market isn't reacting positively to this news, possibly due to concerns about brand association with X. Given the indirect and potentially neutral impact on Apple, and the slightly negative market reaction to Amazon's involvement, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a small stock price fall for Apple than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform.  While this is positive for X, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news is indirect and doesn't provide any substantial information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The probability of a stock price movement is therefore low in either direction, with the market likely already pricing in the potential for Apple to advertise on X.  Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple (AAPL) has been in discussions about testing ads on X (formerly Twitter), following Amazon's decision to increase ad-spending on the platform. This suggests a potential shift in Apple's advertising strategy, which could be seen as a positive signal for revenue diversification. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal, as the news is more about exploratory discussions rather than a confirmed strategic move. Additionally, the broader market reaction to Amazon's decision was negative (down 1%), possibly due to concerns about X's platform reputation. Given the mixed signals and the exploratory nature of Apple's involvement, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X. However, it also mentions that Apple has had discussions about testing out ads on the same platform. The news does not directly impact Apple's stock price, as it is Amazon's ad spending that is highlighted. Given that the news is more directly related to Amazon and not Apple, and there is no specific information that would suggest a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's business, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral. The mention of Apple is brief and does not provide enough information to suggest a strong reaction in the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on X, a social media platform, which could potentially lead to increased competition for Apple's advertising revenue. However, it also mentions that Apple has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform, which could be a positive development for the company. Given that the news is more related to Amazon and its advertising strategy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform could be seen as a positive sign, potentially leading to a slight increase in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, a platform that Apple is also considering for potential ad testing. This shift in strategy indicates a positive trend for Amazon but does not directly impact Apple's core business. Since the news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct business implications for Apple, it is unlikely to cause immediate significant stock price movements for Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on X, which may suggest a shift in advertising strategies among major companies. Apple is reportedly considering testing ads on the same platform, which could be seen as a positive move for its advertising revenue potential. However, the overall market sentiment may be influenced by Amazon's stock decline and the mixed reactions to advertising on X. Given these factors, there is a moderate chance that Apple's stock price could rise due to potential new revenue streams, but also a risk of falling if market sentiment turns negative due to broader concerns about advertising on the platform. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a rise, but also significant caution due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The previous predictions are varied, with most hovering around a neutral stance (0.55 rise / 0.45 fall). Some models lean slightly towards a fall, citing Amazon's negative stock reaction and the indirect nature of the news for Apple. The key takeaway is that the news is primarily about Amazon and X, with Apple's involvement being exploratory. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the lack of strong direct impact on Apple, I will slightly adjust the probabilities towards a more neutral stance, acknowledging the potential for a slight positive influence due to Apple considering advertising on X, but also the risk of negative sentiment surrounding X impacting the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with Apple's potential ad testing on the platform mentioned only briefly.  While this could be a positive development for Apple's advertising revenue in the long term, the impact is likely to be minimal and indirect.  The news itself is not a significant catalyst for a major stock price movement in either direction.  Amazon's stock price decline following the announcement suggests a degree of market skepticism regarding increased advertising on X.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.2 to 0.55 for a price rise and 0.1 to 0.6 for a price fall, and the overall lack of direct impact on Apple, I lean towards a neutral prediction with a slightly higher probability of no significant change. The uncertainty and indirect nature of the news outweigh the potential for a significant positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X and mentions Apple's exploratory discussions about testing ads on the same platform. While this could hint at potential future revenue streams for Apple, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is minimal as the news is more about Amazon's strategy. The market's reaction to Amazon's move was slightly negative (down 1%), possibly due to concerns about X's platform reputation. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of concrete developments for Apple, the probabilities of a stock price rise or fall are relatively balanced but lean slightly towards a neutral or minimal impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X, and mentions that Apple has had discussions about testing out ads on the same platform.

Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of specific information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral. The market reaction to Amazon's decision was slightly negative (down 1%), which might contribute to a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall for Apple. However, the overall impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on X, and Apple is considering testing ads on the platform. This suggests a potential shift in advertising strategies among major companies. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more significant for X and potentially Amazon. Considering the mixed reactions to advertising on X and the indirect impact on Apple, I estimate a moderate chance of a small stock price movement in either direction. The fact that other models have provided a range of predictions, with some indicating a slightly higher probability of a rise and others a slightly higher probability of a fall, suggests that the market is uncertain about the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Given the exploratory nature of Apple's involvement and the lack of direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects, I predict a relatively neutral probability of the stock price rising or falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X and the consideration of Apple testing ads on the same platform. While Amazon's decision might indirectly affect market sentiments towards platforms like X, it does not present a direct impact on Apple's core businesses. The news hints at potential new revenue streams for Apple through advertising, which could be seen as a positive indicator. However, given the mixed signals and the exploratory nature of Apple's discussions, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be limited. The previous predictions provided a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a marginal increase in stock price due to the potential diversification of revenue streams.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on X, which may suggest a shift in advertising strategies among major companies.

The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a rise, but also significant caution due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X and Apple's consideration of testing ads on the same platform. This is primarily an Amazon story, with a minor implication for Apple. The previous round of predictions shows a convergence towards a neutral stance, with most models hovering around 0.5 for both rise and fall. Some models slightly favor a fall, citing Amazon's negative stock reaction and the indirect nature of the news for Apple. Given the lack of strong direct impact on Apple and the trend of previous predictions, I will maintain a neutral stance, acknowledging the potential for a slight positive influence due to Apple considering advertising on X, but also the risk of negative sentiment surrounding X impacting the stock. The impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with Apple only mentioned as potentially testing ads on the platform.  This is indirect and lacks concrete details about Apple's plans or the financial impact.  Amazon's stock price decline suggests some market skepticism about increased advertising on X, which could indirectly affect Apple.  However, the overall impact on Apple is likely minimal.  The previous predictions show a wide range, clustering around a neutral stance, with a slight bias towards a rise in earlier rounds and a shift towards neutrality in later rounds. Considering the indirect nature of the news, the lack of significant positive or negative information directly related to Apple, and the overall market uncertainty reflected in the previous predictions, I predict a near-neutral probability of price movement.  The slight negative market reaction to Amazon's move slightly increases the probability of a fall, but the overall impact is likely to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with Apple's potential involvement being exploratory and mentioned briefly. This suggests minimal direct impact on Apple's stock price. While the consideration of advertising on X could hint at future revenue diversification, the news lacks concrete developments or financial implications for Apple. The market's reaction to Amazon's move was slightly negative, which might influence sentiment but is not directly tied to Apple. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of significant catalysts, the probabilities of a stock price rise or fall are balanced but lean slightly towards minimal impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X, a social media platform. While Apple is mentioned as considering testing ads on the same platform, the direct impact on its stock price is likely minimal. The market reaction to Amazon's decision was slightly negative, but this does not necessarily translate to a significant movement in Apple's stock price. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of concrete developments for Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, considering the potential for new revenue streams and the positive perception of exploring advertising on X, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on X, and Apple is considering testing ads on the same platform.

This is indirect news with minimal direct impact on Apple's core business or immediate financial prospects.  Amazon's stock price decline following the announcement suggests some market skepticism regarding increased advertising on X, which could indirectly influence sentiment towards other companies considering similar strategies. However, the lack of concrete details about Apple's plans and the exploratory nature of their discussions make a significant price movement unlikely.  The previous predictions show a convergence towards a neutral stance, with probabilities for a rise and fall clustering around 0.5.  Considering the indirect nature of the news, the lack of significant positive or negative information directly related to Apple, and the overall market uncertainty, I predict a near-neutral probability of price movement, slightly favoring a lack of change due to the overall uncertainty and the negative market reaction to Amazon's move.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), with a minor mention of Apple considering testing ads on the same platform. This is largely an Amazon-centric story, and the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and minimal. The exploratory nature of Apple's discussions suggests no immediate financial implication. Previous predictions have converged towards a neutral stance, reflecting the lack of direct impact. Amazon's stock decline (down 1%) indicates some market skepticism about advertising on X, which could marginally influence sentiment around Apple, but not significantly. The probabilities are therefore balanced, with a slight edge to no major movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X and mentions Apple's exploratory discussions about testing ads on the same platform.
