A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple iPhone sales in China, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decrease in Q4 alone. This decline in a major market, especially with competitors like Huawei and Vivo gaining market share, is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the importance of China to Apple's overall sales and growth strategy, this news could lead to a bearish outlook for the stock. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a crucial market for the company. A 17% annual decline and a 25% drop in Q4, coupled with Huawei and Vivo gaining market share, are strong negative indicators. While Apple is exploring other avenues like new stores and credit card partnerships, the immediate impact of losing market share in China is likely to outweigh these positives in the short term. The mention of Alphabet's CEO attending Trump inauguration and Meta's potential benefit from a TikTok ban are less relevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement based on this specific news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple iPhone sales in China across all four quarters of 2024, with a particularly sharp drop of 25% in Q4.  This represents a substantial loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. China is a crucial market for Apple, and this negative trend suggests weakening demand for iPhones in a key region. While Apple's overall performance is not solely dependent on China, this news is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.  The magnitude of the decline (17% annually and 25% in Q4) is considerable and warrants concern.  However, it's important to note that Apple is a large and diversified company, and this news might be already priced into the stock, or the market might view it as a temporary setback.  Therefore, while a price drop is more likely, the probability isn't extremely high due to Apple's overall strength and potential for future growth in other markets.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decline in the last quarter. This suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in China, likely due to increased competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo. Such a negative trend in sales is typically viewed unfavorably by investors, as it may lead to lower revenue and earnings projections.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's iPhone sales in China declined in all four quarters of 2024, with a 25% drop in Q4 and a 17% decline in annual shipments. This decline led to Huawei and Vivo to overtake Apple in market share. The negative sales trend and loss of market share could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, it's worth noting that Apple is a strong and resilient company with a history of innovation and market dominance. The impact of this decline might be partially mitigated by the company's diversified product lineup and loyal customer base. Still, the immediate reaction to this news is likely to be negative, given the focus on declining sales in a significant market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a significant decline of 17% in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position in China. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in some of this decline, and Apple's strong brand and global presence may mitigate some of the negative effects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. This decline has led to a reduction in market share and negative market sentiment. Given these factors, it is likely that the stock price will experience downward pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
