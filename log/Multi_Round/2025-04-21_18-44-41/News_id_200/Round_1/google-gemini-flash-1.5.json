(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

The positive technical indicators and the expectation of strong earnings from major tech companies, including Apple, suggest a favorable environment for AAPL.

Key points supporting this view include the Nasdaq 100's strong performance above its 200-day moving average, the pullback in Treasury yields, and the rotation back into semiconductor stocks, which often benefits Apple. Additionally, the upcoming earnings season and Fed policy decision are pivotal, but the overall sentiment leans towards optimism for Big Tech.
