(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has been underperforming, with an 8% decline in 2025 and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting bearish sentiment among analysts. While there are some positive expectations for China sales and the Services segment, the overall growth has been stagnant, and the lack of revisions in EPS estimates indicates limited optimism. The upcoming earnings report will be critical, but the prevailing sentiment leans towards caution, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report earnings growth, its stock has underperformed recently. Key areas to watch include China sales (which have been weak but are projected to improve), Services revenue (which is expected to be strong), and iPhone sales (particularly regarding the impact of Apple Intelligence). The article also mentions that Apple's top and bottom line growth has been cooling. The current Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment among analysts. Given the recent underperformance, the mixed outlook, and the 'Sell' rating, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual earnings report and management's guidance, especially regarding Apple Intelligence adoption and China performance. A positive surprise in these areas could lead to a stock price increase, but the current indicators suggest a higher likelihood of a negative reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows a modest 8% year-over-year growth, and Services revenue is projected to increase significantly, several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% for the year, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about slowing growth, particularly in the crucial China market (though a positive year-over-year change is forecast). The success of Apple Intelligence is uncertain and will heavily influence investor sentiment.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the potential for a positive surprise from strong Services revenue or better-than-expected China sales exists.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in 2025, with an 8% decline year-to-date. Earnings and sales revisions have been stagnant, with only modest year-over-year growth expected (8% for EPS and 3.7% for revenue). China sales have been a persistent weak spot, though the upcoming report may show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. The Services segment remains strong, but the iPhone's performance and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are uncertain. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) reflects analyst bearishness. Given the mixed outlook and the critical nature of the upcoming earnings report, the stock's movement will likely hinge on whether the positives (Services growth, potential China recovery) outweigh the negatives (stagnant growth, iPhone uncertainty).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. The article highlights that Apple's shares have had a rough start in 2025, down about 8%, and are underperforming the S&P 500. However, the earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. The article also emphasizes key metrics to watch, such as China's results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the current bearish sentiment (Zacks Rank #4) and the importance of guidance and adoption of Apple Intelligence, there is a mixed outlook. However, the unchanged earnings revisions and stable top-line growth suggest a slightly positive bias.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down around 8%. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. However, the company's top-line growth has been cooling, and its China revenue has fallen short of estimates in five consecutive releases. The article mentions that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales is expected to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters, which could be a positive sign. Additionally, Apple's Services segment has been robust, with a consensus estimate of $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure. The iPhone results will also be under scrutiny, as it accounts for nearly 50% of Apple's sales. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be around 0.45, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be around 0.55, due to the overall bearish sentiment among analysts and the company's recent underperformance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been a downward revision in stock performance in 2025, with shares down roughly 8%. However, the earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable, though growth is slowing. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights, particularly if growth in China resumes. However, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests bearishness, and the skepticism around Apple Intelligence may impact investor sentiment negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
