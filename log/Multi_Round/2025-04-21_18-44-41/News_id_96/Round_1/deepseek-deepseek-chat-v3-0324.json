(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Cramer indicates that the consensus estimates for Apple may be overly pessimistic, but he also acknowledges that the company is facing challenges, particularly in the Chinese market. Given the mixed sentiment\u2014Cramer believes in AI's potential but is skeptical about consumer interest in AI PCs\u2014there is a likelihood of continued volatility in AAPL's stock price. The overall sentiment leans towards caution, suggesting a higher probability of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges the potential of AI, he expresses concerns about consumer demand for AI PCs, which could negatively impact Apple's hardware sales. He also mentions reports of iPhone struggles in China. However, Cramer also suggests that the market is already anticipating a potential earnings miss, which could mitigate the negative impact. The article also highlights that other AI stocks may offer better returns. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about consumer AI demand and iPhone sales, but the anticipated earnings miss and Cramer's overall positive view on AI temper the negativity. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's commentary regarding Apple and the AI market. While Cramer acknowledges the potential of AI, particularly in enterprise applications and his personal use of ChatGPT, he expresses skepticism about the consumer AI market and the hype surrounding AI PCs.  He points to a Morgan Stanley survey showing low consumer interest in AI-specific products and suggests that the consensus earnings estimates for Apple are already factoring in potential disappointments.  This suggests a cautious outlook on Apple's short-term performance, although not necessarily a negative one.  The article also highlights that Cramer believes the market is already anticipating a potential earnings miss, reducing the impact of any negative surprise.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but the lack of strong negative sentiment and the acknowledgement of AI's potential in other sectors mitigates the potential for a significant price drop.  The probability of a price rise is lower due to the cautious outlook, but the probability of a fall is also not high due to the already factored-in expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the broader AI PC market. Cramer expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, citing a Morgan Stanley survey that indicates low consumer interest in paying extra for AI features. This could negatively impact Apple's stock, as the company is heavily reliant on consumer electronics like the iPhone, which is also facing challenges in China. However, Cramer remains positive about enterprise AI applications, which might not directly benefit Apple in the short term. The overall sentiment from the news is mixed but leans slightly negative due to concerns over consumer AI adoption and iPhone performance in China.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's views on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and AI, particularly focusing on the lack of consumer enthusiasm for AI PCs and the company's AI initiatives. Cramer's comments suggest that while he sees potential in AI, he is skeptical about the immediate impact on Apple's stock due to lukewarm consumer response and concerns about AI hardware super cycles. He also highlights that investors focus too much on the iPhone and not enough on enterprise AI use cases. Additionally, Cramer's discussion on AI and its applications, including his use of ChatGPT, indicates a neutral to slightly positive view on AI-related stocks but does not express unbridled enthusiasm for AAPL specifically. Given this context, the news seems to be neutral to slightly negative, as it questions the immediate potential for AI-driven stock performance, especially for companies like Apple that are not directly benefiting from the AI hardware super cycle in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle. Cramer expresses skepticism about the consumer demand for AI PCs, citing a Morgan Stanley survey that shows only 15% of respondents bought AI-enabled products primarily for AI features. However, he remains positive about the potential of AI in enterprise use cases and believes that Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected by the lack of consumer demand for AI PCs. Additionally, Cramer mentions that the consensus estimates for Apple's earnings may not be accurate, which could lead to a surprise if the company beats or misses expectations. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to Cramer's comments and the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding Apple's stock performance and AI initiatives.
