Here's why.\nNews Content: DeepSeek, China's latest AI chatbot, is causing concern among Silicon Valley investors. The company claims to have developed a Chinese chatbot at a significantly lower cost than US tech companies, raising questions about the implications for US companies investing heavily in AI development.\n\n\"I still think this is a fairly substantial engineering feat that experts have examined, and they found that these... very young Chinese engineers have done a great job at optimizing and working around constraints in a way that oftentimes we in the West don't, and we throw additional money at it and make these models very expensive,\" Cambrian.ai Co-Founder and CEO Olaf Groth tells Catalysts host Seana Smith.\n\nWhile Groth believes DeepSeek's emergence will be \"good for the market overall,\" he notes that from a geopolitical perspective, it could escalate national security concerns.\n\n\"Open source models that generate a lot of data in the United States, then spreading that much more effectively, that data going to Chinese servers will become an issue at even greater scale,\" he warns.
