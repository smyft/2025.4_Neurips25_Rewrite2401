(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Apple's upcoming earnings report is part of a larger trend where major tech companies are expected to address concerns about AI spending and market conditions. Given the positive momentum from other tech stocks and the expectation that the Fed will maintain interest rates, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will rise. However, uncertainties surrounding AI competition and potential market volatility could lead to a moderate chance of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Positive factors include the overall positive sentiment in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, indicating a potential rebound in tech stocks. ASML's strong results also suggest continued demand in the semiconductor industry, which is indirectly positive for Apple. However, the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek raises concerns about the value of Apple's AI investments, potentially leading to investor skepticism. The Fed's expected decision to hold interest rates steady is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. The upcoming earnings report is a major catalyst, and the market's reaction will depend on Apple's performance and outlook, particularly regarding AI. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the overall market rebound and potential for positive earnings surprises, but the AI concerns and LVMH's disappointing sales growth temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed and doesn't provide a strong directional signal for Apple's stock price.  While the overall market sentiment is slightly positive (Nasdaq and S&P futures are up), the impact of the new Chinese AI model and concerns about tech spending are still present.  Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated, and its performance will heavily influence its stock price.  A positive earnings report, particularly regarding AI initiatives, could outweigh the broader market concerns. However, a disappointing report could lead to a price drop, especially given the existing uncertainty. The Fed's decision is expected to be neutral, having a limited direct impact on Apple. ASML's strong results are positive for the semiconductor sector, which could indirectly benefit Apple.  Overall, the probabilities are weighted towards a slight increase due to the generally positive market sentiment and the anticipation of Apple's earnings, but significant uncertainty remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a mix of factors that could influence Apple's stock price in the short term. On the positive side, there is a general uptick in Nasdaq and S&P futures, which could indicate a broader market recovery after recent declines. Additionally, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' tech firms that have driven market gains, and its upcoming earnings report could be a catalyst for movement. However, there are concerns about the impact of a new low-cost AI model from China, which has sparked fears about the justification of massive AI spending by big tech companies. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged is neutral but could lead to market volatility depending on Chair Powell's comments. Overall, while there are positive indicators, the uncertainty around AI spending and earnings specifics creates a balanced outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the market. The article also mentions the recent sell-off in the tech sector due to concerns over AI spending, but notes that some analysts are dismissing these concerns and predicting an acceleration in demand. Additionally, the strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the Fed's decision and the overall market sentiment. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, and its earnings reports have significant influence on investor sentiment and stock movements. The news indicates a mixed outlook with potential risks from AI developments but also positive momentum from other tech companies' earnings. Given the upcoming earnings release and the overall market stability, there's a moderate likelihood of positive news leading to a stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Apple's upcoming earnings report is highly anticipated, and while there are concerns regarding AI competition from the new Chinese model, the positive momentum from other tech stocks and ASML's strong results suggest a potential rebound. The Fed's expected decision to maintain interest rates is neutral, but the market's reaction will largely depend on Apple's performance and outlook. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise, tempered by the existing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The previous predictions show a slight leaning towards a price increase, with most models hovering around 0.55-0.60 for the probability of a rise. This is likely due to the overall positive market sentiment indicated by the Nasdaq and S&P futures, and the anticipation of Apple's earnings report. However, the concerns about AI spending and the mixed signals from other companies (ASML positive, LVMH negative) introduce uncertainty. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the mixed nature of the news, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, but not significantly, to reflect the continued uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the slightly positive market sentiment (Nasdaq and S&P futures are up), the strong performance of ASML (suggesting continued demand in the semiconductor industry), and the anticipation of Apple's earnings report, which could be a catalyst for positive movement.  However, significant uncertainties remain. The emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model raises concerns about the value proposition of large tech companies' AI investments, potentially impacting investor confidence.  The Fed's decision is expected to be neutral, but Chair Powell's comments could influence market sentiment.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly centered around 0.55 for a price rise and 0.45 for a price fall. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings reports, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the overall positive market trend and the potential for positive earnings surprises, but the AI concerns and the possibility of a disappointing earnings report temper the optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the overall uptick in Nasdaq and S&P futures, indicating a potential rebound in tech stocks, and the strong results from ASML, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report is highly anticipated, and positive results could drive the stock price higher. However, concerns about the impact of a low-cost AI model from China and potential market volatility around the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision introduce uncertainty. The previous predictions from other models also reflect a balanced outlook, with slight optimism leaning towards a stock price rise.

The strong results from ASML, a key supplier of computer chip-making equipment, could also have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.

Considering the mixed signals and the anticipation of Apple's earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall market rebound and potential for positive earnings surprises, but with a significant portion of uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a cautiously optimistic market sentiment with Nasdaq and S&P futures ticking up, partially recovering from recent declines. Apple Inc.'s upcoming earnings report, combined with the general positive market momentum, suggests a higher probability of stock price rise. However, concerns around the impact of a new low-cost AI model and uncertainties related to earnings specifics create a balanced outlook.

While concerns about AI competition persist, the positive momentum from other tech stocks and ASML's strong results suggest a potential for a positive surprise. The Fed's expected decision to maintain interest rates is likely neutral. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the mixed nature of the news, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, but not significantly, to reflect the continued uncertainty. The previous round of predictions shows a consensus around 0.58-0.6 for the probability of a rise. I'll adjust slightly upwards, considering the continued positive market signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

However, the AI concerns and the possibility of a disappointing earnings report temper the optimism.
