(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's significant developments in the cloud computing space, which could indirectly impact Apple due to the competitive landscape in technology. However, Apple has recently experienced a notable decline in its stock price, attributed to weak iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts. Given the current negative sentiment surrounding Apple and the lack of direct positive news for the company, the probability of its stock price falling is higher than that of it rising. The overall market sentiment and recent performance suggest a cautious outlook for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Oracle's potential growth in the cloud computing market due to a new joint venture and potential support from President Trump. While the venture is ambitious and could significantly boost Oracle's cloud infrastructure sales, there are also concerns about its feasibility and the sustainability of the positive sentiment. The article also mentions Elon Musk and Anthropic's CEO questioning the project's financing and feasibility. Additionally, the article highlights Apple's recent struggles with weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, suggesting a negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the negative news for Apple and the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Oracle's significant investment in AI and cloud computing, driven by a partnership with SoftBank and OpenAI, and seemingly endorsed by President Trump. While this is positive for Oracle, the news piece explicitly discusses Apple (AAPL) in a negative context.  Apple is experiencing weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and faces potential challenges in the Indian market.  The Oracle news is irrelevant to Apple's prospects. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is higher, given the existing negative sentiment surrounding the company's performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Oracle Corp.'s (ORCL) strategic moves in cloud computing and AI, backed by a joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, as well as political support from former President Trump. While this could be seen as a positive development for Oracle, the article also highlights skepticism from analysts and market participants regarding the feasibility and impact of these plans. The stock has already seen significant gains, and its valuation is high compared to historical averages, which might limit further upside. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the news mentions a slump in its stock price due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, which are unrelated to the Oracle story. Given the negative sentiment around Apple's performance, the probability of a further decline is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Oracle Corp.'s recent advancements and partnerships in the cloud and AI sectors, which has positively impacted its stock. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) recent stock performance, noting an almost 11% slump in January, its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Weak iPhone sales are a growing concern for investors, and at least two analysts downgraded their ratings on the stock. Given this context, it seems that Apple's stock price might continue to face downward pressure due to concerns over iPhone sales and competition in the tech industry.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Oracle's joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to expand its cloud business, which could potentially lead to growth for Oracle. However, the article mentions that the impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a decline in stock price due to weak iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts. The news about Oracle does not directly affect Apple's stock price, but the overall trends in the tech industry may have an indirect impact. Given the information about Apple's struggles with iPhone sales and the lack of direct connection to the Oracle news, the probabilities of Apple's stock price movement are estimated based on the overall negative tone of the article regarding Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's ambitious plans involving a significant joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud business with the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While this news is positive and indicates potential growth for Oracle, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news may indirectly influence investor sentiment towards cloud computing stocks. Apple Inc. has faced recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, leading to a decline in stock price. The indirect impact of Oracle's news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's significant developments in the cloud computing space, which could indirectly impact Apple due to the competitive landscape in technology. However, Apple has recently experienced a notable decline in its stock price, attributed to weak iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts. The overall sentiment surrounding Apple remains negative, and the lack of direct positive news for the company suggests a higher probability of its stock price falling. Given the context of Oracle's advancements and the skepticism surrounding them, the negative outlook for Apple is reinforced, leading to a higher probability of a decline in its stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment surrounding Apple (AAPL) due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, as highlighted in the news and previous predictions, continues to weigh on the stock. While Oracle's developments in cloud computing are significant, they don't directly benefit Apple and may even intensify competition. The previous rounds consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock falling, and there's no new information to suggest a change in this trend. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling remains higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news focuses on Oracle's significant investment in AI and cloud computing, which is largely irrelevant to Apple's current situation.  Apple's stock is already down significantly due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades.  The Oracle news provides no positive catalyst for Apple. While the broader tech sector might be indirectly affected by Oracle's moves, the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance and the lack of any positive news for Apple in this article strongly suggest a continued downward trend. The previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.  Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle Corp.'s strategic moves in cloud computing and AI, which does not directly impact Apple Inc.

Apple is still facing headwinds from weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades.
