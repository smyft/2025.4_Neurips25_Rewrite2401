The phrase \\\"still printing money\\\" is positive, indicating strong financial performance. Conversely, \\\"trades at an above-average valuation\\\" is negative, suggesting the stock might be overvalued. The overall impact is neutral to slightly positive. The market's reaction will depend on whether investors focus on the profitability or the valuation.
