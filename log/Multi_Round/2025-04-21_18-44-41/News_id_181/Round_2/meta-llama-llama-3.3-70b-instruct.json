(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

Given Apple's strong position in the market, its ongoing innovations in AI, and the fact that it remains a major holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, this news is likely to be perceived positively by investors. The mention of AI advancements and Apple's large user base suggests potential for future growth, which could lead to an increase in stock price. However, the recent selling of a portion of Berkshire's stake may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strategic positioning outweighs the potential negative impact of the stake reduction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett has been reducing his position in Apple. The article emphasizes Apple's AI capabilities and its potential to become a major AI distributor. While the continued large holding by Berkshire is a positive signal, the fact that Buffett reduced his position suggests some level of concern or profit-taking. The overall market sentiment towards AI is positive, which could benefit Apple. However, the article also mentions that Buffett sold over half of his position, which could create some uncertainty. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (22.7% of its portfolio), and that Apple is actively integrating AI into its products and services.  While Berkshire Hathaway did sell off a portion of its Apple holdings previously, the remaining stake is substantial and reflects continued confidence in Apple's future.  The article emphasizes Apple's large user base and potential to become a major AI distributor.  However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it discusses Buffett's AI investments across multiple companies.  Therefore, the positive impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be diluted by the broader context.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will also influence Apple's stock price.  A rise is more likely than a fall due to the positive association with Buffett's investment and Apple's AI initiatives, but the probability is not overwhelmingly high given the shared focus on multiple companies.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which constitutes 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite Berkshire selling half of its position earlier in 2024, Apple remains its largest holding. The article emphasizes Apple's strategic focus on AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence and integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which could position Apple as a major player in consumer AI. Given Buffett's long-term investment philosophy and Apple's strong market position and AI initiatives, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors. However, the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the fact that Berkshire has already reduced its stake, which might signal some caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights that 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 billion portfolio is invested in four AI stocks: Domino's Pizza, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Apple. Specifically, Apple accounts for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The article emphasizes Apple's preparation for the AI revolution with its Apple Intelligence software and the potential for Apple to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Given Warren Buffett's influence and the positive outlook on AI integration, this news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's investment in four AI-related stocks, including Apple, which accounts for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The article mentions Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, such as the launch of Apple Intelligence software. This suggests that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for AI technology. Additionally, the fact that Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, has a significant stake in Apple, adds to the company's credibility and potential for long-term growth. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc., which is a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, has been making strides in AI technology through new hardware designs and software features. This indicates a strategic focus on a rapidly growing sector, which is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the fact that Buffett sold over half of Apple's position suggests some caution or a need for capital allocation elsewhere, potentially impacting sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which constitutes 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite a recent reduction in Berkshire's stake, Apple's ongoing innovations in AI and its potential to become a major distributor of AI technology are likely to be viewed positively by investors. The overall sentiment around AI is strong, and Buffett's continued investment in Apple suggests confidence in its long-term prospects. However, the reduction in stake may introduce some caution among investors. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the news highlighting Buffett's significant investment and Apple's AI initiatives. Most models predict a higher probability of a price rise. However, the fact that Buffett reduced his stake is a recurring concern. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the consistent emphasis on Apple's AI advancements, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more optimistic outlook, while still acknowledging the potential negative signal from the stake reduction. The overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and Apple's strategic positioning continues to outweigh the concerns about the stake reduction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Warren Buffett's AI investments, with Apple being a significant holding (22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio). While the article highlights Apple's AI initiatives and potential, the fact that Buffett significantly reduced his Apple stake earlier in the year introduces a countervailing force.  The positive sentiment surrounding Apple's AI integration is tempered by the potential interpretation of the stake reduction as a sign of caution or profit-taking.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, and the mixed signals in the news itself, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned. The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the uncertainty introduced by the prior sale of Apple stock by Berkshire Hathaway.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio (22.7%) and its strategic focus on AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence and integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. This positions Apple as a key player in the AI sector, which is likely to be viewed positively by investors. However, Berkshire Hathaway's recent reduction of its Apple stake introduces some uncertainty. The overall sentiment is positive due to Apple's strong market position and AI advancements, but the probability of a rise is tempered by the stake reduction. Previous predictions also indicate a generally positive outlook with some caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of its portfolio.

Given Buffett's long-term investment philosophy and Apple's strong market position and AI initiatives, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors. However, the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the fact that Berkshire has already reduced its stake, which might signal some caution. Considering the positive association with Buffett's investment and Apple's AI initiatives, a rise is more likely than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which constitutes 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.
