(AAPL)\nNews Headline: China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\nNews Content: Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter having just finished\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this Financial Times article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant technological advancement in China regarding memory chips, which could impact the semiconductor market. However, it also mentions Apple's development of its first chips in the US, indicating a strategic move towards self-sufficiency and potentially reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This duality suggests that while competition may increase due to China's advancements, Apple's innovation could bolster its market position. Overall, the positive implications of Apple's progress may outweigh the concerns raised by the competition, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two potentially conflicting pieces of information. \"China's memory breakthrough\" could be interpreted negatively for Apple as it might increase competition and potentially lower component costs, impacting Apple's profit margins (though lower costs could also be beneficial). \"Apple's first US chips\" is generally positive, suggesting a move towards greater supply chain independence and potentially higher quality/customization of components, which could boost investor confidence. However, without the full article, it's impossible to assess the magnitude of each event's impact. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise due to the positive sentiment around US-based chip production, but acknowledging the uncertainty introduced by the Chinese memory breakthrough.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline is incomplete and lacks crucial details.  We only know that China has made a memory breakthrough and that Apple is using US-made chips.  Without knowing the specifics of either development, it's impossible to accurately assess their impact on Apple's stock price.  A memory breakthrough in China could be positive or negative for Apple, depending on whether it impacts Apple's supply chain, competition, or overall market dynamics. Similarly, Apple using US-made chips could be viewed positively (reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, supporting domestic manufacturing) or negatively (potentially higher costs). The lack of information prevents a meaningful prediction.  Therefore, I will assign probabilities reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests a significant development related to China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips. However, the full content of the article is behind a paywall, limiting the ability to fully analyze the implications. Based on the headline alone, the news could be interpreted as positive for Apple if it indicates advancements in chip technology or supply chain diversification, which might improve production efficiency or reduce costs. Conversely, if China's memory breakthrough poses competitive threats or disrupts Apple's supply chain, it could be negative. Given the lack of detailed information, the probabilities are estimated with moderate uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips. This could be perceived as a positive development for Apple, as it may reduce its dependence on foreign chip suppliers and potentially improve its supply chain resilience. However, the lack of specific details in the headline makes it difficult to assess the material impact on Apple's business. Given the neutral to positive tone, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, which could indicate a potential shift in Apple's supply chain and manufacturing strategy. This development might lead to increased efficiency, reduced dependence on international suppliers, and improved profitability for Apple. However, without access to the full article, the exact implications and potential impact on Apple's stock price are uncertain. Generally, advancements in technology and manufacturing can be seen as positive for a company's stock. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, which suggests a potential shift in Apple's supply chain and production strategy. This could be seen as a positive move towards reducing dependency on foreign manufacturers, potentially improving long-term profitability and reducing geopolitical risks. However, the headline is incomplete and does not provide full context. Assuming this news could positively impact investor sentiment, there is a moderate likelihood of stock price increase.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
