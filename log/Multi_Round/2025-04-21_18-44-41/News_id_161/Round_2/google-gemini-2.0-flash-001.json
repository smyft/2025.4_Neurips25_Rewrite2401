(AAPL) the Best Dow Stock to Buy Right Now?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with record revenue and growth in its services sector. The positive sentiment around tech stocks, particularly in the context of AI advancements, suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL. However, the article also mentions that while AAPL is a solid investment, there are other AI stocks that may offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the strong fundamentals and market position of Apple lead to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong position in the market, solid financial performance (record revenue, strong iPhone sales, growing services sector), and inclusion in a list of 'best Dow stocks,' it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article highlights the overall positive market sentiment towards tech stocks and the potential boost from AI initiatives. However, the article's conclusion that other AI stocks are more promising than AAPL tempers the positive aspects. The hedge fund sentiment (158 holders) is positive, but the ranking of 5th among Dow stocks suggests there are other more favored options. The overall economic outlook is positive, which should help all stocks. Considering these factors, the news is slightly positive, but the emphasis on potentially better AI investments creates some uncertainty. Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong Q4 2024 performance, with record revenue and growth in both iPhone sales and services.  However, the article's main focus is on comparing Apple to other Dow stocks and, more significantly, to AI stocks.  While acknowledging Apple's positive performance and its position as a top Dow stock, the article expresses a stronger belief in the potential of AI stocks for higher and faster returns.  The mention of CDT Capital Management's cautious view on current AI valuations adds a layer of uncertainty.  Therefore, while Apple's fundamentals appear strong, the article's overall tone suggests a relatively neutral outlook on its immediate stock price movement compared to other, potentially faster-growing sectors.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the comparative analysis favoring AI stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now, citing its strong performance, record revenue growth, and dominance in the consumer electronics sector. The company's iPhone sales and services revenue have shown significant growth, contributing to its robust financial health. Additionally, the broader market trends, including the surge in tech stocks due to AI initiatives and a favorable economic outlook, further support a positive sentiment around AAPL. However, the article also mentions that AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, which could divert some investor attention away from AAPL. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the potential negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy, highlighting its strong performance, particularly in its Services business segment. The company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, with iPhone revenue and services revenue reaching record highs. However, the article also mentions that the conviction for AAPL's growth lies in its potential, but AI stocks are believed to hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. The overall sentiment is neutral to positive, but not extremely bullish. Considering the current market trends, economic conditions, and the company's performance, there is a moderate likelihood of the stock price rising, but also a possibility of it falling if investors shift focus to AI stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position among the best Dow stocks to buy, highlighting its stable performance, dividend yields, and growth prospects. The article also mentions the company's record revenue and strong iPhone sales. However, it notes that hedge funds may prefer AI stocks for higher returns. Considering the overall positive tone and the company's solid financials, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. Nevertheless, the article's suggestion that AI stocks might be more promising and the fact that Apple ranks 5th on the list of best Dow stocks to buy introduce some uncertainty, leading to a non-negligible probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong financial performance and its position as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now. However, the article suggests that AI stocks may hold greater promise for higher returns in the near future. This could slightly diminish the attractiveness of Apple in comparison to pure-play AI stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including record revenue and growth in its services sector, which positions it favorably among Dow stocks. However, the article also emphasizes that other AI stocks may offer higher returns, which could temper investor enthusiasm for AAPL. The overall sentiment is positive due to Apple's solid fundamentals and its ranking among the best Dow stocks, but the mention of potentially better investment opportunities in AI stocks introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of it falling due to competitive pressures from AI stocks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's strong financial performance, solid market position, and inclusion in a list of 'best Dow stocks,' it also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The previous round of predictions shows a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a price rise, but some acknowledging the potential for AI stocks to draw investment away from Apple. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the content of the news, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly more conservative, acknowledging the potential impact of AI stock competition.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights strong Q4 2024 results, record revenue, and a robust position in the Dow Jones, it also emphasizes the potentially higher returns offered by AI stocks.  The article's ranking of Apple as only the 5th best Dow stock to buy, despite its strong performance, suggests that other companies are viewed more favorably by the analysts.  The high number of hedge fund holders (158) is positive, but the overall tone leans towards a more neutral or slightly cautious outlook compared to the enthusiasm surrounding AI investments.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.45 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the mixed signals in the news itself, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for investor interest to shift towards AI-focused companies.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong financial performance, record revenue, and growth in its services sector. The company's inclusion in the list of best Dow stocks to buy and the overall positive sentiment around tech stocks, especially in the context of AI advancements, support a favorable outlook. However, the article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns, which could divert some investor attention. Considering the strong fundamentals and market position of Apple, along with the mixed signals from the article, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy, highlighting its strong financial performance, record revenue, and growth in services. However, it also mentions that AI stocks might offer higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering the company's solid position in the market, its dominance in consumer electronics, and the overall positive economic outlook, there is a favorable sentiment towards AAPL. Nevertheless, the comparison to other AI stocks and their potential for higher returns introduces some uncertainty. Based on this analysis, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, but with a moderate outlook due to the potential competition from AI stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance, record revenue, and growth in its services sector. The overall market sentiment towards tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI, is also favorable. However, the article suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, which could slightly temper the enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering the strong fundamentals of Apple, its position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the positive broader market trends, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling. The predictions from other models and the overall economic outlook further support this assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance in terms of revenue and sales growth, particularly in its services sector and iPhone sales. The company is included in a list of best Dow stocks to buy, which positively impacts its reputation and market standing. However, the article also emphasizes the potential of AI stocks to deliver higher returns more quickly, which could attract investor attention away from established tech companies like Apple. The various predictions from different models suggest a moderate to high probability of stock price rise due to the strong fundamentals, but this is somewhat tempered by the comparative analysis favoring AI stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
