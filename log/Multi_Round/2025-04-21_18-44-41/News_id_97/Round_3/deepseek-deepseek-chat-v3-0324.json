(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\nNews Content: Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth. These include the cyclical recovery in its Optical business, the Lumen/Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program ramps, opportunities in the Solar sector, consistent profitability in the Display segment, and its upcoming Investor Day on March 18.\n\nFor HPE, which saw its shares sink 5.8%, the firm points to the Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) acquisition and cost reduction initiatives as factors that could improve margins.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAI server exposure is not embedded in the valuation multiple,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan added.\n\nBofA also sees a significant value unlock for Western Digital with its anticipated spin-off, estimating value creation between $5-10 billion. The firm also references the SanDisk Analyst Day (February 11) and Western Digital Analyst Day (February 12) as key catalysts. The company\u2019s stock lost 4.5% Monday.\n\nSeagate also saw a pullback, but BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing improvements in the HDD industry structure since the last downturn.\n\nThe company's focus on ramping up Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, increasing gross margins through a higher mix of high-capacity/HAMR drives, and continued data center spending (excluding AI) are seen as primary growth drivers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA sees a buying opportunity in Apple, IBM shares after DeepSeek selloff\n\nMorgan Stanley cuts Nvidia stock target after DeepSeek release\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; Fed meeting, tech sector in focus\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a buying opportunity for Apple due to its defensive nature and potential growth amid market volatility. Despite a broader market sell-off, Apple shares rose 3%, indicating investor confidence.
