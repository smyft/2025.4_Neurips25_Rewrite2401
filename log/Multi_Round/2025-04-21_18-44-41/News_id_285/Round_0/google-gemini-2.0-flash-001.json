While Apple is likely among the companies mentioned (being one of the 10 largest), the headline doesn't specifically mention Apple's AI initiatives or any specific advantage/disadvantage they might have in this area. The general trend towards AI is positive for the tech sector as a whole, but the lack of specific information about Apple's position makes a strong positive or negative prediction difficult. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise, as AI investment is generally seen as a growth area, but the effect is likely to be moderate without more specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI.
