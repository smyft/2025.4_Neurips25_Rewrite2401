The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), alongside strong performance in multiple product categories, particularly iPhones and services. The company sets an all-time record for overall revenue and EPS, and it returned a significant amount to shareholders through buybacks. The positive growth in services revenue and the installed base of active devices further substantiate this positive outlook. However, challenges in the Greater China market and a decline in wearables may temper some optimism. Overall, the substantial positive financial results suggest a higher likelihood of stock price increase, despite the presence of some headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive. Apple reported record revenue and EPS, strong growth in key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, and a growing installed base. The company is also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. The introduction of Apple Intelligence is showing positive results where available. However, there are some negatives: a significant revenue decline in Greater China, a slight decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. The decline in China is concerning, albeit partially attributable to channel inventory adjustments. The future impact of operating expense increase must also be monitored. The discussion of Apple Intelligence impacting upgrade cycles in markets it is available is promising for the future, as is growth in emerging markets like India. Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  The strong performance in iPhone sales, driven partly by Apple Intelligence in available markets, is a significant positive.  However, the decline in Greater China revenue due to inventory adjustments and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, along with increased operating expenses, presents a counterpoint.  The success in emerging markets offers a potential offset to China's challenges.  Overall, the record financial performance outweighs the negative factors, although the China market remains a concern. The positive outlook on future innovation and the robust upgrade cycle also contribute to a positive outlook.  Considering these factors, a price rise is more likely, but the uncertainty around China and expenses suggests the probability won't be overwhelmingly high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed but overall positive outlook. Key positive indicators include record revenue and EPS, strong performance in multiple regions, significant growth in Services revenue, and a record installed base of active devices. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has also positively impacted iPhone sales in markets where it is available. However, there are notable negatives such as a decline in Greater China revenue, a slight decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. The competitive pressures in China and the absence of Apple Intelligence there are also concerns. Given the strong overall performance and the potential for growth in emerging markets, the positive aspects likely outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company's performance was driven by strong iPhone sales, record Services revenue, and growth in emerging markets. However, challenges in Greater China, with an 11% year-over-year decline in revenue, and a 2% decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, are notable concerns. Despite these challenges, the overall positive financial results, including a record installed base of active devices and significant capital return to shareholders, are likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price. The company's optimistic outlook on innovation and growth in emerging markets further supports a positive stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The company reported record revenue and EPS, with strong performance in multiple regions and product segments, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has contributed to stronger iPhone sales, and the company sees significant room for innovation in smartphones. However, there are challenges in Greater China, with revenue declining 11% year over year, and foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue. Despite these challenges, the company's overall strong performance and growing installed base of active devices suggest a positive outlook. Given the mixed results, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong revenue and EPS growth, as well as the potential for future innovation and growth in emerging markets.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows strong financial performance with record revenue and EPS, driven largely by iPhone sales and a robust services segment. The 4% revenue growth year-over-year and the increasing installed base of devices indicate solid customer demand. However, the significant decline in revenue from Greater China and challenges in the wearables segment pose concerns. Despite these headwinds, the positive aspects, including record performance in multiple markets and ongoing growth in services and emerging markets, suggest a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Balancing these factors, I estimate a strong probability of a price rise, moderated by the existing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.77, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.23, Reasoning: The overwhelmingly positive earnings report, featuring record revenue, EPS, strong growth in most segments, and a growing installed base, points toward a positive stock reaction. While challenges in Greater China, increased operating expenses, and a slight decline in wearables are present, they are overshadowed by the strong overall results and the positive impact of Apple Intelligence where available and strong performance in other regions. The positive comments regarding product pipeline and emerging markets reinforce this assessment. Consistent predictions from other models in the previous rounds also indicate rising stock prices. Therefore, probability is only slightly increased from initial models.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings significantly exceeded expectations, reporting record revenue and EPS.  The strong performance across multiple product lines, particularly iPhones and Services, is very positive.  Growth in emerging markets offers a promising counterbalance to the decline in Greater China, which while concerning (11% YoY decrease), appears partially explained by inventory adjustments. Increased operating expenses and foreign exchange headwinds are negative factors to consider.  However, the overall picture is overwhelmingly positive due to the record-breaking financial results.  The consistent positive predictions from various AI models also supports a bullish outlook.  While the China market and rising expenses present some risk, the strength of the rest of the results justifies a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a strong overall performance with record revenue and EPS, driven by growth in key segments such as iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, as well as a record installed base of active devices. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has positively impacted iPhone sales in markets where it's available, and the company is optimistic about future innovation and growth in emerging markets. However, there are notable challenges, including an 11% decline in Greater China revenue, a slight decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. Despite these negatives, the robust financial results and strategic initiatives suggest a favorable market reaction. The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with most models estimating a 70-75% chance of an increase. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the consensus of previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong earnings and growth potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) highlights several positive factors, including record revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, and record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Strong performances in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services revenue, along with a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion active devices, contribute to a positive outlook. However, challenges such as an 11% decline in Greater China revenue, a 2% decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and expected foreign exchange headwinds present some concerns. Despite these mixed results, the overall positive financial performance and potential for future innovation and growth in emerging markets suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported record revenue and EPS, with strong growth in multiple product segments, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has positively impacted iPhone sales in available markets. Despite challenges in Greater China and a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall positive financial results and growing installed base of active devices suggest a favorable impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which also indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong revenue and EPS growth, as well as the potential for future innovation and growth in emerging markets, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.77, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.23, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported strong financial results for Q1 2025, achieving record revenue and EPS, driven mainly by robust iPhone and services sales. The installed base of active devices also hit an all-time high, which indicates good customer loyalty and potential for future revenue growth. However, the decline in revenue from Greater China and challenges within the wearables segment pose significant concerns. Despite these issues, the overall performance remains positive, and the company's focus on emerging markets and new product innovations provides an optimistic outlook for future growth. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, I estimate a high probability for the stock price to rise, albeit moderated by existing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings demonstrate robust financial health with record revenue, EPS, and growth in key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. A growing installed base and positive impact from Apple Intelligence where available further contribute to a positive outlook. However, a decline in Greater China revenue, increased operating expenses, and a slight dip in wearables pose challenges. Considering that previous predictions also lean towards a rise, plus the GuruFocus warning sign, the probability of stock rise is high but not very high, which is adjusted slightly according to the various considerations given.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings significantly exceeded expectations, reporting record revenue and EPS.  This positive performance across multiple product lines, particularly iPhones and Services, is very positive and strongly suggests a stock price increase. Growth in emerging markets offers a promising counterbalance to the decline in Greater China, which, while concerning (11% YoY decrease), appears partially explained by inventory adjustments.  Increased operating expenses and foreign exchange headwinds are negative factors, but are outweighed by the record-breaking financial results.  The consistent positive predictions from various AI models also support a bullish outlook.  While the China market and rising expenses present some risk, the strength of the overall financial results justifies a high probability of a stock price increase.  The consensus of previous predictions, showing a trend towards higher probabilities of a price rise after consideration of both positive and negative factors, further reinforces this conclusion. However, maintaining a probability slightly below 1 acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in the market and potential unforeseen factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc.

(AAPL) reported record revenue and EPS for Q1 2025, with strong performances in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services segments. The company's installed base of active devices reached a new high of over 2.35 billion. Despite challenges such as an 11% decline in Greater China revenue and a 2% decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall positive financial results and potential for future innovation and growth in emerging markets suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has positively impacted iPhone sales in markets where it is available, and the company returned over $30 billion to shareholders. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, along with the consensus of previous predictions from various models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed but overall positive outlook, with record revenue and EPS, strong growth in multiple product segments, and a growing installed base of active devices.

Despite these positives, there are notable concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue, a slight decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. The previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a relatively high probability of a stock price rise due to the strongly positive financial performance, particularly in revenue and EPS growth, alongside the positive sentiments about future innovation and growth potential. Although there are certain challenges, they seem to be outweighed by the overwhelmingly positive aspects.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report showcases record revenue and EPS, driven by strong performance in key segments such as iPhone and services. Despite the challenges in Greater China and a decline in wearables, the overwhelming positive financial indicators, including a growing installed base and strong performance in emerging markets, support a bullish outlook for the stock. The balance of positive factors outweighing the negatives leads to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings demonstrate a strong financial performance with record revenue and EPS. Growth is seen across multiple product segments, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The installed base is also growing, and Apple Intelligence's impact is positive where available. However, there are headwinds, including a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. GuruFocus also detected 3 warning signs. While previous rounds of predictions largely lean towards a price increase, I feel that there are reasons for price decline based on GuruFocus warning signs and loss of the Chinese market. The high capital return to shareholders may also be seen as the company running out of ideas for innovation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are undeniably positive, driven by strong iPhone sales and the burgeoning Services sector.  The significant growth in emerging markets, particularly India, offers a promising counterbalance to the concerning 11% decline in Greater China revenue (partially attributed to channel inventory adjustments).  The success of Apple Intelligence where implemented is encouraging for future growth, but its absence in China remains a significant headwind. Increased operating expenses and foreign exchange headwinds also temper the overall positive sentiment.  The consensus of previous model predictions shows a consistent leaning towards a stock price rise, generally in the 70-80% range.  However, the significant challenges in China and increasing operating costs warrant caution.  Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth potential in emerging markets, and the consistent positive predictions from previous models, but with a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the China market and expenses, I predict a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple Inc.

Despite these challenges, the overall positive financial results and strategic initiatives suggest a favorable market reaction. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with most models estimating a 70-75% chance of an increase.
