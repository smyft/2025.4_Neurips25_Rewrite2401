The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), alongside strong performance in multiple product categories, particularly iPhones and services. The company sets an all-time record for overall revenue and EPS, and it returned a significant amount to shareholders through buybacks. The positive growth in services revenue and the installed base of active devices further substantiate this positive outlook. However, challenges in the Greater China market and a decline in wearables may temper some optimism. Overall, the substantial positive financial results suggest a higher likelihood of stock price increase, despite the presence of some headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive. Apple reported record revenue and EPS, strong growth in key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, and a growing installed base. The company is also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. The introduction of Apple Intelligence is showing positive results where available. However, there are some negatives: a significant revenue decline in Greater China, a slight decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. The decline in China is concerning, albeit partially attributable to channel inventory adjustments. The future impact of operating expense increase must also be monitored. The discussion of Apple Intelligence impacting upgrade cycles in markets it is available is promising for the future, as is growth in emerging markets like India. Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  The strong performance in iPhone sales, driven partly by Apple Intelligence in available markets, is a significant positive.  However, the decline in Greater China revenue due to inventory adjustments and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, along with increased operating expenses, presents a counterpoint.  The success in emerging markets offers a potential offset to China's challenges.  Overall, the record financial performance outweighs the negative factors, although the China market remains a concern. The positive outlook on future innovation and the robust upgrade cycle also contribute to a positive outlook.  Considering these factors, a price rise is more likely, but the uncertainty around China and expenses suggests the probability won't be overwhelmingly high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed but overall positive outlook. Key positive indicators include record revenue and EPS, strong performance in multiple regions, significant growth in Services revenue, and a record installed base of active devices. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has also positively impacted iPhone sales in markets where it is available. However, there are notable negatives such as a decline in Greater China revenue, a slight decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. The competitive pressures in China and the absence of Apple Intelligence there are also concerns. Given the strong overall performance and the potential for growth in emerging markets, the positive aspects likely outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company's performance was driven by strong iPhone sales, record Services revenue, and growth in emerging markets. However, challenges in Greater China, with an 11% year-over-year decline in revenue, and a 2% decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, are notable concerns. Despite these challenges, the overall positive financial results, including a record installed base of active devices and significant capital return to shareholders, are likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price. The company's optimistic outlook on innovation and growth in emerging markets further supports a positive stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The company reported record revenue and EPS, with strong performance in multiple regions and product segments, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has contributed to stronger iPhone sales, and the company sees significant room for innovation in smartphones. However, there are challenges in Greater China, with revenue declining 11% year over year, and foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue. Despite these challenges, the company's overall strong performance and growing installed base of active devices suggest a positive outlook. Given the mixed results, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strong revenue and EPS growth, as well as the potential for future innovation and growth in emerging markets.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue.
