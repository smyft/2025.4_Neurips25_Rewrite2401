(AAPL)\nNews Headline: The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Microsoft\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Apple Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAppleis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nApple expects the December quarter's (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAAPL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\n\nLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple's fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion.\n\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple's installed base has been a concern.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL's Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple's Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple's Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple's estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC's vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo's growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies and HP saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies' 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple's market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\n\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner's list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 27.5%.\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple's AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \"Magnificent 7\" group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple's stringent privacy standards.\n\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple's near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in revenues and services, concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly due to competition in China, and a stretched valuation suggest potential headwinds. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish sentiment among analysts. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to grow, driven by Services and Mac sales, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competition in China and a delayed AI launch. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment. The underperformance of AAPL compared to the sector and a stretched valuation are also concerning. However, the positive long-term impact of Apple Intelligence and the growth in the Services segment offer some upside potential. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term, especially given the negative Zacks Rank and iPhone sales concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks analyst blog presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the past four quarters, there are significant headwinds.  iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  However, the Services segment is expected to show strong double-digit growth, and Mac sales are anticipated to rise.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong negative indicator.  The article highlights both positive factors (Services growth, Mac sales increase, AI push) and negative factors (China headwinds, iPhone sales decline, delayed Apple Intelligence, stretched valuation).  Considering the mixed signals and the negative Zacks Rank, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term given the already priced-in expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news content provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's Services segment is expected to grow steadily, and the company's focus on AI with the introduction of Apple Intelligence could improve its competitive position. Additionally, Mac sales are expected to rise year-over-year. However, there are significant concerns, including potential declines in iPhone sales due to stiff competition in China, a stretched valuation (as indicated by a Value Score of F and a higher forward P/E ratio compared to the sector), and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation. The stock has also underperformed the sector recently. Given these mixed signals, the near-term stock price movement is uncertain, but the negative factors (especially the Sell recommendation and iPhone sales concerns) may weigh more heavily on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report, expectations for iPhone sales decline, steady growth in Services, and a positive outlook on AI integration. However, concerns about competition in China, delayed launch of Apple Intelligence, and stretched valuation are noted. Apple's stock has underperformed the sector, and the Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report and the potential impact of iPhone sales, Services segment growth, and Mac sales on the company's stock price. The article highlights the challenges Apple faces in China, including stiff competition and a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence. Additionally, the article notes that Apple's valuation is stretched, with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and provides insights into the company's expected revenue and earnings. While there are positive aspects such as the growth in the Services segment and Mac sales, there are also concerns like the underperformance of iPhone sales and a potential headwind from China. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating adds to the negative sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in revenues and services, concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly due to competition in China, and a stretched valuation suggest potential headwinds. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment among analysts. Although there are positive factors such as growth in the Services segment and Mac sales, the overall sentiment leans towards a price decline due to the significant concerns highlighted in the report. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to concerns about iPhone sales decline, competition in China, a stretched valuation, and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). While there are positive aspects like growth in the Services segment and Mac sales, the negative factors seem to outweigh the positives in the short term. The trend in previous predictions shows a consistent bearish sentiment. Therefore, I will maintain a similar outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Services and Mac sales are expected to perform well, concerns about declining iPhone sales in China and a delayed AI launch outweigh the positives.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting a bearish consensus among analysts.  Although Apple's AI push offers long-term potential, the near-term headwinds, coupled with a stretched valuation, increase the likelihood of a price decline.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, reinforcing this assessment.  While the Services segment's growth is a positive factor, it's unlikely to fully offset the negative impact of weakening iPhone sales and the overall bearish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. Positive factors include expected growth in Services and Mac sales, as well as the potential long-term benefits of Apple's AI push. However, significant headwinds such as declining iPhone sales due to competition in China, a stretched valuation, and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation indicate bearish sentiment. The stock has also underperformed the sector recently. Given these mixed signals, but with more weight on the negative factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. While the company's Services segment is expected to grow steadily and Mac sales are anticipated to rise, there are concerns about declining iPhone sales due to competition in China and a stretched valuation. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) and a higher forward P/E ratio compared to the sector also suggest a cautious approach. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems lower than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in revenues and services, concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly due to competition in China, and a stretched valuation suggest potential headwinds. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates a bearish sentiment among analysts. Considering these factors and the trend of others' predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is expected growth in revenues and services, and the company's push towards AI with the launch of Apple Intelligence could present long-term opportunities. On the other hand, iPhone sales are expected to decline due to competition in China and delays in the launch of Apple Intelligence. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and stretched valuation are also negative indicators. Given the balanced nature of the news, with both positive and negative factors, the probability of the stock price moving either way appears to be relatively equal. However, the negative factors and the recent underperformance of the stock relative to the sector might slightly tip the balance towards a higher probability of a price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
