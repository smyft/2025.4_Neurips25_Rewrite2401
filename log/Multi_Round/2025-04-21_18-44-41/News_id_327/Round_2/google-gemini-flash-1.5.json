(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news from UBS suggests a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025, indicating limited exposure to AI revenue growth compared to other companies like Dell and TD SYNNEX, which are favored. The analysts specifically mention that Apple, along with IBM and Pure Storage, is expected to have minimal upside revisions due to its de minimis AI-related revenue. This negative sentiment surrounding Apple's growth prospects in the context of AI could lead to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price decline based on the analysts' recommendations and market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned only in passing, stating that it has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025' and is grouped with IBM and Pure Storage as companies with limited upside revisions. This suggests a slightly negative outlook for Apple, as it implies that Apple may not benefit significantly from the AI boom in the near term. However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple stock or predict a price decline. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal, but slightly negative due to the lack of AI exposure mentioned. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, specifically highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as strong buys for 2025 due to their expected growth in AI-related revenue and overall market recovery.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in passing, as having 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025'. This implies that the news is largely neutral for Apple. While the lack of significant AI revenue might be viewed negatively by some investors, it's not a strong negative indicator given Apple's overall financial strength and diverse product portfolio.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease due to this specific news is relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses UBS's outlook on Dell, TD SYNNEX, IBM, and Pure Storage, with limited direct mention of Apple (AAPL). However, it does note that Apple, along with IBM and Pure Storage, has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' which UBS views as a limiting factor for upside revisions. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech sector and the news indirectly suggests it may not benefit significantly from AI-driven growth in 2025, this could lead to neutral or slightly negative sentiment among investors. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate some of this impact. The lack of direct negative commentary on Apple suggests the effect may be muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content mention UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Specifically, UBS analysts highlight that Apple (AAPL) has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth prospects for the company in the near term. This could lead to a negative perception of Apple's stock, potentially causing it to fall. However, the overall impact might be moderate as the news is more focused on other companies' recommendations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's outlook for the enterprise hardware and networking sector in 2025, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Although Apple is mentioned as having minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, the article does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell Apple shares. However, the mention of limited upside revisions for Apple due to its minimal AI-related revenue/exposure in 2025 suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred stocks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. is only mentioned in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue, which is expected to limit upside revisions. This suggests that the news does not provide specific positive or negative indicators for Apple Inc., leading to an assumption that the impact might be neutral.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report highlights a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating that it has minimal exposure to AI-related revenue growth compared to other companies like Dell and TD SYNNEX, which are favored. The mention of Apple alongside IBM and Pure Storage as having limited upside revisions suggests a negative sentiment towards its growth prospects in the context of the AI boom. While the overall impact on Apple's stock may not be severe, the lack of positive indicators and the focus on other companies lead to a higher probability of a price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. Apple is mentioned only in passing, stating that it has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025' and is grouped with IBM and Pure Storage as companies with limited upside revisions. This suggests a slightly negative outlook for Apple, as it implies that Apple may not benefit significantly from the AI boom in the near term. However, the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple stock or predict a price decline. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal, but slightly negative due to the lack of AI exposure mentioned. Considering the previous predictions, the trend is slightly negative. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on other companies, mentioning Apple only in the context of limited AI revenue exposure in 2025.  This is presented as a factor limiting potential upside, but it's not a strong negative.  Apple's overall financial health and diverse product portfolio are not discussed. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but none strongly suggesting a significant movement.  The lack of specific news about Apple makes a neutral stance most likely.  Considering the previous predictions and the indirect, relatively neutral nature of the news regarding Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the potential for some negative sentiment due to the limited AI exposure mentioned, but acknowledging the overall lack of significant news impacting Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on UBS's recommendations for Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned only in passing, with UBS noting its 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' which suggests limited upside potential due to lack of significant AI-driven growth. This indirect mention implies a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, as the lack of AI exposure could be seen as a drawback in the current market environment. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio may mitigate some of this negative sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the lack of direct negative commentary, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article from UBS provides a sector outlook for enterprise hardware and networking, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage.

However, the article does not provide a direct recommendation to buy or sell Apple shares. Considering the indirect mention and the lack of significant negative commentary, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate.
