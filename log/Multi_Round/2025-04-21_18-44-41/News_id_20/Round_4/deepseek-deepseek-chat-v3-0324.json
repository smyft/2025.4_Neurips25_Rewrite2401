      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech Stocks Rising as DeepSeek Fears Fade\nNews Content: Tech stocks looked set to lead the broader market higher on Friday as a wild week for markets drew to a close. The rapid rise of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model\u2013seemingly made on the cheap\u2013triggered a brutal selloff Monday, but tech stocks have pared back some of their losses since then. Apple CEO Tim Cook said DeepSeek was probably a \"good thing\" on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization has taken a \"prudent\" approach to capital spending.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple being a stable, well-performing company, increases the likelihood of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend for tech stocks in general, with the market recovering from initial fears surrounding DeepSeek. Tim Cook's comments characterizing DeepSeek as potentially a \"good thing\" and emphasizing Apple's \"prudent\" capital spending are reassuring to investors. This suggests stability and confidence in Apple's strategy, which could attract investors and push the stock price higher. While competition from DeepSeek and general market volatility remain potential risks, the overall tone is positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive overall sentiment for tech stocks, with the initial fear surrounding DeepSeek's AI model fading.  Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a prudent approach to capital spending. While the news doesn't directly announce any positive developments for Apple specifically, the broader market positivity and Cook's comments suggest a likely positive impact on Apple's stock price. The fact that the initial selloff has been partially reversed also adds to the optimism. However, there's always inherent market volatility, and external factors could influence the stock price regardless of this news.  Therefore, while a price rise is considered more likely, a certain probability of a fall is also acknowledged.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple, as fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have subsided. Apple's CEO Tim Cook's comments suggest a measured and positive outlook, which could reassure investors. Given the broader market recovery and Cook's optimistic tone, the stock is likely to rise. However, there is still some residual uncertainty from the initial selloff, which could temper gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that tech stocks, including Apple Inc., are recovering from a selloff triggered by concerns about DeepSeek's new AI model. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has made a statement that seems to alleviate fears, mentioning that the company has taken a 'prudent' approach to capital spending. This could be interpreted as a positive sign for investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, the overall impact of the news on Apple's stock price is uncertain, and the market may already have priced in the positive effects of the statement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including Apple, are rising as fears about DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model are fading. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has also made a positive comment about DeepSeek, stating it's probably a 'good thing', which suggests that the company is not overly concerned about the competition. This, combined with the fact that tech stocks have already started to recover from their initial losses, leads me to believe that the stock price of Apple is more likely to rise than fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The provided financial news indicates a recovery trend in tech stocks as fears stemming from DeepSeek's new AI model have diminished. CEO Tim Cook's comments suggesting that DeepSeek could be beneficial reinforce a positive outlook for investors regarding Apple's competitive position. The overall sentiment leans toward optimism with many predictions reflecting a higher probability of rising stock prices given the recovery of tech stocks and Apple's stable financial stance. However, there remains a minor risk of a price fall due to market volatility and residual uncertainty from the initial selloff. Thus, I estimate a probability of 0.68 for a price rise and 0.32 for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price. The headline highlights a recovery in tech stocks as DeepSeek fears subside, and Tim Cook's positive comments further reassure investors. The 'prudent' capital spending message reinforces Apple's stability. Given this, and the trend in previous predictions, I expect a slightly more conservative positive movement. However, market volatility and unforeseen circumstances should not be disregarded, introducing a non-negligible chance of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple. The tech sector is recovering from a DeepSeek-induced selloff, and Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, offered reassuring comments, characterizing DeepSeek as potentially beneficial and highlighting Apple's prudent capital spending.  This suggests confidence and stability. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a stock price rise (most models predicted a probability of 0.6 or higher).  However, it's important to note that this is based on a relatively short-term assessment, external factors could influence the stock price, and any significant market shifts would impact the prediction. The consensus of previous predictions, while not definitive proof, strengthens the probability that the stock will rise. I've adjusted the probability slightly downward compared to some previous predictions, accounting for potential market volatility and the fact that Cook's statement is not explicitly positive news for Apple itself but rather reflects an overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have subsided. Apple's CEO Tim Cook's comments, describing DeepSeek as probably a 'good thing' and emphasizing Apple's 'prudent' approach to capital spending, are reassuring to investors. This suggests stability and confidence in Apple's strategy, which could attract investors and push the stock price higher. The broader market recovery from the initial selloff and the optimistic tone of the news further support the likelihood of a price rise. However, there is still some residual uncertainty from the initial selloff, which could temper gains. Given the consensus among previous predictions and the positive market sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend for tech stocks, including Apple Inc., as fears related to DeepSeek's new AI model have subsided. Apple's CEO Tim Cook characterized DeepSeek as potentially a 'good thing' and highlighted the company's 'prudent' approach to capital spending. This suggests that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI and is managing its investments carefully. The overall market recovery and Cook's optimistic tone imply a likely positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, residual uncertainty from the initial selloff and general market volatility mean there's still a possibility of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. Considering the various predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising, and taking into account the overall positive tone of the news, it seems likely that Apple's stock price will rise. The market's initial reaction to DeepSeek's AI model has been largely priced in, and with tech stocks recovering, Apple is likely to benefit from this trend. However, acknowledging the inherent volatility of the market and potential risks, I have adjusted the probabilities to reflect a slightly more cautious outlook compared to some of the more optimistic predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend for tech stocks as market fears surrounding DeepSeek's AI model have subsided. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek and emphasized Apple's prudent approach to capital spending, which can reassure investors. Most previous predictions show a higher probability of stock price rise, with the majority predicting around 0.7 probability. There is general consensus among different models that Apple's stock is likely to rise due to the market recovery, CEO's positive comments, and the partial reversal of the initial selloff.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks following a selloff triggered by concerns about DeepSeek's AI model, which has now abated. Tim Cook's positive comments suggest that Apple views potential competition from DeepSeek as an opportunity rather than a threat, indicating confidence in Apple's strategic approach. This positive market sentiment, coupled with signs of stability and recovery in the tech sector, points toward a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising. Despite residual uncertainty and market volatility, the overall sentiment among previous predictions supports an optimistic outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.69, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.31, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment shift in the tech sector following initial concerns about DeepSeek's AI model. Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek and emphasis on Apple's prudent capital spending are reassuring to investors. The trend in previous predictions has been consistently leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, market uncertainties and potential unforeseen circumstances always remain. Taking into account the overall positive outlook and the existing prediction trend, I'm maintaining a similar positive sentiment but with a slight moderation to account for unforeseen factors. The previous predictions ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 for stock price rise, with a slight downward adjustment in the last round, so my estimate is based on a balanced view of these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple. The overall recovery of the tech sector after initial DeepSeek-related fears, coupled with Tim Cook's reassuring comments about DeepSeek and Apple's prudent spending, paints a picture of stability and potential growth.  The consensus among previous prediction models also strongly favors a price rise. While market volatility is always a factor and there's inherent uncertainty in any prediction, the information points strongly toward an increase in Apple's stock price.  I've slightly lowered the probability of a rise compared to some previous predictions to account for the always-present possibility of unforeseen events or market corrections, but the overall trend remains bullish.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

Most previous predictions show a higher probability of stock price rise, with the majority predicting around 0.7 probability. There is general consensus among different models that Apple's stock is likely to rise due to the market recovery, CEO's positive comments, and the partial reversal of the initial selloff. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the consensus among previous predictions, it seems likely that Apple's stock price will rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued positive trend for tech stocks as fears surrounding DeepSeek's AI model have subsided. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, expressed a positive view towards DeepSeek and emphasized Apple's prudent approach to capital spending, which can reassure investors. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently show a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising, supported by the market recovery and CEO's positive comments. Although there is some inherent market volatility, the overall sentiment strongly favors a stock price rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a recovery trend in tech stocks, particularly Apple, as fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments indicate a reassuring outlook and a prudent approach to capital spending, which likely boosts investor confidence. The previous predictions have shown a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, reflecting an overall positive sentiment in the market despite residual uncertainties from prior selloffs. Thus, I estimate a higher probability for a price increase. However, it is important to acknowledge potential market volatility which keeps the prediction of a price fall plausible.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovering tech sector with reduced fears of DeepSeek impacting market sentiment positively. Tim Cook's optimistic comments reinforce the idea that Apple is well-positioned to navigate potential competitive pressures. Prior predictions consistently lean towards a stock price increase, though slight adjustments are made to account for general market volatility. Given the prevailing positive sentiment and previous rounds' consensus, a rise is anticipated, but tempered by inherent market risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for Apple. The tech sector rebound following the DeepSeek-related sell-off, combined with Tim Cook's reassuring comments about DeepSeek and Apple's prudent spending, suggests stability and potential growth.  The consensus among the previous predictions consistently favors a stock price increase.  While acknowledging inherent market volatility and potential unforeseen circumstances,  the overall sentiment remains bullish.  The slight downward trend in predicted probabilities of price increase across rounds indicates a cautious adjustment reflecting the uncertainty inherent in stock market predictions. While there is a chance for a price fall, the consistent positive sentiment and lack of any negative news related specifically to Apple points to a higher probability of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend for tech stocks, including Apple Inc., as fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have subsided.
