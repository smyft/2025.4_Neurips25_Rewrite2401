(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech Stocks Rising as DeepSeek Fears Fade\nNews Content: Tech stocks looked set to lead the broader market higher on Friday as a wild week for markets drew to a close. The rapid rise of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model\u2013seemingly made on the cheap\u2013triggered a brutal selloff Monday, but tech stocks have pared back some of their losses since then. Apple CEO Tim Cook said DeepSeek was probably a \"good thing\" on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization has taken a \"prudent\" approach to capital spending.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has made a statement that seems to alleviate fears, mentioning that the company has taken a 'prudent' approach to capital spending. This could be interpreted as a positive sign for investors, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, the overall impact of the news on Apple's stock price is uncertain, and the market may already have priced in the positive effects of the statement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tech Stocks Rising as DeepSeek Fears Fade\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n\nIn this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is 60% (0.6), while the probability of it falling is 40% (0.4). The news seems to be neutral to slightly positive for Apple, as it suggests that the company is not overly concerned about the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on its business. However, the market's reaction is always unpredictable, and there are various factors that could influence the stock price movement."
