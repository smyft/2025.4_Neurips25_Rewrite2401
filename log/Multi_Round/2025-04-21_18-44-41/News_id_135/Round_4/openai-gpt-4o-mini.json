(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

(AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current price of $223. This suggests a potential for price appreciation. Additionally, the analysis highlights that annual earnings are forecast to grow over the next three years, which could further support a rise in stock price. However, there are also noted weaknesses, such as declining earnings over the past year and a low dividend compared to peers, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the positive valuation and growth outlook outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a 20% undervaluation of Apple's stock based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis. While DCF models have limitations and rely on assumptions, the article highlights a potential opportunity. The article also mentions analyst price targets being higher than the current price, further supporting a potential price increase. However, the article also points out risks and weaknesses, such as declining earnings and slower growth compared to the overall American market. The SWOT analysis presents a mixed picture. Considering the undervaluation claim, analyst targets, and the general positive sentiment around Apple, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the identified risks and weaknesses prevent assigning a very high probability. The article also emphasizes that valuation is just one aspect and not a foolproof method, suggesting caution.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by approximately 20%, with a fair value estimate of US$279 compared to the current price of US$223.  However, the DCF model relies on several assumptions, including future cash flow projections and discount rates, which inherently involve uncertainty.  While the analysis points towards potential upside, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of DCF models.  The article itself highlights the imprecise nature of valuation and cautions against solely relying on this method.  Furthermore, the analysis doesn't incorporate other market factors or potential negative news that could impact the stock price. Therefore, assigning a high probability to a price rise solely based on this analysis would be premature. A more balanced approach considers both the potential upside and the inherent risks and uncertainties involved.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. The DCF model, while not flawless, is a widely respected valuation method. The article also notes that Apple's fair value estimate is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246, indicating potential upside. Given the positive valuation gap and the general market tendency to correct undervaluation over time, there is a reasonable probability that the stock price could rise. However, the DCF model's assumptions (e.g., growth rates, discount rate) are subject to uncertainty, and external factors (e.g., market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions) could also influence the stock price. The article does not highlight any immediate negative catalysts, so the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, with an estimated fair value of $279. The article highlights that this valuation is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246. The DCF model takes into account the company's future cash flows and discounts them back to today's value. The analysis also presents a SWOT analysis, noting strengths such as debt being well-covered by earnings and cash flows, and opportunities like annual earnings forecasted to grow for the next 3 years. However, it also mentions weaknesses and threats, including earnings decline over the past year and forecasted slower annual earnings growth compared to the American market. Given the positive valuation analysis and growth opportunities, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc.'s stock is undervalued by 20% based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model estimates the company's fair value to be $279, which is higher than the current stock price of $223. The article also mentions that the company's earnings are forecasted to grow for the next 3 years, and the dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market. However, the article also notes that the company's earnings declined over the past year and the annual earnings are forecasted to grow slower than the American market. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by approximately 20% based on a DCF model estimating its fair value at $279 per share compared to its current share price of $223. This undervaluation could potentially attract investors, thereby increasing demand and driving the stock price upwards. Additionally, the company shows strength in covering debt with earnings and cashflows, and opportunities for growth in the next three years, which further supports the positive outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc.

The fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current price of $223 suggests potential upside. While the article acknowledges weaknesses like declining earnings and slower growth compared to the market, the overall sentiment is positive. Considering the consistent predictions in previous rounds, I will slightly increase the probability of a price rise, but not excessively, given the inherent uncertainties in valuation models and market conditions. The SWOT analysis also presents a mixed picture, which warrants a degree of caution.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a DCF analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%, with a fair value of $279 compared to the current price of $223.  This is a significant potential upside. However, the DCF model's inherent limitations, reliance on assumptions (future cash flows, discount rate), and the absence of other market factors or potential negative news must be considered.  The previous predictions range from 0.6 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, reflecting a similar cautious optimism. While the undervaluation is compelling, the inherent uncertainties in any valuation model, especially a DCF, prevent assigning an extremely high probability to a price rise.  The article itself stresses the imprecise nature of valuation.  Considering the consensus of previous models and the inherent risks, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the possibility of a price fall due to unforeseen circumstances or market corrections.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.

The forecasted earnings growth over the next three years further supports this. However, the weaknesses (declining earnings last year, slower growth than the market) and the inherent limitations of DCF models temper the optimism. Previous rounds consistently predicted a higher probability of a price rise, generally around 0.65-0.72. Given this trend and the continued undervaluation signal, I'll maintain a similar stance, but slightly adjust downwards to account for the mentioned weaknesses and the general market uncertainty. The fact that the analyst target is lower than the DCF fair value also suggests some caution.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a DCF analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%, with a fair value of $279 compared to the current price of $223.

However, weaknesses and threats, including earnings decline over the past year and forecasted slower annual earnings growth compared to the American market, introduce uncertainty. Considering the DCF model's limitations and the mixed picture presented by the SWOT analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, but not excessively high due to the uncertainties and risks involved. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, ranging from 0.6 to 0.72, which supports a moderate optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc.
