(AAPL), and the statement from the EU's Competition Chief Ribera that these fines are 'not a tax'. This statement suggests that the EU is committed to enforcing antitrust laws and protecting consumers, which could potentially lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and fines for Apple. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's current or future business operations, financial performance, or any potential impact on the company's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's stock price, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are likely to be relatively low.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}"
