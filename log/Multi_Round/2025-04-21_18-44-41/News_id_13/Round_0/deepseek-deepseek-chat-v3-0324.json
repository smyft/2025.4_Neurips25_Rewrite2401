(AAPL). The EU's enforcement of antitrust regulations could lead to potential fines or stricter regulations for Apple, which may negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the news does not indicate any immediate action or specific fines against Apple, so the impact may be limited. The probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher due to the potential for future regulatory challenges, but the probability of a rise is not significantly affected as the news is more about general regulatory sentiment rather than direct action.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
