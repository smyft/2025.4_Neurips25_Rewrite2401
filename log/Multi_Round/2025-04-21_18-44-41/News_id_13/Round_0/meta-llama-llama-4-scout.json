However, the content does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or any direct actions against it. The statement from the EU Competition Chief, Margrethe Vestager, known as Ribera in some regions, emphasizes the EU's commitment to enforcing antitrust laws to protect consumers, which is a neutral to slightly negative stance for tech giants like Apple that operate in the EU. Given that this news does not contain a direct negative impact on Apple and considering the current regulatory environment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is slightly skewed towards a negative impact due to the general regulatory headwinds, but not significantly so as the news is not directly targeted at Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
