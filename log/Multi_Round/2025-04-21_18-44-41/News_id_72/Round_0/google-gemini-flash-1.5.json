(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer as iPhone Sales Slow, China Market Shrinks\nNews Content: Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Oppenheimer's downgrade from \\\"Outperform\\\" to \\\"Perform\\\", coupled with lowered price targets and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, strongly suggests a negative outlook for Apple.  The news highlights significant concerns: slowing iPhone sales, particularly a sharp decline in the crucial Chinese market, and increasing competition from Android manufacturers.  While the EBITDA margin increased, this positive factor is overshadowed by the substantial negative projections for revenue and EPS. The market's immediate reaction (1.5% drop) reflects this negative sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise in the short to medium term, although longer-term prospects remain uncertain and depend on Apple's ability to address these challenges.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer as iPhone Sales Slow, China Market Shrinks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.8\n}\n```\n"
