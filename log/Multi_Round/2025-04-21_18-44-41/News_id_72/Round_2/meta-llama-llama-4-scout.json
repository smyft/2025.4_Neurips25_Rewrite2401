      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer as iPhone Sales Slow, China Market Shrinks\nNews Content: Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock, primarily due to weaker iPhone sales and increased competition in China. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts further supports a bearish sentiment. The immediate market reaction, with a 1.5% drop in share value, suggests that investors are responding negatively to the news. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with lowered price target and revenue forecasts, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term growth. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce the bearish outlook. While EBITDA margin climbed, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", coupled with lowered price targets and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, strongly suggests a negative outlook for Apple.  The news highlights significant concerns: slowing iPhone sales, particularly a sharp decline in the crucial Chinese market, and increasing competition from Android manufacturers.  While the EBITDA margin increased, this positive factor is overshadowed by the substantial negative projections for revenue and EPS. The market's immediate reaction (1.5% drop) reflects this negative sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise in the short to medium term, although longer-term prospects remain uncertain and depend on Apple's ability to address these challenges.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker long-term prospects, slower iPhone sales, and increasing competition in China. The firm also reduced its price target and lowered EPS and revenue forecasts. Additionally, Apple's market share in China has significantly declined, with iPhone shipments dropping by 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024. These factors suggest significant headwinds for Apple's stock price in the short to medium term. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales projections, increased competition in China, and a decline in market share. The firm's price target for Apple was also lowered, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut. Given these negative revisions and concerns about Apple's future growth prospects, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China. The firm has cut its price target and revenue forecast for Apple, citing a slowdown in iPhone demand and a drop in market share in China. This negative news is likely to have a downward impact on the stock price. However, it's worth noting that the EBITDA margin has climbed year on year, which could be a positive factor. Overall, the negative factors seem to outweigh the positive ones, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the reduction in revenue forecasts indicate negative sentiment towards the company's future performance, particularly concerning iPhone sales and market share in China. These factors are likely to have a significant negative impact on investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. However, the increase in EBITDA margin suggests some positive financial performance, which might slightly mitigate the negative impact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, coupled with lowered price targets and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, indicates a negative outlook for Apple. The significant decline in iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and the increased competition from local manufacturers further exacerbate concerns about Apple's future growth. Although the EBITDA margin has improved, it does not outweigh the negative sentiment stemming from the downgrade and the overall bearish projections. The immediate market reaction, with a 1.5% drop in share value, reflects this negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is overwhelmingly bearish, with all models predicting a high probability of the stock price falling. This is driven by the Oppenheimer downgrade, lowered price target, reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, and significant concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in China. The negative sentiment is further reinforced by the reported drop in iPhone shipments and market share in China. While the EBITDA margin increase is a positive factor, it is overshadowed by the numerous negative indicators. Given the consistent bearish outlook across multiple models and the lack of any significant positive counter-arguments, I will maintain a similar prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  Oppenheimer's downgrade, reduced price target, lowered revenue and EPS forecasts, and the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China all point towards a bearish outlook.  While the EBITDA margin increase is a positive, it's overshadowed by the substantial concerns regarding revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share price reflects the immediate negative investor sentiment.  The consensus among previous models also leans heavily towards a price fall.  Considering all these factors, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although some upward movement is possible due to the EBITDA margin increase and potential for Apple to address the challenges.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker long-term prospects, slower iPhone sales, and increasing competition in China. The firm also reduced its price target and lowered EPS and revenue forecasts. Apple's market share in China has declined sharply, with iPhone shipments dropping by 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is bearish. The immediate market reaction, with a 1.5% drop in share value, further supports a negative outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales projections, increased competition in China, and a decline in market share. The firm has cut its price target and revenue forecast for Apple, citing a slowdown in iPhone demand and a drop in market share in China. This negative news is likely to have a downward impact on the stock price. The consensus from multiple models is that the negative factors, such as the downgrade, lowered EPS estimates, and declining market share in China, outweigh any positive factors like the increase in EBITDA margin. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China.

These factors have led to lower revenue forecasts, reduced EPS estimates, and a more cautious outlook for Apple's near-term growth. While the EBITDA margin has improved, it is overshadowed by the broader negative sentiment. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a bearish outlook, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Given the consistent negative sentiment and the substantial concerns raised by the news, the probability of the stock price falling remains high.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
