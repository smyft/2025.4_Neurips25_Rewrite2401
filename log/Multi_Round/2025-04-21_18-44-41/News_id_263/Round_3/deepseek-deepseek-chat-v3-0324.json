(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok creates uncertainty in the social media landscape, potentially benefiting competitors like Meta and YouTube. This could lead to a shift in advertising revenue away from TikTok, which may positively impact companies like Apple that host competing apps. However, the uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the ban and potential executive actions by President-elect Trump could create volatility. Overall, while there is potential for increased revenue for Apple through its app ecosystem, the immediate impact of regulatory uncertainty may lead to cautious investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban and its potential impact on Apple (AAPL) is complex and presents both positive and negative aspects. On the negative side, the article mentions that Apple could face penalties for allowing users to download TikTok from its app store if the ban goes into effect. This could create a legal dilemma and potentially lead to negative publicity. However, the article also suggests that Trump might delay or overturn the ban, creating uncertainty. On the positive side, the article focuses more on the potential benefits for Meta and YouTube, with no direct positive impact on Apple. Given the uncertainty and the potential for negative consequences, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The overall impact on Apple is likely to be minimal compared to the impact on ByteDance, Meta, and Google.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok creates uncertainty for Apple.  The article highlights that if the ban goes into effect, Apple will be legally obligated to remove TikTok from its App Store, facing significant penalties for non-compliance.  While President-elect Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement introduces uncertainty, the risk of legal challenges and the potential for the ban to proceed remain.  The potential loss of TikTok from the App Store could negatively impact Apple's revenue, particularly in terms of app downloads and in-app purchases.  However, the impact is likely to be relatively small compared to Apple's overall business.  The uncertainty itself could cause some short-term market volatility, but the long-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited given the company's diverse revenue streams.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is expected to be relatively small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the Supreme Court upholding a US law that bans TikTok unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary. This ruling could benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) indirectly by potentially reducing competition in the app ecosystem and shifting user engagement to other platforms, which might increase demand for Apple's services. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal, as the primary beneficiaries are social media rivals like Meta (META) and YouTube. The uncertainty around TikTok's future and potential executive actions by Trump add complexity, but overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok losing its Supreme Court battle to stop a US ban has implications for Apple's stock price, primarily due to the potential impact on the app stores of companies like Apple and Google. If TikTok is banned or sold, it may set a precedent for other apps, potentially affecting Apple's business. However, the direct impact on Apple seems limited as TikTok's ban is more related to national security concerns and data collection practices rather than a direct criticism of Apple's operations. The news might have a slightly positive effect if advertising dollars shift from TikTok to other platforms, potentially benefiting Meta and YouTube, but this is more indirect for Apple. Given the information, the probabilities are estimated based on the indirect and precedent-setting implications for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications on the social media landscape could have a positive effect on Apple's stock price, as it may lead to increased usage and advertising revenue for Apple's own services and platforms. Additionally, the potential ban on TikTok could lead to a shift in user attention to other social media platforms, such as Instagram, which could also benefit Apple. However, the news does not have a direct impact on Apple's core business, and the company's stock price is likely to be influenced by a variety of factors beyond this single news event. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential shift in advertisement spending towards competitors of TikTok, such as Meta (META) and YouTube, if TikTok faces a ban. As Apple (AAPL) does not directly compete with TikTok in the same market space, the news might not have a direct negative impact on AAPL. However, it could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards growth and tech stocks in general. The overall market reaction and specific investor behavior will determine the exact impact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok introduces significant uncertainty in the social media landscape, which could indirectly benefit Apple by reducing competition in the app ecosystem. However, the potential legal implications for Apple regarding the enforcement of the ban create a cautious sentiment among investors. While there is a possibility of increased advertising revenue shifting to platforms like Meta and YouTube, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Overall, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of potential benefits and risks, with a slight inclination towards a stock price rise due to the indirect advantages.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Apple faces potential penalties for hosting TikTok if the ban goes into effect, creating a legal and reputational risk. On the other hand, the article primarily focuses on the benefits for Meta and YouTube, with limited direct positive impact on Apple. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's potential intervention adds another layer of complexity. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight downward trend in the predicted probability of a stock price rise. Given the potential negative consequences and the indirect benefits, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, but not drastically so, as Apple's overall business is diversified.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the direct impact on Apple is limited, the indirect consequences are significant.  The potential for increased advertising revenue for competitors like Meta and YouTube is highlighted, suggesting a possible shift in the digital advertising market.  However, Apple faces potential penalties for non-compliance with the ban, creating legal uncertainty.  The President-elect's potential intervention adds further uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight increase in Apple's stock price due to indirect benefits, while others predict a slight decrease due to the legal risks and uncertainty. Considering the overall uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative impacts, a neutral stance is most appropriate. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the potential for indirect benefits outweighing the direct risks in the short term, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok creates a complex scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the ban could lead to a shift in advertising revenue towards platforms like Meta and YouTube, which might indirectly benefit Apple's ecosystem as users migrate to other apps. On the other hand, Apple could face legal and operational challenges if it is required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially leading to penalties and negative publicity. The uncertainty surrounding President-elect Trump's potential executive actions adds another layer of complexity. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams and the indirect nature of the impact, the overall effect on its stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive.

While the ban may lead to some increased activity on these platforms, it doesn't directly affect Apple's core business operations. However, there is potential for increased scrutiny and regulation impacting the broader tech sector, which could create a cautious investor sentiment.
