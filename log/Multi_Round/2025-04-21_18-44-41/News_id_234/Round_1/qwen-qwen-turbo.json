(AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. following Trump's comments may have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, TikTok's return could be seen as a positive for the digital advertising market, which may indirectly benefit Apple through increased app usage and potential revenue from its App Store. However, the ongoing political and regulatory scrutiny surrounding TikTok could create uncertainty in the tech sector, which may negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given these factors, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the potential positive impact on app engagement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple. The potential ban of TikTok in the US would have created uncertainty and potentially negatively impacted the app ecosystem on iOS devices. The reversal of the ban, even temporarily, removes this uncertainty. While Apple doesn't directly own TikTok, a thriving app ecosystem is beneficial for its platform and user engagement. The news also suggests a potential deal to keep TikTok in the US, which is a positive long-term outlook. However, the situation is still fluid and dependent on future negotiations and executive orders. The mention of Trump's Truth Social (DJT) is irrelevant to Apple's stock. Given the positive, albeit temporary, resolution, a slight positive movement is expected. The probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so due to the uncertainty of the long-term solution.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple's connection to this event is indirect and tenuous.  While TikTok is a popular app, and Apple's App Store hosts it, the impact on Apple's stock price from this specific event is likely to be minimal. The news focuses on political and legal maneuvering rather than any direct financial impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement (either up or down) due to this news is low. Any minor fluctuations would likely be due to broader market trends rather than this specific event.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a temporary resolution to the TikTok ban issue in the United States, with President-elect Donald Trump extending the deadline for a potential ban. This development reduces immediate uncertainty for TikTok's operations in the U.S., which could indirectly benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TikTok is a popular app on the App Store. A stable TikTok presence may sustain or increase app-related revenue for Apple. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be marginal since the news is more directly relevant to TikTok and its parent company ByteDance. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to reduced regulatory risk for a major app on Apple's platform.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after a shutdown, influenced by comments from President-elect Donald Trump, has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as there is no clear connection mentioned between TikTok's operations and Apple's business. However, given that TikTok's situation could influence broader tech sentiment and considering that Apple's business operations and stock performance are not directly tied to the fortunes or misfortunes of TikTok, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive due to overall market sentiment and Trump's comments on business and tech regulation. The shutdown and subsequent return of TikTok could imply regulatory shifts or market dynamics but do not directly influence Apple's core business operations or stock performance in a significant way.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the United States, following comments from President-elect Donald Trump. Although the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it can be inferred that the news may have an indirect impact on the company. As a major player in the technology industry, Apple's stock price may be influenced by developments in the social media and online services sector. The restoration of TikTok services may lead to increased competition for Apple's own services, potentially affecting its stock price. However, the impact is likely to be minimal, and the probability of a significant stock price movement is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that TikTok, a popular social media platform, will be allowed to continue operating in the U.S. This decision comes after a brief shutdown due to national security concerns. Since TikTok competes with other social media platforms, including those owned by Apple (such as FaceTime and iMessage), the restoration of TikTok could potentially reduce usage of Apple's own services. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be minimal, given that these platforms cater to different user needs and demographics.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
