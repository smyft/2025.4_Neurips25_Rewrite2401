(AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. following Trump's comments may have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, TikTok's return could be seen as a positive for the digital advertising market, which may indirectly benefit Apple through increased app usage and potential revenue from its App Store. However, the ongoing political and regulatory scrutiny surrounding TikTok could create uncertainty in the tech sector, which may negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given these factors, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the potential positive impact on app engagement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple. The potential ban of TikTok in the US would have created uncertainty and potentially negatively impacted the app ecosystem on iOS devices. The reversal of the ban, even temporarily, removes this uncertainty. While Apple doesn't directly own TikTok, a thriving app ecosystem is beneficial for its platform and user engagement. The news also suggests a potential deal to keep TikTok in the US, which is a positive long-term outlook. However, the situation is still fluid and dependent on future negotiations and executive orders. The mention of Trump's Truth Social (DJT) is irrelevant to Apple's stock. Given the positive, albeit temporary, resolution, a slight positive movement is expected. The probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so due to the uncertainty of the long-term solution.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple's connection to this event is indirect and tenuous.  While TikTok is a popular app, and Apple's App Store hosts it, the impact on Apple's stock price from this specific event is likely to be minimal. The news focuses on political and legal maneuvering rather than any direct financial impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement (either up or down) due to this news is low. Any minor fluctuations would likely be due to broader market trends rather than this specific event.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a temporary resolution to the TikTok ban issue in the United States, with President-elect Donald Trump extending the deadline for a potential ban. This development reduces immediate uncertainty for TikTok's operations in the U.S., which could indirectly benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) as TikTok is a popular app on the App Store. A stable TikTok presence may sustain or increase app-related revenue for Apple. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be marginal since the news is more directly relevant to TikTok and its parent company ByteDance. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to reduced regulatory risk for a major app on Apple's platform.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after a shutdown, influenced by comments from President-elect Donald Trump, has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as there is no clear connection mentioned between TikTok's operations and Apple's business. However, given that TikTok's situation could influence broader tech sentiment and considering that Apple's business operations and stock performance are not directly tied to the fortunes or misfortunes of TikTok, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive due to overall market sentiment and Trump's comments on business and tech regulation. The shutdown and subsequent return of TikTok could imply regulatory shifts or market dynamics but do not directly influence Apple's core business operations or stock performance in a significant way.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the United States, following comments from President-elect Donald Trump. Although the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it can be inferred that the news may have an indirect impact on the company. As a major player in the technology industry, Apple's stock price may be influenced by developments in the social media and online services sector. The restoration of TikTok services may lead to increased competition for Apple's own services, potentially affecting its stock price. However, the impact is likely to be minimal, and the probability of a significant stock price movement is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that TikTok, a popular social media platform, will be allowed to continue operating in the U.S. This decision comes after a brief shutdown due to national security concerns. Since TikTok competes with other social media platforms, including those owned by Apple (such as FaceTime and iMessage), the restoration of TikTok could potentially reduce usage of Apple's own services. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be minimal, given that these platforms cater to different user needs and demographics.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. following President Trump's comments suggests a temporary alleviation of regulatory concerns that could indirectly benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) through increased app engagement and revenue from its App Store. While the direct impact on Apple's stock is likely minimal, the overall sentiment in the tech sector may improve, leading to a slight positive outlook for Apple. However, the uncertainty surrounding future regulations and the competitive landscape remains, which tempers the optimism. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, with a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's return to operation in the US after a brief shutdown is a slightly positive development for the overall app ecosystem. While Apple doesn't directly benefit financially from TikTok's success, a healthy and diverse app market on iOS is generally favorable. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, reflecting the indirect nature of the impact. Considering the temporary nature of the reprieve and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding TikTok's long-term future in the US, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, but not significantly so. The previous rounds show a slight tendency towards a positive impact, which I will take into account.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration has a very indirect and likely minimal impact on Apple's stock price.  While TikTok operates on Apple's iOS platform, the relationship is not strong enough to cause significant stock movement. The previous predictions are varied, reflecting the weak connection.  The positive aspect is the removal of uncertainty surrounding a major app; however, this is likely already priced into the market.  The negative aspect is the potential for increased competition in the broader digital ecosystem, but this is also a long-term concern, not directly tied to this specific event.  Given the overall weak correlation and the mixed predictions from other models, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of no significant change, with a very slight bias towards a potential minor rise due to the removal of immediate regulatory uncertainty.  The probabilities are weighted to reflect this nuanced situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the U.S., which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). While TikTok is a major app on Apple's App Store, the impact of this specific event on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news does not indicate any direct financial or operational impact on Apple. However, the broader implications of regulatory decisions on tech companies could subtly influence investor sentiment. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, as a major player in the tech industry, Apple's stock price may be indirectly influenced by the developments surrounding TikTok. The restoration of TikTok services removes uncertainty and potential regulatory risk for Apple, which could be seen as a slightly positive factor. Given that TikTok operates on Apple's App Store and other platforms, a stable and operational TikTok could contribute to a healthier app ecosystem, which might indirectly benefit Apple. The impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive due to the overall positive environment for tech companies and app developers. The probabilities reflect a cautious optimism due to the potential for sustained app engagement and revenue streams.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. following Trump's comments has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the return of TikTok could positively impact the digital advertising market and indirectly benefit Apple through increased app usage and potential revenue from its App Store, the ongoing regulatory scrutiny surrounding TikTok may create uncertainty in the tech sector.

Considering the balanced views from various models and the indirect connection between TikTok's situation and Apple's business, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the potential positive impact on app engagement and reduced regulatory risk for major apps on Apple's platform.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news regarding TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. after initial shutdown due to national security concerns and subsequent Trump's decision to extend the ban deadline provides mixed signals. On one hand, Apple Inc. (AAPL) might benefit if TikTok's presence increases the overall app ecosystem health, as increased usage could indirectly benefit the App Store and digital advertising. On the other hand, a thriving TikTok could also increase competition for Apple's own services such as FaceTime and iMessage, potentially impacting their usage negatively. Considering the previous predictions, there's a moderate consensus that the impact on Apple's stock price should be relatively balanced but slightly positive or neutral. The overall market sentiment and Trump's regulatory stance might provide additional uplift.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. following President Trump's comments suggests a temporary alleviation of regulatory concerns that could indirectly benefit Apple Inc.

While Apple doesn't directly profit from TikTok's success, a healthy and diverse app market on iOS is generally favorable. The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight tendency towards a positive impact.

The previous rounds show a slight tendency towards a positive impact, which I will take into account. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the mixed opinions from previous models, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of no significant change, with a very slight bias towards a potential minor rise due to the removal of immediate regulatory uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration has a very weak direct impact on Apple's stock price.  While TikTok uses Apple's platform, the connection is too tenuous to cause significant stock movement. The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting this weak connection. The positive is the removal of near-term uncertainty; however, this is likely already priced into the market.  The negative is the potential for increased competition in the broader digital ecosystem, but this is a long-term concern, not directly tied to this specific event.  Given the overall weak correlation and the mixed predictions from other models, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of no significant change, with a very slight bias towards a potential minor rise due to the removal of immediate regulatory uncertainty.

(AAPL). While TikTok is a popular app on Apple's App Store, the direct financial or operational impact on Apple is negligible.
