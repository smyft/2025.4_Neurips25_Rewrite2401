This suggests a strategic shift in Apple's financial services partnerships, which could be viewed positively by investors if it leads to better terms, enhanced services, or reduced risks associated with Goldman Sachs. However, the market's reaction may depend on the perceived stability and benefits of the new partnership. Given Apple's strong brand and the potential for improved financial services, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.
