      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Jumps 3.5% in Following Strong Quarterly Results\nNews Content: On Friday, The stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The positive premarket increase of 3.5% indicates strong investor reaction to Apple's quarterly results, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates. The outlook for growth in fiscal second-quarter sales suggests strengthening demand for iPhones, despite a slight decrease in sales. Additionally, the services division showed significant growth, further supporting the positive sentiment. Although there was a drop in iPhone sales compared to last year, the overall earnings beat and optimistic future projections outweigh potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities favor a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the initial market reaction was negative, the stock rebounded with a 3.5% premarket jump, indicating positive sentiment following a more thorough analysis of the results. The company beat overall revenue and earnings estimates, and its future sales growth projections are positive. The growth in the services division further contributes to this optimism. However, iPhone sales declined slightly and missed analyst expectations, which poses a risk. The cautious approach to AI investments could be viewed as both a strength (indicating fiscal prudence) and a weakness (potentially missing out on AI-driven growth opportunities). Balancing these factors, the positive elements appear to outweigh the negative, leading to a slightly increased probability of a stock price rise in the short term. Analyst commentary also suggests positive, future performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock jumped 3.5% pre-market following the release of its quarterly earnings. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the overall results exceeded analyst predictions in revenue and earnings per share.  The positive outlook for the next quarter, particularly the prediction of single-digit to mid-single-digit sales growth, is encouraging. The strong performance of the services division also contributes to a positive outlook. Although concerns exist about Apple's cautious approach to AI investments, the company's relatively strong performance amidst recent market volatility suggests resilience.  The initial positive market reaction suggests a high likelihood of continued upward momentum in the short term. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding future AI investments introduce some risk of a price correction.  The probabilities reflect a weighting of these factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive premarket increase of 3.5% for Apple's stock following better-than-expected quarterly results. Despite a slight decrease in iPhone sales, the company's services division outperformed forecasts, and the overall revenue and earnings per share surpassed analyst expectations. Additionally, the company provided a positive outlook for future sales growth, which is likely to instill investor confidence. The cautious approach to AI investments is seen as a protective measure rather than a negative, especially in volatile markets. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported strong quarterly results, beating earnings and revenue projections. The company's services division showed significant growth with a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, exceeding forecasted revenue. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's optimistic outlook for its fiscal second-quarter sales, predicting growth in the single digits to mid-range single digits, suggests a positive trend. Additionally, Apple's cautious approach to AI investments and its resilience during recent market volatility are seen as protective factors for its stock performance. Given these factors, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive increase in Apple's stock price following the release of strong quarterly results, which exceeded analyst predictions. The company's revenue and earnings per share surpassed expectations, and the services division showed significant growth. Although iPhone sales declined slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth and its cautious approach to AI investments suggest a positive trend. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates strong quarterly results and better-than-expected guidance for future sales, suggesting a positive outlook. Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales, the overall revenue and services division's performance have exceeded expectations. This has led to an immediate 3.5% increase in the stock price, reflecting investor confidence. Given these factors, there is a high likelihood of continued upward momentum in the near term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news presents a strong overall picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a notable premarket increase of 3.5% following better-than-expected quarterly results regarding earnings and revenue. Although there was a slight decline in iPhone sales compared to analyst expectations, the overall performance exceeded forecasts and the growth in the services division is a positive indicator. The company's projection of future sales growth in the second quarter also supports an optimistic outlook. Despite concerns about the cautious approach to AI investments, the prevailing sentiment remains positive due to strong earnings and robust future guidance, which suggests a high likelihood of continued upward momentum.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from previous predictions leans heavily towards a stock price increase for Apple. The initial premarket jump of 3.5% reflects investor optimism following the quarterly results, even considering the slight dip in iPhone sales. The earnings beat and revenue exceeding projections, coupled with a positive outlook, reinforce this sentiment. Furthermore, the strong performance from the services division provides an additional boost. Apple's cautious AI approach seems to be well-received, adding to its stability. The consensus from prior rounds is a strong indicator, suggesting the bullish trend is likely to continue.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results show a mixed bag. While the company beat revenue and EPS expectations, iPhone sales were slightly below projections.  However, the services division significantly outperformed expectations, and the positive outlook for Q2 sales growth is encouraging.  The 3.5% pre-market jump reflects immediate positive market sentiment. Previous model predictions overwhelmingly favored a price rise (averaging around 0.7), although some acknowledged risks associated with slightly lower iPhone sales and a cautious AI strategy. The consensus view correctly interprets the overall positive tone despite some minor negatives.  While the slightly lower than expected iPhone sales could lead to some short-term correction, the positive outlook, strong services revenue growth, and the existing positive market reaction suggest the upward momentum is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than the average of the previous models to account for the strong pre-market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong quarterly results, with earnings and revenue surpassing analyst expectations, leading to a 3.5% premarket increase in stock price. The positive outlook for future sales growth, particularly in the iPhone market, and the significant growth in the services division further bolster investor confidence. Although there was a slight decline in iPhone sales, the overall performance and optimistic projections outweigh this negative aspect. The cautious approach to AI investments is viewed as a protective measure rather than a drawback. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news reports that Apple's stock price jumped 3.5% pre-market following strong quarterly results. Despite a slight decrease in iPhone sales, the company's overall revenue and earnings per share surpassed analyst expectations. The services division showed significant growth, and the company provided a positive outlook for future sales growth, predicting single-digit to mid-single-digit growth. The cautious approach to AI investments is seen as a protective measure rather than a negative. Given these factors, the positive elements appear to outweigh the negative, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a strong quarterly performance by Apple Inc., with exceeded earnings and revenue expectations, despite a slight decline in iPhone sales. The services division showed significant growth, and the company's outlook for future sales is positive. The initial market reaction was a 3.5% premarket increase, suggesting investor confidence. Considering the overall positive trends and the resilience of Apple's stock during recent market volatility, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. The cautious approach to AI investments is viewed as a protective measure rather than a negative. The previous predictions from various models also suggest a high likelihood of the stock price rising, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. Therefore, a balanced estimation considering all factors is provided.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights strong quarterly results and better-than-expected guidance for future sales, suggesting a positive outlook. Apple's overall revenue and earnings per share surpassed analyst predictions, and the services division performed well. While iPhone sales were slightly lower than expected, the company's cautious approach to AI investments and resilience during market volatility are viewed positively. The initial 3.5% premarket increase further confirms investor confidence. These aspects collectively support a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.76, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.24, Reasoning: Apple's stock has shown a significant positive response, rising 3.5% in premarket trading following strong quarterly results that exceeded both earnings and revenue expectations. Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales, the overall results and a positive outlook for future sales growth, particularly in the services division, suggest a favorable investor sentiment. The cautious approach to AI investments, while raising some concerns, appears to be viewed positively in light of recent market volatility. Based on these factors, the consensus among multiple analyses supports a strong likelihood of continued upward momentum in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple's recent quarterly results present a mixed but ultimately positive outlook. The company exceeded overall revenue and EPS expectations, and the services division showed impressive growth. While iPhone sales were slightly below expectations, the company's guidance for the next quarter suggests growth is still anticipated. The pre-market jump of 3.5% indicates positive investor sentiment in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release. Reviewing past predictions, there is a strong leaning on the rising probability. Given the slight miss of iPhone sales and conservative AI investment that might influence the price in the future, I assign more weight to the positive momentum, but maintain a slight risk factor. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results show a mixed bag but lean positive overall.  While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the company beat revenue and EPS projections significantly. The services sector's strong performance is a major positive, exceeding forecasts by a considerable margin.  The positive outlook for Q2, though modest, suggests continued growth.  A 3.5% pre-market jump reflects immediate positive investor sentiment. The cautious approach to AI, while potentially limiting future upside in that sector, is viewed favorably as a sign of fiscal prudence, particularly in a volatile market.  The consensus of previous model predictions strongly favors a price rise, ranging from 0.65 to 0.78.  Considering the strong earnings beat, the positive outlook, robust services revenue, and the initial market reaction, the probability of a price increase is high. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and the relatively cautious AI strategy introduce some risk of a short-term correction or consolidation. To reflect this balance, a probability slightly lower than the highest prediction from previous models, but still reflecting the positive overall sentiment, is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a strong quarterly performance with earnings and revenue surpassing analyst expectations, leading to a 3.5% premarket increase in stock price. The positive outlook for future sales growth, particularly in the iPhone market, and significant growth in the services division bolster investor confidence. Although there was a slight decline in iPhone sales, the overall performance and optimistic projections outweigh this negative aspect.

The company's revenue and earnings per share surpassed projections, and the services division showed significant growth.
