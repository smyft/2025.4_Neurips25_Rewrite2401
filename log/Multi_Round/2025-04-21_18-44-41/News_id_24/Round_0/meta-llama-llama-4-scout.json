The company's services division showed significant growth with a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, exceeding forecasted revenue. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's optimistic outlook for its fiscal second-quarter sales, predicting growth in the single digits to mid-range single digits, suggests a positive trend.

Apple's strong quarterly results, optimistic outlook for the fiscal second quarter, and growth in its services division are key factors contributing to the estimated probabilities. The slight decrease in iPhone sales is a negative point but seems to be outweighed by the positive aspects of the report and the company's strategy. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.65 (or 65%), and the probability of it falling is 0.35 (or 35%)."
