The article suggests a potential shift in market sentiment away from the 'Magnificent 7', but this is a broad observation and doesn't directly impact Apple in a significant way based on the provided information. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Given the lack of specific negative or positive information about Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome, reflected in probabilities close to 0.5 for both rise and fall, with a slight lean towards a fall due to the general sentiment shift mentioned.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Batman Is a Great Movie\u2014and a Lousy Stock Portfolio.
