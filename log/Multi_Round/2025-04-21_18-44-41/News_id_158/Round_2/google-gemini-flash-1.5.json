(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further declines if breached. Analysts suggest that if the stock falls below this level, it could lead to additional selling pressure, with a potential target around $208. However, there is also the possibility of a rebound if the upcoming earnings report exceeds expectations, which could attract buyers at this key level. Given the current sentiment and technical indicators, the probability of a stock price fall appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news paints a bearish picture for Apple in the short term. The stock is underperforming, approaching its 200-day moving average (a key support level), and analysts are suggesting further declines if it breaks that level. The negative sentiment is compounded by the fact that Apple has been eclipsed by Nvidia as the largest company by market value. While a positive earnings report could trigger a rebound, the article emphasizes the potential for further downside. The S&P 500's resilience despite Apple's struggles suggests that the market isn't entirely dependent on Apple's performance, but a broader tech selloff could exacerbate the situation. Given the technical analysis pointing towards further declines and the overall negative sentiment, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise. However, the upcoming earnings report introduces uncertainty, and the 200-day moving average could act as a buying opportunity for some investors, limiting the potential downside.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's stock is experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, falling 11% and nearing its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level.  Technical analysts like Stockton predict further declines, potentially to around $208, if this level is breached.  However, Sohn points out that the 200-day moving average can also attract buyers looking for a discount.  The upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a major catalyst that could significantly impact the stock price.  A beat could trigger a rebound, while a miss could exacerbate the decline. Considering the bearish technical indicators, the negative year-to-date performance, and the potential for further downside if the 200-day moving average is broken, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term. However, the possibility of a positive earnings report and subsequent buying pressure cannot be ignored.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% slump, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could signal further downside, with potential support around $208. However, the upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could serve as a major catalyst, potentially leading to a rebound if results exceed expectations. The market's resilience despite Apple's decline is noted, but continued weakness in Apple could pose risks to broader indices. The analysis suggests a cautious outlook with potential for further decline unless earnings provide positive surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's stock has had a rough start to the year, slumping 11% and underperforming the S&P 500. The stock is now near a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal more downside if breached. Technical analysts suggest that if the stock falls below this level, the next support level could be around $208. However, there's also a possibility that the stock could rebound, especially if Apple reports strong earnings. Considering these factors, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the technical analysis and market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline in stock price through Thursday's close. The stock is approaching its 200-day moving average, a key technical level that could signal more downside ahead if breached. Technical analysts, such as Katie Stockton, anticipate further declines, with a potential target of $208 based on Ichimoku analysis. However, the upcoming quarterly earnings report on January 30 could be a catalyst for a rebound if Apple beats analyst expectations. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the current downward trend and technical indicators, but still assign a significant probability to a potential rise if the earnings report exceeds expectations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's stock has been experiencing significant declines, reaching levels close to a critical technical support at the 200-day moving average. Analysts expect further declines if this level is broken, suggesting a bearish trend. However, strong quarterly earnings could potentially act as a catalyst for a recovery. Given the recent performance and technical indicators, the probability leans towards a further decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is facing significant downward pressure, having experienced an 11% decline this year, which is the worst start since 2008. The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could signal further declines if breached. Analysts suggest that if the stock falls below this level, it could lead to additional selling pressure, with a potential target around $208.

Given the mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the current downward trend and technical indicators, but still assign a significant probability to a potential rise if the earnings report exceeds expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is strongly bearish, with probabilities of a price fall consistently around 0.65-0.7. The news headline and content emphasize Apple's poor performance, proximity to a key support level (200-day moving average), and analyst predictions of further decline. While a positive earnings report could trigger a rebound, the prevailing sentiment and technical indicators point towards continued downward pressure. Given the strong bearish sentiment in previous rounds, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more pessimistic outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds, with its worst start to the year since 2008 and a close approach to a key technical support level (200-day moving average).  The consensus among analysts is bearish, with predictions of further declines if this level is breached.  While a strong earnings report could trigger a rebound, the current technical indicators and market sentiment strongly suggest a higher probability of a price fall. The previous predictions from various models consistently point towards a higher probability of a price fall (ranging from 0.65 to 0.7).  The fact that several models, despite using different methodologies, arrive at similar conclusions strengthens the bearish outlook.  However, the possibility of a positive earnings surprise cannot be entirely discounted, hence the probability of a rise is not zero.  Considering all factors, a slightly more conservative estimate than the previous models is provided, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in stock market predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in 2025, with an 11% decline in stock price, marking its worst start since 2008.
