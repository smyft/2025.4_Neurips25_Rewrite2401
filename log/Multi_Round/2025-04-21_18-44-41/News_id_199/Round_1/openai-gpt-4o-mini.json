A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Nvidia has overtaken Apple in market capitalization, which may negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Additionally, Apple's shares fell 3% in the previous session, suggesting a bearish trend. The focus on AI and Nvidia's growth could further divert attention from Apple, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, the overall market sentiment and Apple's strong brand may provide some support, but the prevailing news suggests a higher likelihood of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company. This suggests negative sentiment towards Apple. While Apple is mentioned alongside other trending tickers, the primary focus is on Nvidia's success at Apple's expense. There is no specific positive news about Apple in this article to counteract the negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple's mention being incidental to Nvidia surpassing it as the most valuable company.  Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the news doesn't offer any specific positive catalysts for Apple. While the overall market sentiment might be positive due to the AI investment news, this is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term, given its lack of direct involvement in the \"Stargate Project\". The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a fall or sideways movement is higher, given the recent 3% drop and the lack of positive news directly related to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been overtaken by Nvidia (NVDA) as the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple in the short term due to losing its top position. Additionally, the focus of the news is more on Nvidia, Oracle, Netflix, Adidas, and JD Wetherspoon, with limited direct impact on Apple mentioned. The lack of positive catalysts for Apple in this news suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling or remaining stagnant rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions several companies, but the content specifically impacts Apple (AAPL) in relation to Nvidia (NVDA) becoming the world's most valuable company. Nvidia's rise and Apple's fall in market capitalization, along with Apple's 3% drop in the previous session, may negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term. However, the overall market and sector performance could influence Apple's stock movement. Given Nvidia's surge and the positive sentiment around AI investments, there's a potential for Apple's stock to face challenges, but it's also possible that Apple's strong fundamentals could mitigate the immediate negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization reaching nearly $3.45tn and Apple's market capitalization at $3.35tn. Additionally, Apple's shares fell 3% in the previous session. This suggests that Apple's stock price may be negatively affected by the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies such as Nvidia, Oracle, Netflix, and Adidas, with little direct mention of Apple. The decline in Apple's market cap relative to Nvidia could potentially affect investor sentiment towards Apple, but there is no direct news that impacts Apple's immediate stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
