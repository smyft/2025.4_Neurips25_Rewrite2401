(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Cloudflare CEO on why Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech leaders are bending to Trump\nNews Content: Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in the relationship between major tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Trump, suggesting a potential for more favorable regulatory conditions for the tech industry, particularly in cybersecurity. The optimism surrounding increased investment in tech and cybersecurity, along with the potential for looser regulations, could positively impact Apple's stock. However, the overall market sentiment and external factors could also influence stock movements. Given the context, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive implications of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potentially negative sentiment towards Apple due to Tim Cook's engagement with Donald Trump. However, the article primarily focuses on the cybersecurity sector and its potential growth under a Trump administration. While the initial reaction might be slightly negative due to the 'kissing the ring' narrative, the overall context suggests a potentially positive outlook for the tech industry, especially cybersecurity. Apple's involvement is mentioned only in passing, and the article doesn't directly link Apple's actions to any specific negative consequences. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. The positive outlook for cybersecurity, while not directly benefiting Apple, could contribute to a general positive sentiment towards the tech sector. Given the mixed signals and the indirect nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a small price rise due to the overall positive tech sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the relationship between Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Trump.  While it mentions that tech leaders were seen at Trump's inauguration, the article's main focus is on the cybersecurity sector's potential growth under a Trump administration.  The positive outlook for cybersecurity is linked to increased government investment, potential deregulation, and the growing need for cybersecurity in a more digital world.  Apple's direct involvement in the narrative is minimal; the article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's business prospects or actions related to Trump's policies. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Any price movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news unrelated to this specific article.  We assume a neutral stance, with slightly higher probability for no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the relationship between Big Tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential easing of tensions and possible regulatory benefits. However, the article primarily focuses on the cybersecurity sector's performance and outlook under Trump's administration, mentioning companies like Cloudflare, Fortinet, ZScaler, and Palo Alto Networks. While Apple is mentioned, the direct impact of the news on Apple's stock price is unclear, as the content does not provide specific information about Apple's business or regulatory changes affecting it. The broader tech sector's positive sentiment, especially in cybersecurity, might have a marginal indirect effect on Apple, but it is not a central theme. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this news is neutral to slightly positive, given the general tech sector optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the relationship between Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and President Donald Trump. The article mentions that tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, are 'bending to Trump' and trying to improve their relationships with him. However, the article does not contain any directly positive or negative news about Apple's products, services, or financial performance. The article primarily focuses on the tech industry's relationship with Trump and the potential benefits of a more favorable regulatory environment for cybersecurity companies. As Apple is not directly mentioned as a cybersecurity company, the news is more neutral than directly impactful. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards a lower probability of significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses how big tech companies, including Apple, are building relationships with President Donald Trump, which could lead to favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry. Additionally, the article highlights the growth potential of the cybersecurity sector, which could benefit Apple. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that the tech industry, including Apple, may experience growth and increased investment under Trump's administration. However, the article does not provide any direct, company-specific news that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the estimated probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are based on the general positive sentiment towards the tech industry and the potential for favorable policies and regulations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in the stance of major tech leaders, including Apple's CEO, towards former President Trump. While this might suggest a change in regulatory or market environment favorability towards tech companies, it doesn't directly indicate an immediate impact on Apple's specific financial performance or stock price. Additionally, the article focuses more on the cybersecurity sector's prospects and less on Apple specifically. However, given Apple's strong position in technology and cybersecurity measures within their products, any positive trends in the sector could indirectly benefit them.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in the relationship between major tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Trump, suggesting potential regulatory benefits for the tech industry, particularly in cybersecurity. While the article primarily focuses on the cybersecurity sector's growth prospects under a Trump administration, it implies a more favorable environment for tech companies, including Apple. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock is less clear, as the article does not provide specific information about Apple's business or financial performance. Given the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for increased investment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with some caution due to the mixed signals from previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, engaging with Donald Trump, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. While the article highlights the cybersecurity sector's growth prospects, Apple's direct benefit is less clear. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a slight rise due to general tech optimism, while others are neutral. Considering the lack of direct, company-specific news and the mixed prior predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not significantly so, as the impact is indirect and dependent on broader market factors and future policy changes.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the improved relationship between Big Tech CEOs and Donald Trump, with a particular emphasis on the positive outlook for the cybersecurity sector. While Apple is mentioned as one of the companies attending Trump's inauguration, the article lacks specific details about how this will directly impact Apple's financial performance.  The positive sentiment towards cybersecurity is relevant, but its impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and uncertain.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a slight increase in probability of a price rise due to the general positive tech sentiment, while others are more neutral. Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple and the mixed signals from the news, I'm assigning a probability closer to neutral. The previous predictions' range and the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple lead to a more conservative estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the relationship between Big Tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential easing of tensions and possible regulatory benefits.

However, the article primarily focuses on the cybersecurity sector's performance and outlook under Trump's administration. Given the indirect nature of the news regarding Apple and the mixed predictions from other models, I estimate a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. The overall sentiment towards the tech industry, especially in cybersecurity, might have a marginal indirect effect on Apple. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions from slightly positive to neutral, I will take a balanced approach, leaning slightly towards a positive outlook due to the general tech sector optimism.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the stance of major tech leaders, including Apple's CEO, towards former President Trump. While this might suggest a change in regulatory or market environment favorability towards tech companies, it doesn't directly indicate an immediate impact on Apple's specific financial performance or stock price.

However, given Apple's strong position in technology and cybersecurity measures within their products, any positive trends in the sector could indirectly benefit them. The provided predictions from previous models show a range of probabilities, reflecting mixed sentiments. Considering these factors, the estimated probability of a stock price rise or fall is moderate.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in the relationship between major tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Trump, suggesting potential regulatory benefits for the tech industry, particularly in cybersecurity.

However, the direct impact on Apple is unclear, as the article primarily highlights the cybersecurity sector's growth prospects. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, ranging from slightly positive to neutral.

The trend of previous predictions seems to be converging towards a more neutral stance, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the improved relationship between Big Tech CEOs and President Trump, with a positive outlook for the cybersecurity sector. While Apple is mentioned, the connection to Apple's stock price is tenuous and indirect.  The article doesn't offer specific information about Apple's business or policies that would directly impact its stock.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty about the news' impact.  The consensus leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the general positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the potential for increased investment in cybersecurity.
