(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock rebounds after report of iPhone sales slump in China\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) stock rebounded slightly Friday morning after Canalys reported a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, prompting Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings behind Huawei and Vivo.\n\nMorning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Seana Smith detail Big Tech's concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturer, as Apple plans to report quarterly earnings on Thursday, January 30.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n01:26\n\nApple stock falls after losing top smartphone spot in China: RPT\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:25\n\nApple's global iPhone sales decline 5% in holiday quarter: Report\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 days ago 06:55\n\nInvestors should 'get excited' about Meta if TikTok is banned\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:45\n\nBill Gates and Donald Trump Had a Three-Hour Dinner\n\nWSJ \u2022 1 hour ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The slight rebound suggests that investors may be reacting positively to the overall market sentiment or other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports. However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo could weigh on investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a notable chance of it falling due to the negative sales report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the headline indicates a rebound, the underlying report reveals a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, a crucial market. This negative news is compounded by concerns over potential Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th adds further uncertainty. The videos linked also suggest negative trends. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the 'rebound' mentioned in the headline suggests some positive sentiment remains.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While a drop in iPhone sales in China is negative and could pressure the stock price, the fact that Apple's stock *rebounded* slightly after the initial report suggests the market may have already priced in some of the negative news.  The upcoming earnings report (January 30th) will be crucial.  The rebound suggests that investors are either not overly concerned about the China sales slump or are anticipating positive news in other areas to offset it during the earnings call. The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty, making a definitive prediction difficult.  Given the rebound and the upcoming earnings report, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to 50/50.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline reports a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which caused Apple to slip to third place in the Chinese smartphone market. This suggests a mixed sentiment among investors. The rebound indicates some resilience or positive reaction to other factors not detailed in the news (e.g., broader market trends, upcoming earnings report). However, the underlying issue of declining sales in a critical market like China could weigh on the stock in the near term, especially with upcoming earnings. The probability of a rise is tempered by the negative sales data, while the probability of a fall is supported by the competitive pressures and sales decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rebounded slightly after a report of a steep drop in iPhone sales in China. However, the rebound suggests that investors may not be as concerned as initially thought, or the drop in sales may have been anticipated and priced in. The company's upcoming quarterly earnings report on Thursday, January 30, could also be a factor in investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility. Given that the stock rebounded slightly, it suggests that the market may have already partially priced in the negative news about iPhone sales in China. The concern over proposed Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers could continue to affect the stock, but the rebound indicates some resilience. Therefore, while there are concerns that could lead to a stock price drop, such as the decline in iPhone sales and competition, there is also potential for the stock to rise if Apple's earnings report is strong or if there are positive developments regarding tariffs or competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in iPhone sales in China, which initially caused Apple's stock to fall. However, the stock rebounded slightly, indicating that the market may have already factored in the decline or that investors are looking forward to the upcoming quarterly earnings report. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, as the decline in iPhone sales in China is a negative factor, but the rebound and upcoming earnings report introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's stock experienced a slight rebound after a report indicated a decline in iPhone sales in China, which caused Apple to drop to third place in smartphone sales behind Huawei and Vivo. The market response suggests a partial recovery from earlier losses, but ongoing concerns about tariffs and competition remain. With upcoming earnings reports, there may be further volatility as investors digest the mixed signals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the stock rebounded slightly after the report of a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, which is a critical market, this rebound may indicate that investors have already priced in some of the negative news. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds uncertainty, as it could either mitigate or exacerbate concerns about sales performance. The competition from Huawei and Vivo, along with potential tariffs, creates additional headwinds. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the rebound, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the negative sales report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The initial drop in iPhone sales in China is a significant negative, as highlighted by multiple models in the previous round. However, the subsequent rebound suggests some resilience or that the market had already priced in some of the negative news. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a key catalyst that could swing the stock price either way. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a slight bearish sentiment, but the rebound and the potential for a positive earnings surprise warrant a slightly less pessimistic outlook. The concerns about Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers remain relevant and contribute to the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news is mixed. A decline in iPhone sales in China is a significant negative factor, especially given Apple's loss of market share to competitors.  However, the immediate rebound suggests the market may have already partially priced in this negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors. The upcoming earnings report is a crucial catalyst for potential price movement.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the negative sales data, the ongoing competitive pressure, and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  However, the rebound suggests some resilience, preventing the probability of a fall from being significantly higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. On one hand, the reported slump in iPhone sales in China and the loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo are significant negatives, especially given China's importance as a market. On the other hand, the stock's slight rebound suggests that investors may have already priced in some of this negative news or are looking ahead to the upcoming earnings report for potential positive surprises. The mention of proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition adds further uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, which also reflect a divided sentiment, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, but the difference is not substantial due to the rebound and upcoming earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed sentiment for Apple's stock. On one hand, the stock rebounded slightly after a report of a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, which could have been expected to negatively impact the stock price. This rebound suggests that investors may have already priced in the negative news or are anticipating positive factors such as the upcoming quarterly earnings report. On the other hand, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo are negative factors. Additionally, concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers add to the uncertainty. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline reports a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China. This mixed signal, combined with the upcoming earnings report and concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers, introduces uncertainty. However, the rebound suggests that investors may not be as concerned as initially thought, or the drop in sales may have been anticipated and priced in. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of others' predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively close to 50% due to the uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed sentiment for Apple Inc. Despite the report of a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, Apple's stock rebounded slightly. This suggests that investors might be reacting positively to other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports, or that the market had already priced in some of the negative news. However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo still pose risks. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th and concerns over potential Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers add further uncertainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant negative factor, the stock has shown a slight rebound, indicating that investors may have already priced in some of the negative news or are anticipating positive developments from the upcoming earnings report on January 30. The competition from Huawei and Vivo, along with concerns over potential Trump tariffs, adds uncertainty to the situation. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the rebound, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the negative sales report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. The initial negative news of declining iPhone sales in China is significant, and the competition from Huawei and Vivo is a concern. However, the stock's rebound suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news or is anticipating positive developments in other areas. The upcoming earnings report is a crucial factor that could significantly influence the stock price. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight bearish sentiment, but the rebound and the potential for a positive earnings surprise warrant a balanced outlook. Given the mixed signals and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I am assigning probabilities closer to 50/50, with a slight edge to a price fall due to the underlying negative sales data.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  A significant drop in iPhone sales in China is undeniably negative. However, the immediate rebound suggests the market may have already partially priced in this negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors like the upcoming earnings report.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, clustering around a 50/50 split, with a slight tendency towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The consensus seems to be that the negative sales data, ongoing competitive pressure, and uncertainty surrounding the earnings report are significant factors.  The rebound, however, prevents a significantly higher probability of a fall. Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning probabilities closer to 50/50, slightly favoring a fall due to the weight of the negative sales news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. The slight rebound after a reported slump in iPhone sales in China suggests that investors may have partially priced in the negative news or are focusing on upcoming earnings reports. However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo, coupled with concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition, create significant headwinds. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th adds another layer of uncertainty. Given these mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions, which also reflect a divided sentiment, the probabilities are balanced but slightly leaning towards a fall due to the negative sales data and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock rebounded slightly after a report of a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, which caused Apple to slip to third place in the Chinese smartphone market behind Huawei and Vivo.

However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors are negative factors. Additionally, concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers add to the uncertainty. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple, with a reported slump in iPhone sales in China but a slight rebound in the stock price. This rebound suggests that investors may have already priced in some of the negative news or are looking ahead to the upcoming earnings report for potential positive surprises. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of others' predictions, which show a range of opinions but a slight lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.
