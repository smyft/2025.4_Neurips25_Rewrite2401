(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock rebounds after report of iPhone sales slump in China\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) stock rebounded slightly Friday morning after Canalys reported a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, prompting Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings behind Huawei and Vivo.\n\nMorning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Seana Smith detail Big Tech's concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturer, as Apple plans to report quarterly earnings on Thursday, January 30.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n01:26\n\nApple stock falls after losing top smartphone spot in China: RPT\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:25\n\nApple's global iPhone sales decline 5% in holiday quarter: Report\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 days ago 06:55\n\nInvestors should 'get excited' about Meta if TikTok is banned\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:45\n\nBill Gates and Donald Trump Had a Three-Hour Dinner\n\nWSJ \u2022 1 hour ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The slight rebound suggests that investors may be reacting positively to the overall market sentiment or other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports. However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo could weigh on investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a notable chance of it falling due to the negative sales report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the headline indicates a rebound, the underlying report reveals a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, a crucial market. This negative news is compounded by concerns over potential Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th adds further uncertainty. The videos linked also suggest negative trends. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the 'rebound' mentioned in the headline suggests some positive sentiment remains.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While a drop in iPhone sales in China is negative and could pressure the stock price, the fact that Apple's stock *rebounded* slightly after the initial report suggests the market may have already priced in some of the negative news.  The upcoming earnings report (January 30th) will be crucial.  The rebound suggests that investors are either not overly concerned about the China sales slump or are anticipating positive news in other areas to offset it during the earnings call. The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty, making a definitive prediction difficult.  Given the rebound and the upcoming earnings report, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to 50/50.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline reports a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which caused Apple to slip to third place in the Chinese smartphone market. This suggests a mixed sentiment among investors. The rebound indicates some resilience or positive reaction to other factors not detailed in the news (e.g., broader market trends, upcoming earnings report). However, the underlying issue of declining sales in a critical market like China could weigh on the stock in the near term, especially with upcoming earnings. The probability of a rise is tempered by the negative sales data, while the probability of a fall is supported by the competitive pressures and sales decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rebounded slightly after a report of a steep drop in iPhone sales in China. However, the rebound suggests that investors may not be as concerned as initially thought, or the drop in sales may have been anticipated and priced in. The company's upcoming quarterly earnings report on Thursday, January 30, could also be a factor in investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility. Given that the stock rebounded slightly, it suggests that the market may have already partially priced in the negative news about iPhone sales in China. The concern over proposed Trump tariffs and competition from Asian manufacturers could continue to affect the stock, but the rebound indicates some resilience. Therefore, while there are concerns that could lead to a stock price drop, such as the decline in iPhone sales and competition, there is also potential for the stock to rise if Apple's earnings report is strong or if there are positive developments regarding tariffs or competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in iPhone sales in China, which initially caused Apple's stock to fall. However, the stock rebounded slightly, indicating that the market may have already factored in the decline or that investors are looking forward to the upcoming quarterly earnings report. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, as the decline in iPhone sales in China is a negative factor, but the rebound and upcoming earnings report introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's stock experienced a slight rebound after a report indicated a decline in iPhone sales in China, which caused Apple to drop to third place in smartphone sales behind Huawei and Vivo. The market response suggests a partial recovery from earlier losses, but ongoing concerns about tariffs and competition remain. With upcoming earnings reports, there may be further volatility as investors digest the mixed signals.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
