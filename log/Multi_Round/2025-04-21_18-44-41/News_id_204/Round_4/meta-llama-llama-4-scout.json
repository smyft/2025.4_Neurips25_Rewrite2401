(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge. Despite the injury, her investment activities have remained active.\n\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\n\nWhy It Matters: The trades have drawn attention following reports that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, outperforming most hedge funds and even the popular Inverse Cramer Stock Tracker. The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock sales that preceded a Department of Justice lawsuit against the company. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson has consistently maintained that all trades comply with federal disclosure requirements under the STOCK Act.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance, especially given her significant investment in other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially driving the stock price down. However, the overall market sentiment towards Apple remains strong, and the company's fundamentals are solid, which could mitigate the impact of her trades. Therefore, while there is a likelihood of a price drop due to her selling activity, the strong brand and market position of Apple may also support a rise in stock price. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's stock trades are often viewed as a signal, although their actual impact is debatable. Her selling of Apple shares could be interpreted negatively by some investors, potentially leading to a slight decrease in demand. However, Apple is a large, stable company, and one individual's trades are unlikely to have a significant long-term impact. The news also mentions her buying calls on GOOGL and AMZN, which could be seen as a positive signal for those stocks, but this analysis focuses solely on Apple. The overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance will likely be more significant drivers of its stock price. Given the limited information and the inherent uncertainty, a slight downward pressure is anticipated, but not a major crash.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple stock is the key piece of information. While the sale itself is significant (31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million), it's crucial to consider the context.  The news doesn't provide any insight into *why* she sold.  It could be due to portfolio rebalancing, personal financial needs, or even a negative outlook on Apple's future. However, the fact that this is just one data point among many influencing Apple's stock price makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The overall market sentiment, Apple's upcoming earnings reports, and other news will have a far greater impact.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards neutrality, reflecting the limited impact of this single event.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile investor whose trades are often followed, has sold a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares. This could be interpreted by the market as a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance, potentially leading to negative sentiment among other investors. However, Pelosi's trades are just one data point and may not reflect broader market trends or Apple's fundamentals. The impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain but could lean slightly negative due to the attention her trades receive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent stock trades include selling 31,600 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) valued between $5 million and $25 million. This significant sale by a high-profile figure can be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence in the stock. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's trades are subject to various interpretations and may not directly influence the stock's long-term performance. The news also mentions her purchases of call options in Alphabet and Amazon, which might indicate a bullish stance on the tech sector overall, but her sale of AAPL shares could counterbalance this perception for Apple's stock specifically.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news states that Nancy Pelosi has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), and instead invested in Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). This could be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), potentially leading to a decrease in their stock prices. However, it's essential to consider that Nancy Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the overall market sentiment or the companies' fundamental values. Additionally, the news may have already been factored into the stock prices, reducing the potential impact. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent trades indicate a significant shift in her portfolio, selling Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares while purchasing call options for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). Such actions by high-profile individuals like Pelosi could influence public perception and market sentiment, potentially affecting stock prices. However, individual trades do not necessarily imply direct causation on stock movements. The overall market conditions, company-specific news, and broader economic factors also play crucial roles.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of 31,600 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that could be interpreted negatively by the market, as it may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term performance. The fact that she is reallocating her investments towards other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon could further amplify this sentiment. While Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the perception of Pelosi's trades could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of a price fall. However, the overall market sentiment towards Apple is still relatively stable, which may mitigate the impact of her trades. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds, stemming from Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, suggests a continued downward pressure on the stock. While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the perception of a lack of confidence from a high-profile investor can influence market sentiment. The fact that multiple models have consistently leaned towards a price decrease reinforces this view. Therefore, I will adjust the probabilities slightly to reflect this consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant amount of Apple stock is the central piece of information. While this could be interpreted negatively by some investors, leading to decreased demand and a potential price drop, it's crucial to consider the context.  The news doesn't offer reasons for the sale, and her actions are just one factor among many influencing Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, but with significant uncertainty.  The overall market sentiment, Apple's financial health, and other news will likely have a much larger impact than this single event.  Considering the previous predictions and the lack of concrete reasons for Pelosi's sale, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty involved.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, is a significant move that could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance. Given her high-profile status and the attention her trades receive, this could lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially driving the stock price down. However, Apple is a large, stable company with strong fundamentals, and individual trades are unlikely to have a long-term impact. The overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance will likely be more significant drivers of its stock price. Balancing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of 31,600 Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially driving the stock price down. However, Apple is a large, stable company with strong fundamentals, which could mitigate the impact of her trades. Considering the overall market sentiment and Apple's performance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of a price drop than a rise, but the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news of Nancy Pelosi selling Apple shares and investing in other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon could be perceived as a negative signal for Apple's stock. However, considering the overall market sentiment, Apple's strong brand, and the fact that individual trades may not significantly impact the stock price, the effect might be mitigated. Given the context and previous predictions, which generally lean towards a slight negative impact but with a significant degree of uncertainty, the probabilities are estimated with a slight bias towards a price fall but acknowledging the potential for a rise due to the company's fundamentals and market position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's significant sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, might signal a lack of confidence in the company's short-term prospects. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially impacting the stock price negatively. However, Apple is a large and stable company, and the overall market sentiment and company fundamentals remain strong. Other models predict a slight to moderate decline in stock price based on Pelosi's action, but they also acknowledge the limited direct impact of such an event on the long-term trajectory of the company's stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of 31,600 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that could be interpreted negatively by the market, as it may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term performance. The fact that she is reallocating her investments towards other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon could further amplify this sentiment.

The previous predictions from various models consistently lean towards a slight to moderate decline in stock price, reflecting a consensus that the market may react negatively to her selling activity. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across previous rounds, stemming from Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, suggests continued downward pressure. While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the perception of a lack of confidence from a high-profile investor can influence market sentiment. The fact that multiple models have consistently leaned towards a price decrease reinforces this view. However, the magnitude of the impact is likely limited, and the market may have already priced in this information. Therefore, I will maintain a higher probability of a price fall, but slightly reduce the magnitude of the difference between the probabilities of rise and fall, acknowledging the potential for market correction or overreaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a substantial amount of Apple stock is the primary driver of the analysis.  While this action could be interpreted negatively by some investors, leading to decreased demand and a potential price drop, it's crucial to consider the context. The news doesn't provide reasons for the sale, and her actions are just one factor among many influencing Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7.  However, Apple's strong fundamentals and overall market sentiment could mitigate the negative impact.  Considering the previous predictions, the lack of concrete reasons for Pelosi's sale, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock movements based on a single event, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty involved. The consistent downward trend in predictions across multiple rounds reinforces the likelihood of a price decrease, although the magnitude is uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple Inc.

(AAPL) shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million. This sale, combined with her purchases of call options in Alphabet and Amazon, could be interpreted as a negative signal for Apple's stock. The consistent predictions from previous rounds, mostly leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, reinforce this view. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and market position, the impact of Pelosi's trades is likely to be limited.

(AAPL) valued between $5 million and $25 million, combined with her purchases in other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon, suggests a shift in her investment strategy. Although this could signal a lack of confidence in Apple's short-term performance, Apple remains a fundamentally strong and stable company. The impact of individual trades by high-profile investors is often overestimated, and market sentiment, broader economic factors, and company-specific news typically play a larger role in stock price movements. The trend among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but with a notable degree of uncertainty. Considering the strong fundamentals and market position of Apple, the potential price movement is expected to be limited.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of 31,600 shares of Apple Inc.

The fact that multiple models have consistently leaned towards a price decrease reinforces this view. However, the magnitude of the impact is likely limited, and the market may have already priced in this information. Also, the models seem to be converging on a probability, so I will follow the trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant amount of Apple stock is the primary factor influencing the prediction. While this could negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a price drop, several mitigating factors exist. Apple's strong fundamentals and overall market position could lessen the impact of this single event.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7, reflecting a consensus view. However, the magnitude of the impact is likely limited, and the market may have already partially priced in this information.  Considering the consistent downward trend in predictions across multiple rounds, the likelihood of a price decrease is reinforced.  However, the probability of a rise is not negligible due to Apple's inherent strength and the potential for overreaction in the market.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty involved.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant amount of Apple Inc.
