(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The historical performance of Apple stock, with a significant return since 2018, suggests strong investor confidence. The overall positive sentiment towards long-term investments in successful companies, as illustrated by the author's portfolio, further supports the likelihood of a stock price rise. However, the mention of slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainties introduces some risk, leading to a balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article is generally positive for Apple. It highlights Apple's resilience, strong performance in its services segment, and continued dominance in the smartphone market. The article emphasizes that selling Apple stock too soon would have been a costly mistake, given its significant returns. The author's personal experience of holding Apple for a long time and benefiting from its growth further reinforces a positive outlook. However, the article also acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainty. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negative, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall. The mention of past 'Double Down' recommendations and their success also subtly encourages a positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece detailing the author's personal investment portfolio and the rationale behind their holdings.  It mentions Apple as one of their top five holdings, highlighting Apple's continued success despite challenges like slowing iPhone sales, emphasizing the strength of its services segment. The author expresses confidence in Apple's future prospects. However, this is a personal opinion and not a professional financial analysis. The news itself doesn't contain any new information about Apple's financial performance or future plans that would significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is low.  The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the author's positive sentiment, but this is heavily tempered by the lack of substantial new information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's top five portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc.

For Apple specifically, the article highlights its continued dominance in the smartphone market, the growth of its services segment, and its historical performance despite economic downturns. The author's positive sentiment and long-term holding strategy suggest confidence in Apple's future performance. However, the article does not provide any immediate catalysts or negative indicators that would suggest a short-term price decline. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely moderate given its reflective nature rather than providing new, actionable information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

(AAPL). The article highlights the company's resilience, particularly in its services segment, which has generated growth in each of the past four years despite economic downturns. The author also notes that Apple's stock has returned 350% since it became a $1 trillion company in 2018, outperforming the S&P 500. Given this positive sentiment and the lack of any negative news, it is likely that the stock price will rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of the author's largest holdings and discusses the company's resilience and continued growth despite challenges.

(AAPL), highlighting its resilience and growth potential, particularly in its services segment, despite challenges in iPhone sales. The author's long-term investment success with Apple and the emphasis on the importance of holding stocks through volatility further support a bullish sentiment. While there are concerns about slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainties, the overall tone and historical performance of Apple suggest a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL), primarily due to the article's emphasis on the company's resilience, strong performance in its services segment, and the author's positive long-term investment strategy. While the article acknowledges potential headwinds like slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainty, the overall sentiment is bullish. The consistent 'buy and hold' message and the historical outperformance of Apple stock further reinforce this positive view. Given the trend of previous predictions and the lack of significantly negative information, I will maintain a slightly positive outlook, but temper it slightly due to the acknowledged risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings, with Apple being one of them.  While the article expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the success of its services segment, it doesn't contain any material new information that would significantly impact the stock price. The positive comments are largely retrospective, focusing on past performance and long-term investment strategies.  The mention of slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainty introduces a counterbalance to the positive sentiment. Considering the lack of new information and the inherent volatility of the stock market, the probability of a price movement directly attributable to this news is relatively low.  The consensus of previous models leans slightly towards a price rise, but I'm assigning a more neutral probability reflecting the limited impact of this particular news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc.

While there are mentions of slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainties, the overall tone of the article is optimistic. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which generally lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and taking into account the lack of new, negative information about Apple, the estimated probabilities are skewed towards a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's continued resilience and success in its services segment, despite challenges in iPhone sales.

The author's long-term investment success with Apple and the emphasis on the importance of holding stocks through volatility further support a bullish sentiment.

While it acknowledges potential headwinds like slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainty, the author's personal investment success and confidence in Apple's future contribute to a bullish sentiment. The consensus from previous rounds also leans towards a positive outlook. However, the article lacks new, actionable information that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Considering these factors, I maintain a slightly positive outlook, but temper it due to the acknowledged risks and the lack of immediate catalysts. The previous rounds' predictions have been consistently positive, which further supports a slightly higher probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article is a positive but ultimately non-actionable piece focusing on a long-term investor's portfolio and their rationale for holding Apple. While it highlights Apple's strengths (services segment growth, market dominance), it also acknowledges weaknesses (slowing iPhone sales, economic uncertainty).  The article's main point is the value of long-term investing, not a prediction of Apple's imminent stock price movement.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price rise, but this is largely based on Apple's overall positive outlook and not directly on the information in this specific news piece.  The lack of new, material information means the impact of this news on the stock price is likely minimal.

The article's main point is the value of long-term investing, not a prediction of Apple's imminent stock price movement. The lack of new, material information means the impact of this news on the stock price is likely minimal. The consistent positive sentiment from previous prediction rounds, however, suggests a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the overall positive market sentiment towards Apple.
