(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\nNews Content: When Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, the stakes are particularly high. 1. At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials. Wall Street analysts see only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales from a year before, so it may mean another year of low iPhone growth, like in fiscal 2022 through 2024.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This slow growth, continuing a trend from the past couple of years, suggests that the upcoming earnings report might disappoint investors who were hoping for stronger performance. While other Apple product lines could offset this, the iPhone's dominance makes this a key indicator.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, although the probability isn't absolute given other factors not mentioned in the news (e.g., performance of services, other product lines, overall market sentiment). The probability estimates are subjective and based on the limited information provided.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```\n"
