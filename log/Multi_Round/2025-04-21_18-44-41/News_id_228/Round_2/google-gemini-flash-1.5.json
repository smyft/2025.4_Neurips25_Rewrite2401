(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential thawing of relations between President Trump and major tech executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook. This could be perceived positively by investors, as improved relations may lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple and other tech companies. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive signal from the attendance at the inauguration may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least less negative, relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration. While past tensions existed, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The overall impact is likely slightly positive, as maintaining a good relationship with the government is generally beneficial for large corporations. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and general market news is less directly relevant to Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  However, the article's focus is broader, covering the general relationship between Trump and Big Tech, and also mentions ongoing legal challenges facing large tech companies.  The connection between Cook's attendance and a direct impact on Apple's stock price is weak.  The article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. The probability of price movement is largely attributed to other market factors not mentioned in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration. This could signal improved relations, reducing regulatory risks. However, ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases remain a concern. The market may react positively to the perceived political goodwill, but uncertainties about future regulations temper the optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are tensions between Trump and some tech companies in the past, the attendance of major tech executives like Elon Musk and Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relationships. This development could be seen as positive for Apple and other tech companies, as it implies a potential easing of regulatory pressures and a more favorable business environment. However, the overall impact on the stock price is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the outcome of antimonopoly cases and the companies' ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending his inauguration. This could be seen as a positive sign for Apple, as it may indicate a more favorable business environment. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could be a negative factor. Given that the news is more neutral than directly positive or negative, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The attendance of tech executives at the inauguration might slightly lean towards a positive interpretation, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration suggests efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, the article also highlights ongoing legal challenges faced by Big Tech, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the mixed implications, there is moderate uncertainty but no clear indicator of a significant short-term movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential thawing of relations between President Trump and major tech executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook. This could be interpreted positively by investors, as improved relations may lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduces uncertainty. Overall, the positive signal from the attendance at the inauguration suggests a higher probability of stock price rise, but the legal challenges temper this optimism. Considering the previous predictions, a moderate probability of stock price rise is warranted, with a slightly lower probability of falling due to the mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially improved relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration, as evidenced by Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration. This could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. However, ongoing antitrust concerns and legal challenges for Big Tech remain a concern. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight positive sentiment overall, but with some uncertainty. The trend seems to be converging towards a more neutral outlook. Therefore, I'll adjust the probabilities slightly towards a more balanced view, leaning a bit towards a rise due to the potential for improved relations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price. While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted as a positive sign for maintaining a favorable relationship with the administration, this is countered by the ongoing legal challenges facing Big Tech.  The news piece itself doesn't offer any specific information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, clustering around 0.5, reflecting the ambiguity of the news. Considering the lack of concrete positive or negative information directly impacting Apple, and the consensus of previous models, I'm assigning probabilities close to even odds.  The slight lean towards a rise reflects the potential, albeit weak, positive interpretation of Cook's attendance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggests potential improved relations with the administration, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. On the other hand, ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases against Big Tech remain a concern. Previous predictions indicate a generally neutral to slightly positive sentiment (probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.65 for a rise). Given the lack of direct financial impact and the balanced nature of the news, the stock price movement is likely to be modest, with a slight edge towards a positive reaction due to the potential for reduced regulatory risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relationships, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny against Big Tech companies could create uncertainty. Given the mixed implications of the news, with both potential for improved relations and ongoing regulatory challenges, there is a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the perceived effort to maintain a favorable relationship with the administration.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration. This could be seen as a positive sign for Apple, as it may indicate a more favorable business environment. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could be a negative factor. Considering the mixed implications and the attendance of tech executives at the inauguration, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The overall sentiment from previous predictions suggests a slight leaning towards a positive interpretation, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential improvement in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of key tech executives, including Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. This development could be seen as positive for Apple, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment and reduced regulatory pressure. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust cases, which could temper the positive outlook. The majority of previous predictions indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, though with significant uncertainty due to legal challenges.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
