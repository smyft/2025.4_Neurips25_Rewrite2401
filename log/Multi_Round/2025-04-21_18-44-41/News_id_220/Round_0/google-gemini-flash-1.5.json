While her trades don't necessarily predict market movements, the fact that she sold a significant number of shares ($5M-$25M worth) could be interpreted by some investors as a bearish signal.  This could trigger some selling pressure, especially given the attention her trades receive. However, the impact is likely to be limited.  Pelosi's trades are often seen as having limited predictive power, and the overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance will be far more influential factors.  The news is unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in price, but a slight negative impact is possible.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, but both probabilities remain relatively low, reflecting the limited influence of a single insider trade.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```\n"
