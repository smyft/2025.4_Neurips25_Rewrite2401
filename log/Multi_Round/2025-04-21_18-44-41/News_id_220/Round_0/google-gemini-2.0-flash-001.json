On one hand, a prominent figure like Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple shares (between $5M and $25M) could be interpreted negatively by some investors, potentially leading to a sell-off. The market often reacts to high-profile trades, especially those made by individuals perceived to have inside information or superior market timing. However, the sale occurred on Dec 31, 2024, and the news is being reported later, which reduces the immediate impact. Also, Pelosi's portfolio adjustments are influenced by various factors, not solely the prospects of individual companies. Her move into Alphabet and Amazon doesn't necessarily indicate a negative outlook for Apple, but rather a reallocation of assets. Given the timing and the overall market context, the negative impact is likely to be moderate. The market's reaction to Pelosi's trades is often overblown, and Apple's fundamentals remain strong. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is limited.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
