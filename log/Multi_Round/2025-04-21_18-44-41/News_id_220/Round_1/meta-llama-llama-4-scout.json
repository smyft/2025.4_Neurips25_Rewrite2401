(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi's latest congressional trading disclosure reveals new bets on tech giants Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while offloading Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nAccording to the filing, Pelosi purchased 50 call options on Alphabet and Amazon with a $150 strike price and a Jan. 16, 2026, expiration date, each worth between $250,001 and $500,000. The trades took place on Jan. 14, 2025. Meanwhile, she sold 31,600 Apple shares on Dec. 31, 2024, in a transaction valued between $5M and $25M. On the same day, she sold 10,000 Nvidia shares, worth $1M to $5M, but also purchased Nvidia shares worth up to $500,000 on Jan. 14, 2025.\n\nBeyond big tech, Pelosi added Palo Alto Networks (PANW) shares worth up to $5M, Tempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) shares worth up to $100,000, and Vistra (NYSE:VST) shares worth up to $1M. At 84, Pelosi remains an active market participant, continuing to adjust her portfolio amid shifting economic and tech trends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's decision to sell a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) valued between $5M and $25M may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance. This action, especially from a high-profile investor, could lead to negative sentiment among other investors, potentially driving the stock price down. Additionally, the news highlights her investment in other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon, which may divert attention and capital away from Apple. However, the overall market conditions and Apple's fundamentals will also play a crucial role in determining the stock's movement. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news event presents a mixed signal for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, a prominent figure like Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple shares (between $5M and $25M) could be interpreted negatively by some investors, potentially leading to a sell-off. The market often reacts to high-profile trades, especially those made by individuals perceived to have inside information or superior market timing. However, the sale occurred on Dec 31, 2024, and the news is being reported later, which reduces the immediate impact. Also, Pelosi's portfolio adjustments are influenced by various factors, not solely the prospects of individual companies. Her move into Alphabet and Amazon doesn't necessarily indicate a negative outlook for Apple, but rather a reallocation of assets. Given the timing and the overall market context, the negative impact is likely to be moderate. The market's reaction to Pelosi's trades is often overblown, and Apple's fundamentals remain strong. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares is the key piece of information regarding AAPL. While her trades don't necessarily predict market movements, the fact that she sold a significant number of shares ($5M-$25M worth) could be interpreted by some investors as a bearish signal.  This could trigger some selling pressure, especially given the attention her trades receive. However, the impact is likely to be limited.  Pelosi's trades are often seen as having limited predictive power, and the overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance will be far more influential factors.  The news is unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in price, but a slight negative impact is possible.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, but both probabilities remain relatively low, reflecting the limited influence of a single insider trade.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the company's short-term performance, which might influence market sentiment negatively. However, Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors beyond a single investor's actions, including overall market conditions, company earnings, and macroeconomic trends. Given Pelosi's reputation and the visibility of her trades, the sale might have a moderate negative impact in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and market position could mitigate this effect.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of 31,600 Apple shares, valued between $5M and $25M, on Dec. 31, 2024, could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially indicating a loss of confidence in the company's short-term prospects. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's actions may not necessarily reflect her current views, as there could be various reasons for the sale. Additionally, the news does not provide any direct negative information about Apple's fundamentals or future outlook. The sale of Apple shares while purchasing call options on Alphabet and Amazon might suggest a rotation within the tech sector rather than a complete dismissal of tech stocks. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising might decrease slightly due to the perceived negative signal from a prominent investor, while the probability of the stock price falling could increase, but not drastically, as the overall impact of this single transaction is relatively limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile investor, has sold a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) and purchased call options on Alphabet and Amazon. This could be perceived as a vote of no confidence in Apple's stock, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence and a subsequent fall in stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value or future prospects. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares might be a portfolio rebalancing move rather than a bearish bet on the company. Given the information, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
