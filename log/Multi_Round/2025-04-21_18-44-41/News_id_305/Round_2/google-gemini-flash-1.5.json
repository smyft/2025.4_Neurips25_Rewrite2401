(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Falls to Second Place Globally as Samsung's S24 Dominates Smartphone Market\nNews Content: Following Samsung (SSNLF), Counterpoint Research notes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now ranks second in worldwide smartphone market share for 2024. Apple commands a 18%, down from 19% last year; Samsung keeps 19%, a little decline from 20% in 2023\n\n.With the popular A-series portfolio and significant demand for its AI-oriented S24 series, Samsung maintains leadership. In Europe and the United States, the S24 series excels especially, reinforcing Samsung's position.Apple's iPhone 16 series gets mixed reviews, mainly related to Apple Intelligence feature delays. Apple does, however, find expansion in areas such Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nDemand for the Pro and Pro Max variants keeps rising in China; Q4 2024 sales might even reach 50%.Reversing a decade-low in 2023, global smartphone sales climb 4% in 2024. Globally, consumer sentiment is improving; in Europe, China, and Latin America especially, it is showing a healthy improvement.\n\nApple is providing discounts on iPhone 16 models in China in order to keep its hold in a very cutthroat market while challenging Huawei.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline in market share from 19% to 18% and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series suggest potential challenges for Apple. However, the company is expanding in emerging markets and seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China, which could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the combination of losing market share and mixed product reviews leads to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Losing the top spot in global smartphone market share to Samsung is a negative indicator, especially with Samsung's S24 series performing well in key markets like Europe and the US. The mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features further contribute to the negative sentiment. However, Apple is showing growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for Pro models remains strong in China. The overall smartphone market is also growing, which is a positive sign. Apple's discounting strategy in China suggests they are actively fighting for market share. Considering these factors, the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The long-term impact is less clear and depends on the success of future product launches and Apple's ability to regain market share.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed for Apple. While losing the top spot in global smartphone market share to Samsung is negative, the overall market is growing, and Apple is showing strength in certain regions (Asia, Africa, Latin America) and with its Pro models in China.  The discounts in China suggest a competitive response, which could impact margins but maintain market share.  The delays in the Apple Intelligence feature are also a negative, potentially impacting sales of the iPhone 16.  However, the overall positive global consumer sentiment and growth in the smartphone market could offset some of the negative impacts. Considering the mixed nature of the news, a moderate probability of both price increase and decrease is assigned, with a slight lean towards a price decrease due to the loss of market share leadership and the need for discounts in a key market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%. This could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple is showing growth in emerging markets like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for Pro and Pro Max variants in China remains strong. Additionally, global smartphone sales are improving, and Apple is taking measures like discounts in China to maintain competitiveness. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may weigh on the stock, but the overall market conditions and strategic adjustments could mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has fallen to second place globally in the smartphone market, surpassed by Samsung. Apple's market share has decreased to 18% from 19% last year, while Samsung's market share is 19%, slightly down from 20% in 2023. However, the article also mentions positive trends for Apple, such as growing demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants in China and expansion in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Additionally, global smartphone sales have increased by 4% in 2024, and consumer sentiment is improving. Despite the mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series, the overall impact seems to be neutral to slightly negative due to the loss of the top spot and the need for discounts in China. However, the long-term growth prospects and regional expansions could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, with Samsung taking the lead. Although Apple's market share has decreased, the company is still experiencing growth in certain regions such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Additionally, demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants is rising in China. However, the mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may negatively impact the stock price. The overall improvement in global smartphone sales and consumer sentiment is a positive sign, but Apple's loss of market share to Samsung may outweigh these positives. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market due to increased competition from Samsung. Although Apple sees growth in certain regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the overall sentiment is negative with declining market share and challenges in product reception. The mixed reviews and delays in key features could impact sales, particularly in major markets like Europe and the United States. Additionally, the need to provide discounts in China suggests competitive pressure and could affect profit margins. These factors contribute to a more pessimistic outlook for Apple's stock performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, which is a significant negative factor for investor sentiment. The decline in market share from 19% to 18% and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series suggest potential challenges ahead. However, Apple is expanding in emerging markets and seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China, which could mitigate some negative impacts. The overall smartphone market is also growing, which is a positive sign. Despite these positives, the loss of market leadership and the need for discounts in a competitive market weigh heavily on the outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The primary negative is losing the top spot to Samsung in global smartphone market share, coupled with mixed reviews and delays for the iPhone 16 series and Apple Intelligence. This is further compounded by the need for discounts in China, indicating competitive pressure. However, there are positives: growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, strong demand for Pro models in China, and an overall improving smartphone market. Considering the previous rounds' predictions leaning towards a price decrease, and the continued negative pressure from market share loss, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price fall, but not drastically, as there are some mitigating positive factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news is mixed, presenting both positive and negative factors for Apple's stock price.  The loss of the top spot in global smartphone market share to Samsung is a significant negative, especially given Samsung's strong performance with the S24 series in key markets.  Mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 and delays in the Apple Intelligence feature further contribute to negative sentiment.  The need for discounts in China also suggests competitive pressure and potential margin erosion. However, several mitigating factors exist.  Apple is expanding in emerging markets, and demand for Pro models remains strong in China.  The overall smartphone market is growing, and improving global consumer sentiment provides a positive backdrop.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the positive aspects prevent an overwhelmingly negative outlook.  The weight of the negative factors (loss of market share, mixed reviews, discounts) slightly outweighs the positives (emerging market growth, strong Pro model demand), leading to a prediction slightly skewed towards a price fall, but not as strongly as some previous models suggested.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a decline from 19% to 18%. The iPhone 16 series has received mixed reviews, particularly due to delays in Apple Intelligence features, and the company is resorting to discounts in China to maintain competitiveness, which could pressure margins. On the positive side, Apple is seeing growth in emerging markets (Asia, Africa, Latin America) and strong demand for Pro models in China. Global smartphone sales are also improving, and consumer sentiment is rising in key regions. However, the loss of market leadership and competitive pressures are likely to weigh more heavily on investor sentiment in the short term. Considering the balance of these factors and the consensus from previous predictions leaning slightly toward a decline, the probability of a stock price fall is marginally higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market share, with Samsung taking the lead. Apple's market share has decreased to 18% from 19% last year, while Samsung's market share is 19%, slightly down from 20% in 2023. However, Apple is showing growth in emerging markets like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants is rising in China. The mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may weigh on the stock, but the overall market conditions and strategic adjustments could mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the mixed nature of the news, a moderate probability of both price increase and decrease is assigned, with a slight lean towards a price decrease due to the loss of market share leadership and the competitive pressures in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the company is showing growth in emerging markets like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for Pro and Pro Max variants in China remains strong. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may weigh on the stock, but the overall market conditions and strategic adjustments could mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of both price increase and decrease, with a slight lean towards a price decrease due to the loss of market share leadership and the need for discounts in a key market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple has slipped to the second position in the global smartphone market, with a decline in market share from 19% to 18%. This is a significant shift given Samsung's continued dominance, especially in key markets like Europe and the U.S. The mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features further strain investor confidence. Although Apple is expanding in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and seeing strong demand for Pro models in China, the overall negative sentiment around its market leadership and product reception may overshadow these positives. The need for discounts in China indicates competitive pressure and potential margin erosion.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
