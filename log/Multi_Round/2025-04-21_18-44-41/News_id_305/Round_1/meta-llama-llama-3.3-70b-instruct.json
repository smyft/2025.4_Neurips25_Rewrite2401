(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Falls to Second Place Globally as Samsung's S24 Dominates Smartphone Market\nNews Content: Following Samsung (SSNLF), Counterpoint Research notes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now ranks second in worldwide smartphone market share for 2024.

In Europe and the United States, the S24 series excels especially, reinforcing Samsung's position.Apple's iPhone 16 series gets mixed reviews, mainly related to Apple Intelligence feature delays. Apple does, however, find expansion in areas such Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nDemand for the Pro and Pro Max variants keeps rising in China; Q4 2024 sales might even reach 50%.Reversing a decade-low in 2023, global smartphone sales climb 4% in 2024. Globally, consumer sentiment is improving; in Europe, China, and Latin America especially, it is showing a healthy improvement.\n\nApple is providing discounts on iPhone 16 models in China in order to keep its hold in a very cutthroat market while challenging Huawei.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in global smartphone market share, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The decline in market share from 19% to 18% and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series suggest potential challenges for Apple. However, the company is expanding in emerging markets and seeing rising demand for its Pro models in China, which could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the combination of losing market share and mixed product reviews leads to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Losing the top spot in global smartphone market share to Samsung is a negative indicator, especially with Samsung's S24 series performing well in key markets like Europe and the US. The mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features further contribute to the negative sentiment. However, Apple is showing growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for Pro models remains strong in China. The overall smartphone market is also growing, which is a positive sign. Apple's discounting strategy in China suggests they are actively fighting for market share. Considering these factors, the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The long-term impact is less clear and depends on the success of future product launches and Apple's ability to regain market share.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed for Apple. While losing the top spot in global smartphone market share to Samsung is negative, the overall market is growing, and Apple is showing strength in certain regions (Asia, Africa, Latin America) and with its Pro models in China.  The discounts in China suggest a competitive response, which could impact margins but maintain market share.  The delays in the Apple Intelligence feature are also a negative, potentially impacting sales of the iPhone 16.  However, the overall positive global consumer sentiment and growth in the smartphone market could offset some of the negative impacts. Considering the mixed nature of the news, a moderate probability of both price increase and decrease is assigned, with a slight lean towards a price decrease due to the loss of market share leadership and the need for discounts in a key market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the global smartphone market share to Samsung, with a slight decline from 19% to 18%. This could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple is showing growth in emerging markets like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and demand for Pro and Pro Max variants in China remains strong. Additionally, global smartphone sales are improving, and Apple is taking measures like discounts in China to maintain competitiveness. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may weigh on the stock, but the overall market conditions and strategic adjustments could mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has fallen to second place globally in the smartphone market, surpassed by Samsung. Apple's market share has decreased to 18% from 19% last year, while Samsung's market share is 19%, slightly down from 20% in 2023. However, the article also mentions positive trends for Apple, such as growing demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants in China and expansion in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Additionally, global smartphone sales have increased by 4% in 2024, and consumer sentiment is improving. Despite the mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series, the overall impact seems to be neutral to slightly negative due to the loss of the top spot and the need for discounts in China. However, the long-term growth prospects and regional expansions could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, with Samsung taking the lead. Although Apple's market share has decreased, the company is still experiencing growth in certain regions such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Additionally, demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants is rising in China. However, the mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and delays in Apple Intelligence features may negatively impact the stock price. The overall improvement in global smartphone sales and consumer sentiment is a positive sign, but Apple's loss of market share to Samsung may outweigh these positives. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market due to increased competition from Samsung. Although Apple sees growth in certain regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the overall sentiment is negative with declining market share and challenges in product reception. The mixed reviews and delays in key features could impact sales, particularly in major markets like Europe and the United States. Additionally, the need to provide discounts in China suggests competitive pressure and could affect profit margins. These factors contribute to a more pessimistic outlook for Apple's stock performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
