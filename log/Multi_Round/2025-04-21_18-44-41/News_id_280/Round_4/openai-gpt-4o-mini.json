(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in China, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo after previously being the leader. This decline in shipments (25% drop in Q4 and 17% for the full year) suggests increased competition and challenges for Apple in a crucial market. Although Apple managed to lead in Q4, the overall trend points to a weakening position. The introduction of price cuts and promotions may help, but the intense competition and geopolitical tensions could weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price fall due to these negative developments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Apple regained the top spot in China's smartphone market in Q4, the overall trend is concerning. Apple's shipments in China plummeted 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year, falling behind Vivo and Huawei in the overall 2024 market share. This indicates increasing competition and potential loss of market share in a crucial market. The rise of Huawei, fueled by patriotic sentiment and domestic chip advancements, poses a significant threat. Apple's attempts to counter this with discounts and improved retail experiences might not be enough to offset the negative impact. The overall market growth in China is a positive sign, but Apple's underperformance relative to its competitors suggests a potential negative impact on its stock price. Given the negative trends outweigh the positive, a stock price fall is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's decline in market share in the Chinese smartphone market is a significant negative factor.  While they regained the top spot in Q4 2024, their overall yearly performance shows a substantial drop (17% year-over-year) and a loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo. This suggests weakening market position in a key region.  The aggressive price cuts implemented by Apple to stimulate sales further highlight the competitive pressure they face.  The resurgence of Huawei, fueled by new domestically produced chips, poses a serious long-term threat.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's struggles within that market are concerning.  The positive Q4 performance might offer some short-term support, but the overall trend is negative.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, although the Q4 data might slightly mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining shipments in China, its second-most important market, with a 25% drop in the fourth quarter and a 17% drop for the full year 2024. The resurgence of Huawei and other domestic competitors, coupled with US-China tensions, has increased competition and patriotic buying tendencies, which could negatively impact Apple's market share. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows weakening performance in China. The company's efforts to boost sales through discounts and promotions may not be sufficient to counteract the competitive pressures and declining shipments. This is likely to weigh negatively on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) trailed Huawei and Vivo in the China smartphone market for the year 2024 but managed to lead in the fourth quarter. The overall shipment numbers for Apple in China fell significantly year-over-year, with a 25% decrease in the fourth quarter and a 17% decrease for the full year. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the annual performance was subpar due to intense competition from domestic players like Huawei, which saw a 37% increase in shipments for 2024. Apple's efforts to boost sales through discounts and improving retail experiences may provide some positive momentum. However, the negative annual shipment trends and competitive pressures are likely to impact investor sentiment negatively in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, behind Huawei and Vivo, despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter. The company's smartphone shipments in China plummeted 25% to 13.1 million units in the fourth quarter, and its full-year shipments fell 17% to 42.9 million units. This decline in sales, combined with rising domestic competition and US-China tensions, may negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the company's efforts to enhance its high-end competitiveness and user retention, as well as its introduction of new price cuts and promotions, may help to mitigate the decline. Additionally, Canalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China to surpass 290 million units this year, which could provide a positive outlook for the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's market share in China's smartphone market declined in 2024 compared to the previous year, falling behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows a decline in shipments, which could indicate potential challenges in maintaining market leadership. Additionally, increased domestic competition and geopolitical factors may further impact sales. However, Apple is taking steps to counteract these issues, such as offering discounts and enhancing retail experiences, which may help stabilize or even improve market position.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has experienced a significant decline in smartphone shipments in China, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo in 2024. Despite regaining the top spot in Q4, the overall trend shows a 25% drop in shipments for that quarter and a 17% decline for the full year. This suggests increased competition and challenges in a crucial market. The rise of Huawei, bolstered by domestic support and new technology, poses a serious threat to Apple's market share. Although Apple is implementing strategies like price cuts and improved retail experiences to boost sales, the negative trends in shipment numbers and market position are likely to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price fall due to these adverse developments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a concerning trend for Apple in China, its second-most important market. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4, the overall yearly performance shows a significant decline in shipments and market share, falling behind Huawei and Vivo. This is driven by increased competition from domestic players, particularly Huawei, fueled by patriotic sentiment and advancements in domestic chip technology. Apple's attempts to counter this with discounts and improved retail experiences may not be sufficient to offset the negative impact. The previous rounds of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reflecting the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance in China. Considering the continued negative trend and the consensus from previous predictions, I maintain a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While regaining the top spot in Q4 in China is positive, the overall 2024 performance shows a significant decline in shipments (-17%), losing market share to Huawei and Vivo. This signals increased competitive pressure in a key market.  Huawei's resurgence, driven by new chips and patriotic sentiment, is a major concern. Apple's price cuts and retail improvements are mitigating factors, but may not fully offset the negative impact of declining market share.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a stock price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 probability.  Considering the overall negative trend despite the Q4 recovery, and the consensus of previous models, I'm adjusting the probability of a fall slightly higher than the average of previous predictions to account for the sustained negative trend throughout the year. The overall market growth in China is a positive external factor, but Apple's underperformance relative to competitors outweighs this positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed performance for Apple in China's smartphone market. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4 2024, its overall annual performance declined significantly, with a 17% drop in shipments and a fall to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. The resurgence of Huawei, driven by domestic chip advancements and patriotic sentiment, poses a long-term threat. Apple's efforts to counter this with price cuts and improved retail experiences may provide some short-term relief, but the competitive pressures and geopolitical tensions are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, given the negative trends in market share and shipments. However, the Q4 recovery and strategic initiatives offer a slight counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has faced a decline in its market share in China's smartphone market in 2024, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo.

Apple's efforts to counter this with discounts and improved retail experiences may provide some short-term support but might not be enough to offset the negative impact of intense competition and geopolitical tensions. Given these factors, the overall trend points to a weakening position for Apple in a crucial market, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in China, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo after previously being the leader.

Despite regaining the top spot in the fourth quarter, the annual shipments show a significant drop. The company's efforts to counteract this through discounts and promotions may provide some support, but the overall trend and competitive pressures are concerning. The negative sentiment from declining shipments and increased competition is likely to outweigh any short-term benefits from promotional strategies.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has faced significant challenges in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo after previously being the leader.

Considering the continued negative trend and the consensus from previous predictions, I maintain a higher probability of a stock price fall. The slight uptick in some models' predictions for a rise in Round 1 compared to Round 0 might reflect a short-term positive reaction to Apple's Q4 performance, but the overall negative trend outweighs this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's performance in China presents a mixed picture. While regaining the top spot in Q4 is positive, the overall 17% year-over-year decline in shipments and loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo for the full year is a significant negative.  The resurgence of Huawei, driven by domestic chip production and patriotic sentiment, is a major long-term threat. Apple's price cuts and retail improvements are attempts to mitigate this, but their effectiveness remains uncertain.  The consensus from previous predictions consistently points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.  While the Q4 data offers some short-term relief, the overall negative trend throughout the year, coupled with the sustained competitive pressure from Huawei, outweighs the positive Q4 performance.

Increased competition from domestic players like Huawei, boosted by both technological advancements and patriotic sentiments, poses a significant threat. While Apple is implementing price cuts and improving retail experiences, these strategies may not sufficiently mitigate the negative impact of declining market share and intense competition. The overall trend of declining shipments and market position is likely to weigh heavily on investor sentiment, particularly considering the negative trends observed over the past rounds of predictions.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has faced significant challenges in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo after previously being the leader.

While the Q4 leadership offers a temporary positive, the overall trend of declining shipments (17% YoY) and market share loss to Huawei and Vivo is significant. Huawei's resurgence, fueled by domestic chip advancements and patriotic sentiment, poses a long-term threat. Apple's countermeasures, such as price cuts and retail improvements, may not be sufficient to offset these negative factors. The consistent negative sentiment in previous predictions reinforces the likelihood of a stock price fall. Therefore, I maintain a higher probability of a stock price fall, slightly adjusting based on the consistent trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple's performance in China's smartphone market presents a mixed picture.

The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. I'm considering this trend and the overall negative trend throughout the year, and therefore assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall.  However, the Q4 recovery and Apple's global strength provide some counterbalance, preventing an extremely pessimistic outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has faced significant challenges in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo after previously being the leader.
