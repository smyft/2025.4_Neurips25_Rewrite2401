A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a general decline in tech stocks, which typically suggests a negative sentiment in the sector. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech industry, it is likely to be affected by this broader market trend. The late afternoon timing of the news may also indicate a lack of investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, as evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) being in the red. This suggests a negative sentiment towards tech stocks overall. While Apple is a strong company, it is not immune to broader market trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. The lack of specific information about Apple's performance makes it difficult to give a more precise estimate, but the general sector weakness is a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) falling.  Since Apple is a major tech company, it's highly likely to be affected by this broader market trend.  However, without access to the full news article, we cannot assess the magnitude of the sector's decline or any specific factors affecting Apple. Therefore, the probabilities are estimations based on the limited information provided.  A higher probability of a price fall is assigned due to the negative sector-wide news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be affected by broader sector trends. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector, there is a higher probability that AAPL's stock price will fall in the short term. However, the exact impact is uncertain due to the limited information available (the full article is behind a paywall).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were in the red late Friday afternoon. This suggests a general downturn in the tech sector. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech company, it is likely that its stock price will be affected by this sector-wide decline. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late in the afternoon. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech company, it is likely that its stock price will also be affected by this trend. Given that the news specifically mentions tech stocks being in the red, it suggests a negative impact on the sector, which would increase the probability of the stock price falling and decrease the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a general decline in tech stocks late in the day on Friday. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a leading technology company, it's likely to be affected by the broader trend in the tech sector. There's no specific information about Apple in the snippet given, but it's reasonable to assume that the overall sentiment towards tech stocks could influence investor behavior.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a general decline in tech stocks, specifically mentioning that the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is in the red. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be negatively impacted by this broader market trend. The consensus among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reflecting the negative sentiment in the sector. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) experiencing a decline. Given that Apple is a significant player in the tech industry, it's reasonable to assume that this sector-wide downturn will negatively impact its stock price. The previous rounds of predictions consistently favored a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 0.7 or 0.8 probability. Considering this consensus and the lack of any specific positive news about Apple, I will maintain a similar outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a general decline in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) falling.  This negative sentiment is likely to impact Apple, a major tech company.  While Apple's individual performance might deviate, the overall market trend suggests a higher probability of a price drop.  The consensus among the previous models (ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 probability of a rise and 0.7 to 0.8 probability of a fall) reinforces this assessment.  The lack of specific news about Apple itself increases uncertainty, but the sector-wide negative trend is the dominant factor influencing the prediction. I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly to reflect the overall consensus while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty due to limited information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general decline in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) being in the red late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector and is likely to be affected by this broader market trend. Previous predictions from various models consistently suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for a decline and 0.2 to 0.3 for a rise. Given the lack of specific positive information about Apple in the news snippet and the negative sentiment in the tech sector, it is reasonable to align with the consensus of a higher probability of a stock price fall. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated accordingly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general decline in tech stocks late in the afternoon, as evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) being in the red. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector and is likely to be affected by this broader market trend. Given that the news specifically mentions tech stocks falling, it suggests a negative sentiment towards the sector, which would increase the probability of the stock price falling and decrease the probability of it rising. The predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Therefore, based on the general sector weakness and the consensus from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.27, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.73, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general decline in tech stocks, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) being in the red. This suggests a negative sentiment towards tech stocks overall. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech industry, it is likely to be affected by this broader market trend. The late afternoon timing of the news may also indicate a lack of investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. The previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, with an average probability of stock price falling of around 0.73. Considering this information, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a general decline in tech stocks late in the day on Friday.
