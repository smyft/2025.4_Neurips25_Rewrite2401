      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Sector Update: Tech Stocks Fall Late Afternoon\nNews Content: Tech stocks were in the red late Friday afternoon, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a general decline in tech stocks, which typically suggests a negative sentiment in the sector. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech industry, it is likely to be affected by this broader market trend. The late afternoon timing of the news may also indicate a lack of investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, as evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) being in the red. This suggests a negative sentiment towards tech stocks overall. While Apple is a strong company, it is not immune to broader market trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. The lack of specific information about Apple's performance makes it difficult to give a more precise estimate, but the general sector weakness is a significant factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) falling.  Since Apple is a major tech company, it's highly likely to be affected by this broader market trend.  However, without access to the full news article, we cannot assess the magnitude of the sector's decline or any specific factors affecting Apple. Therefore, the probabilities are estimations based on the limited information provided.  A higher probability of a price fall is assigned due to the negative sector-wide news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be affected by broader sector trends. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector, there is a higher probability that AAPL's stock price will fall in the short term. However, the exact impact is uncertain due to the limited information available (the full article is behind a paywall).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were in the red late Friday afternoon. This suggests a general downturn in the tech sector. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech company, it is likely that its stock price will be affected by this sector-wide decline. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late in the afternoon. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech company, it is likely that its stock price will also be affected by this trend. Given that the news specifically mentions tech stocks being in the red, it suggests a negative impact on the sector, which would increase the probability of the stock price falling and decrease the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a general decline in tech stocks late in the day on Friday. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a leading technology company, it's likely to be affected by the broader trend in the tech sector. There's no specific information about Apple in the snippet given, but it's reasonable to assume that the overall sentiment towards tech stocks could influence investor behavior.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
