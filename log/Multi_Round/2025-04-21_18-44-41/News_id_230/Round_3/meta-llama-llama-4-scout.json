(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc.'s vulnerability, particularly regarding its reliance on iPhone sales and the potential negative impact of the Chinese economy. Cramer suggests that many analysts expect Apple to underperform, which could lead to a bearish sentiment among investors. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it mentions Cramer's general positive sentiment towards Apple as a long-term investment ('own them, don't trade them'), it also highlights his concerns about the company's potential for a disappointing quarter and the impact of the Chinese economy. The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs' suggests a negative surprise is possible. The article also mentions that many analysts believe Apple could surprise to the downside. Given these factors, there's a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise in the short term. However, Cramer's overall positive view tempers the negativity, preventing a very high probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for a disappointing quarter, and the general market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic, indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The article also highlights the significant influence of the Chinese economy on Apple's performance, adding another layer of uncertainty.  The fact that many analysts predict a downside surprise suggests the market is already pricing in some negative news, reducing the probability of a significant positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the company's stock performance, particularly highlighting the risks associated with its heavy reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside surprises in its upcoming quarter. Cramer's comments suggest a cautious outlook on AAPL, influenced by broader market perceptions and concerns about innovation and valuation. Given the negative tone and the lack of positive catalysts mentioned in the news, it is more likely that AAPL's stock price could face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many research pieces are saying Apple could surprise to the downside, implying that the stock's performance may be weaker than expected. This negative sentiment expressed by Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and potentially cause the stock price to fall. However, it's worth noting that Cramer also advises investors to 'own them, don't trade them,' which might mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer believes that Apple's stock is vulnerable to reports of an iPhone downturn and that the company's reliance on iPhone sales makes it susceptible to decline. He also mentions that many analysts expect Apple to surprise to the downside, which could lead to a decrease in stock price. However, Cramer advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple's stock, indicating a long-term positive outlook. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.6, reflecting a slightly higher likelihood of a decline due to the potential downside risks mentioned by Cramer.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a cautious outlook for Apple, pointing out concerns over iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China. His skepticism about Apple's upcoming performance and the overall negative sentiment among analysts indicate a likely downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple's vulnerability, particularly its reliance on iPhone sales and the potential negative impact of the Chinese economy. Cramer's comments suggest a bearish sentiment, indicating that many analysts expect Apple to underperform, which could lead to a decline in stock price. While he acknowledges some long-term potential, the overall tone is cautious and suggests a higher likelihood of a price drop. This aligns with previous predictions that indicate a consensus towards a bearish outlook for AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from the previous round of predictions leans towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling, primarily due to Jim Cramer's cautious outlook and concerns about iPhone sales, the Chinese economy, and general market sentiment. Cramer's statement about Apple being a 'wildcard to the downside' and the expectation of a potential downside surprise further reinforce this bearish view. While Cramer advises to 'own, don't trade,' suggesting a long-term positive outlook, the immediate impact of the news is likely negative. Considering the consistent negative sentiment across multiple models in the previous round, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a stronger bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's somewhat bearish outlook on Apple's short-term prospects. While he advocates for long-term holding ('own them, don't trade them'), his concerns about iPhone sales dependence, potential for a disappointing quarter, and the impact of the Chinese economy outweigh his long-term optimism in the context of this specific news.  The consensus among analysts, as highlighted by Cramer, points towards a downside surprise.  Previous model predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Considering this collective sentiment and the lack of strong positive catalysts in the news, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on Jim Cramer's comments. Cramer highlights concerns about Apple's heavy reliance on iPhone sales, potential downside surprises in the upcoming quarter, and the impact of the Chinese economy. He also notes that many analysts expect Apple to underperform, which could lead to bearish sentiment among investors. While Cramer advises a long-term hold strategy ('own them, don't trade them'), the immediate concerns and negative market sentiment suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), expressing concerns about the company's potential performance and its reliance on iPhone sales. Cramer's analysis suggests that Apple's stock could be a 'wildcard to the downside' and that many analysts expect the company to underperform. He also mentions that Apple's stock has been a laggard since the beginning of the year and that there are concerns about the company's ability to surprise positively in the upcoming quarter. While Cramer's long-term view of Apple is positive, his short-term concerns and the overall negative sentiment expressed in the article lead to a cautious outlook. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL), with Jim Cramer expressing concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales, potential disappointing quarter, and impact of the Chinese economy. However, he also advises investors to 'own them, don't trade them', indicating a long-term positive outlook. Considering the negative sentiment and potential downside risks mentioned by Cramer, as well as the trend of previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling as slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary expresses concerns about Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and the potential for a disappointing quarter. Despite acknowledging Apple's long-term potential, Cramer suggests that the stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that many analysts expect Apple to underperform. The overall negative tone, combined with the significant weight of past predictions indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price fall, suggests a continued downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple's vulnerability, particularly its reliance on iPhone sales and the potential negative impact of the Chinese economy. Cramer's comments suggest a bearish sentiment, indicating that many analysts expect Apple to underperform, which could lead to a decline in stock price. While he acknowledges some long-term potential, the overall tone is cautious and suggests a higher likelihood of a price drop. This aligns with previous predictions that indicate a consensus towards a bearish outlook for AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment expressed by Jim Cramer, coupled with the concerns about Apple's reliance on iPhone sales, potential for a disappointing quarter, and the impact of the Chinese economy, strongly suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous rounds of predictions also reflect this consensus, with most models assigning a higher probability to a price fall. While Cramer advises a long-term hold strategy, the immediate impact of the news and the prevailing negative sentiment are likely to outweigh any long-term optimism. Therefore, I am maintaining a high probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news piece centers on Jim Cramer's relatively negative assessment of Apple's short-term prospects. While he advocates for long-term holding, his concerns regarding iPhone sales dependence, a potentially disappointing quarter, and the influence of the Chinese economy significantly outweigh his long-term optimism in the short-term context.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple AI models in previous prediction rounds, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 probability of a price fall, reinforces this negative outlook.  Cramer's 'wildcard to the downside' comment and the widespread analyst expectation of a downside surprise further solidify the likelihood of a price drop. Although Cramer's long-term 'own, don't trade' advice might mitigate some negative impact, the immediate market reaction is likely to be bearish.  Considering the cumulative negative sentiment and the lack of compelling positive catalysts, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on Jim Cramer's comments.
