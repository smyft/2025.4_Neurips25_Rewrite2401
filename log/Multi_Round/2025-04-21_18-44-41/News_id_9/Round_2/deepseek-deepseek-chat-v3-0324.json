A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which generally reflects positive market sentiment. Additionally, the fact that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations suggests stability in the economic environment, which can lead to increased investor confidence. Given that Apple Inc. is a major player in the market, it is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates positive market sentiment with US equity indexes trading near record highs. The key driver is that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations, suggesting that the Fed may not need to aggressively raise interest rates. This is generally positive for stocks, including Apple. While the full article is behind a paywall, the headline alone suggests a favorable environment for stock prices. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes, including the one Apple is listed on, rose due to inflation meeting expectations.  This generally positive market sentiment could lift Apple's stock price. However, the news lacks specific information about Apple's performance or any direct impact on the company.  Therefore, while the overall market trend is positive, the impact on Apple is uncertain.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the positive market context, but acknowledge significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which generally bodes well for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since Apple is a major component of US equity indexes, its stock price is likely to benefit from the overall bullish trend. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's earnings or other company-specific news limits the certainty of the prediction. Given the positive market environment, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meets expectations. This generally positive economic environment could boost investor confidence. However, the specific impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the provided news content. Given that the overall market sentiment appears to be positive, with equity indexes near record highs, it is reasonable to infer that AAPL, being a major and influential company in the US stock market, could also see a positive impact. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which suggests a positive market sentiment. The fact that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations also implies stability in the economic outlook. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the US equity indexes, a rise in the overall market is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. However, the news does not specifically mention any significant developments related to Apple Inc., so the impact may be indirect and moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which suggests a positive market sentiment. Additionally, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations can be seen as a positive factor for the overall market as it reduces concerns over excessive inflation. While the news content is incomplete, it implies that positive earnings reports, such as from Apple Inc., could further support the upward trend in equity indexes. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, although the incomplete news content prevents a definitive conclusion.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which is likely to benefit major companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the news does not provide specific information about Apple's performance, the overall bullish trend in the market and the stability indicated by the inflation gauge suggest a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. Considering the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a positive outlook, I estimate a probability of 0.68 for the stock price rising and 0.32 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that the news is generally positive for the market, and therefore likely positive for Apple. The fact that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations is a key driver. While the full article is behind a paywall, the headline suggests a favorable environment. Considering the previous predictions, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, reflecting the continued positive sentiment and the consistency of the inflation data meeting expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the market, with US equity indexes near record highs due to inflation meeting expectations. This suggests a positive overall market sentiment, which should benefit Apple as a major component of these indexes.  However, the lack of specific information about Apple's performance or any direct impact on the company from the news limits the certainty of a price increase. The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 for the probability of a price rise, with a general consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a rise than a fall. Considering the positive market context and the consensus of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than the highest prediction to account for the lack of company-specific news.  The probability of a fall is correspondingly higher than the lowest prediction to reflect the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive market sentiment with US equity indexes trading near record highs, driven by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This typically bodes well for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it reflects stability and investor confidence. Previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The consensus indicates a favorable environment for AAPL, though the lack of company-specific news limits the certainty. Given the overall positive market trend and the historical performance of AAPL in such conditions, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations.

This generally bodes well for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the specific impact on Apple is not directly mentioned, the overall positive market environment and the fact that Apple is a major component of US equity indexes imply a likely positive impact on its stock price. Considering the trend of others' beliefs from previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher chance of the stock price rising, it's reasonable to estimate a moderately high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, reflecting positive market sentiment. The fact that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations suggests economic stability and reduced concerns over inflation, which can positively affect investor confidence. As Apple Inc. is a major player in the US equity market, it is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. Although the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, the overall bullish trend in the market strongly suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
