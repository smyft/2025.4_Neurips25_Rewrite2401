(AAPL) as one of those stocks. However, the mere association with Warren Buffett, known for his successful investment strategies, could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. Given that Apple is a well-established and widely followed stock, the lack of direct mention in the context of Buffett's portfolio might not necessarily imply a negative impact. The overall effect of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to the indirect endorsement by association. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
