(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

However, the company has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating potential challenges. Additionally, Apple has underperformed the industry recently, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Given these factors, the market may react cautiously, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent Seven' companies, including Apple. While the overall expectation is for strong earnings growth from the group, the specific information for Apple is mixed. Apple has a negative Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a higher likelihood of underperformance. There were no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days. The company has a history of positive earnings surprises, but weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter tempers expectations. The rollout of AI applications has not yet boosted sales. Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is a key factor influencing its stock price. The news mentions a modest year-over-year earnings increase of 8.3% and revenue growth of 3.7%, which is lower than the overall growth projected for the 'Magnificent 7'.  The negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling or remaining flat.  The lack of earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days indicates a lack of significant positive momentum. While Apple's AI initiatives are mentioned, their impact on the current quarter's results seems limited, given the focus on English-language users only. Jefferies' downgrade to underperform further adds to the negative sentiment.  The weak sales guidance provided on the last earnings call also contributes to a pessimistic outlook.  Considering all these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to report strong earnings growth. However, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential weakness. The company expects weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and has underperformed the industry with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. Despite being a market darling, the negative earnings estimate and weak sales outlook suggest cautious investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. Apple's earnings track record is strong with an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. However, the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to the weak guidance and negative ESP.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article provides information on the expected earnings growth and revenue growth for each company. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a lower chance of beating earnings expectations. The company's earnings track record is strong, but the recent downgrade by Jefferies and weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter are negative factors. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's earnings ESP is negative and they have a Zacks Rank #4, suggesting a sell rating. They have no recent earnings estimate revisions and have underperformed the industry in the past three months. While they have a strong history of positive earnings surprises, the guidance provided on the last earnings call was weak, expecting low to mid-single digit sales growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing a challenging earnings season with a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a higher likelihood of underperformance. The company has not seen any earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days, and its recent sales guidance is weak, expecting only low to mid-single digit growth. Although Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, the lack of momentum and the downgrade from Jefferies contribute to a cautious outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: Apple's situation presents a mixed bag. The negative Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) are significant red flags, suggesting a higher likelihood of underperformance. The lack of earnings estimate revisions and underperformance in the past three months further reinforce this concern. While Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, the weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and Jefferies' downgrade to underperform cannot be ignored. The AI initiatives are unlikely to significantly impact the current quarter's results. Considering the consistently negative sentiment from previous rounds, I'm maintaining a bearish outlook, but slightly less so than before, acknowledging the company's historical ability to surprise positively.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it's part of the 'Magnificent Seven' expected to show overall strong earnings, Apple's specific projections are less optimistic.  A negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), no recent earnings estimate revisions, and weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth) all point towards a higher likelihood of a price fall.  The underperformance relative to the industry (-4.6% in three months) further strengthens this negative sentiment. Although Apple has a history of positive earnings surprises, the current indicators suggest a cautious approach by investors.  The AI initiatives are mentioned, but their impact on the current quarter seems limited.  Considering the preponderance of negative factors, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although the strong historical performance and overall market sentiment for tech stocks provide a small buffer against a complete collapse.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of the 'Magnificent 7' earnings season reveals mixed signals. On the positive side, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, with an average of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. However, the company currently has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential challenges in meeting earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple has underperformed the industry recently, with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. The company's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth, further dampens optimism. The rollout of AI applications has not yet significantly boosted sales, and a recent downgrade by Jefferies adds to the negative sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential challenges. The company's earnings track record is strong, but the recent downgrade by Jefferies and weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter are negative factors. The modest year-over-year earnings increase of 8.3% and revenue growth of 3.7% are lower than the overall growth projected for the 'Magnificent 7'. The lack of significant positive momentum and negative sentiment surrounding the stock contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51% and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. Apple's earnings track record is strong with an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. However, the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. Considering these mixed signals and the overall trend of predictions from other models, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to the weak guidance and negative ESP.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s role in the 'Magnificent 7' earnings season. Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51% and it has a Zacks Rank #4, which suggests a higher likelihood of underperformance. The company has seen modest projections for earnings and revenue growth, as well as weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Additionally, the lack of recent positive revisions and the downgrade by Jefferies contribute to a cautious market sentiment.
