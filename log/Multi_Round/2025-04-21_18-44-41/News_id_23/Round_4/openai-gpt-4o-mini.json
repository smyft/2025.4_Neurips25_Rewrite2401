      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\nNews Content: The company\u2019s stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, but AI isn\u2019t driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline suggests that while there is some positive sentiment around AI news, it doesn't translate into immediate consumer behavior for Apple products, such as upgrades to iPhones. This tempered outlook may lead to uncertainty among investors, balancing out the initial stock boost from the news. Therefore, the probabilities indicate moderate optimism for a rise but also a substantial chance for a decline due to lack of immediate enthusiasm for upgrades.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a mixed impact on Apple stock. While there's a short-term boost from 'DeepSeek news' (unspecified, possibly AI-related, but positive in the short term), the main takeaway is that AI isn't currently driving significant iPhone upgrades. This implies that any positive impact from AI developments will be delayed. The lack of immediate iPhone upgrade drivers suggests potential stagnation in revenue growth for the short to medium term, which could be a negative catalyst. Therefore, while there might be a slight initial rise, the long-term implications leaning towards being negative on the price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently experiencing a boost (likely due to the unrelated 'DeepSeek' news), the actual impact of Apple's AI efforts on iPhone upgrades and consequently, stock price, is not yet significant.  This implies that the current price surge isn't directly tied to Apple's progress in AI. The absence of a major positive catalyst related to AI suggests a limited likelihood of a substantial price increase solely based on this news.  However, the market is already factoring in the excitement around AI technology, and any negative news directly related to Apple\u2019s progress in AI could lead to a slight correction. Considering the lack of a strong driver in either direction, it's more probable that the price will remain relatively stable, with a slightly higher chance of a minor correction due to the headline subtly tempering expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple's stock is receiving a boost from DeepSeek news, the AI developments are not yet driving significant upgrades to iPhones. This suggests that the immediate impact of AI on Apple's revenue and growth may be limited. However, the mention of a boost from DeepSeek news implies some positive sentiment in the market. Given this mixed information, the stock price might see modest upward movement due to positive sentiment but is unlikely to surge significantly as the AI-driven growth is not yet materializing.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's AI moment is not imminent, which may disappoint investors expecting immediate benefits from AI technology. Although the stock is getting a boost from DeepSeek news, it's not driving a rush to upgrade iPhones. This indicates a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, as the company's AI advancements are not yet translating into immediate sales or upgrades. Therefore, the stock price may not experience a significant surge due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that while Apple's stock is experiencing a boost due to AI-related news (DeepSeek), the article implies that this AI integration is not currently driving a significant upgrade rush for iPhones. This could mean that the stock price increase might be temporary or based on future potential rather than current sales or demand. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news might be lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable once the initial hype dissipates.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite some positive sentiment around Artificial Intelligence (AI) news, indicated by 'DeepSeek', the core aspect related to AI is not influencing consumer behavior towards upgrading their iPhones. This could imply that investor enthusiasm might be tempered due to the lack of immediate positive impact on sales or product adoption, which may lead to a cooling off in stock price gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that while there is a temporary boost to Apple's stock due to the DeepSeek news, there is no immediate effect on iPhone upgrades from the AI developments. This suggests that investors may feel optimistic short-term but are likely concerned about the long-term implications of not seeing a significant impact on sales. Although sentiment remains positive, the lack of a direct catalyst for growth from AI technologies might lead to a higher probability of declines as the market adjusts its expectations. Therefore, maintaining a cautious outlook appears warranted.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While there's an initial boost from 'DeepSeek' news, the core message is that AI isn't yet significantly driving iPhone upgrades. This suggests that any positive impact from AI might be delayed or less impactful in the immediate term. Considering the previous predictions, there's a trend toward slightly negative sentiment, with most models factoring in the tempered expectations surrounding Apple's AI progress. Several models emphasize the lack of immediate revenue drivers, leading to a cautiously negative outlook. The initial positive sentiments appear to be weakening based on the collective reasoning. Given this, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher, reflecting the market's potentially diminishing excitement and concern about the pace of AI adoption among consumers, as it directly impacts sales. I am setting price rise to 0.35. Price fall is increased to 0.65 to reflect market potential diminishing sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture. While Apple's stock receives a short-term boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news, the core message is that AI's impact on iPhone sales is not yet significant.  This lack of immediate, AI-driven revenue growth is a potential negative for investors.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation.  The fact that the DeepSeek news is driving the initial boost suggests that this positive impact is likely temporary and unrelated to Apple's long-term AI strategy.  Therefore, while a slight price increase might persist due to the initial positive sentiment, the underlying message about the lack of significant impact from AI progress makes a price fall more likely in the medium term, outweighing the short term gains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content reveal a mixed impact on Apple's stock. While there is a short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek news' (likely AI-related), the core message is that AI advancements are not yet driving iPhone upgrades, which could dampen investor enthusiasm. Previous predictions show varied opinions, but the majority indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations regarding immediate revenue growth from AI. Given the lack of a strong positive catalyst and the potential for a correction as initial hype fades, the stock is more likely to experience downward pressure in the near term. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than that of a rise, albeit moderately so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still distant, which could temper immediate investor enthusiasm. While the stock is getting a boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news, the lack of AI-driven iPhone upgrades indicates that the positive impact on stock price may be limited. The mixed sentiment and tempered expectations suggest a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling or remaining stable rather than surging. Considering the predictions from various models, there is a general cautiousness with a slight leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still in the future, implying that the current boost in stock price from DeepSeek news may not be sustainable. The lack of immediate impact on iPhone upgrades indicates a tempered outlook, which may lead to uncertainty among investors. Considering the mixed analysis from previous models, with some predicting a higher likelihood of a rise and others a fall, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards caution. The initial boost may wear off as investors realize the AI-driven growth is not materializing immediately. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than that of falling, reflecting the cautious stance due to the delayed impact of AI on iPhone sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that while Apple's stock is experiencing a boost from DeepSeek news, the core impact of AI on driving immediate upgrades for iPhones is not significant. Several previous predictions indicate a mix of modest optimism and caution, suggesting that the initial boost may be short-lived. The lack of immediate consumer impact on iPhone upgrades points towards potentially moderate but cautious market reaction. Overall, there is a sense of tempered expectations given the news content.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news suggests that while Apple is experiencing a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news related to AI, the immediate impact on iPhone upgrades from AI developments is lacking. This could lead to uncertainty among investors, causing them to temper their expectations for sustained growth driven by AI. Previous predictions reflect a consensus that leans towards a cautious outlook, with many models indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling due to a lack of immediate revenue catalysts and the mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's AI advancements. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling as the market adjusts to these tempered expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that while there's an initial boost from 'DeepSeek' news, the lack of immediate impact on iPhone upgrades due to AI is a concern. Most models have decreased the probability of a rise and increased the probability of a fall in Round 1 compared to Round 0. This suggests a growing negative consensus as the lack of immediate AI-driven revenue becomes more salient. I will slightly increase the probability of fall to reflect this trend. The boost is considered temporary, while the lack of significant AI-driven upgrades raises concerns about future growth. There is a generally cautious outlook, so I will weigh the sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a short-term boost exists due to unrelated 'DeepSeek' news, the core message highlights the lack of significant AI-driven iPhone upgrades. This suggests the positive impact is temporary and not tied to Apple's long-term AI strategy.  The consensus among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation.  The absence of immediate revenue drivers from AI, combined with the potentially temporary nature of the DeepSeek boost, outweighs any short-term optimism.  The consistent downward trend in the probability of a price rise across multiple rounds of predictions further reinforces this cautious outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a mixed impact on Apple's stock. While there is a short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek news' (likely AI-related), the core message is that AI advancements are not yet driving iPhone upgrades, which could dampen investor enthusiasm. Previous predictions from various models show a trend towards cautious or negative sentiment, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations regarding immediate revenue growth from AI. The initial positive sentiment from the DeepSeek news appears to be temporary and unrelated to Apple's long-term AI strategy, making a price fall more likely in the medium term. Therefore, the probability of a fall is higher than that of a rise, albeit moderately so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that while Apple's stock is experiencing a boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news, the actual impact of AI on driving iPhone upgrades is not yet significant. This mixed sentiment indicates that the initial positive reaction may be short-lived as investors realize the delayed impact of AI on Apple's revenue growth. The majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling or remaining stable due to tempered expectations. Given this context, it seems prudent to estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests a mixed sentiment regarding the impact of AI on Apple's stock price. While the company is experiencing a temporary boost due to DeepSeek news, the lack of immediate effect on iPhone upgrades from AI developments indicates tempered expectations. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which show a trend towards cautiousness with a slight leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards caution. The initial boost may wear off as investors realize the AI-driven growth is not materializing immediately. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that while Apple's stock is experiencing a temporary boost from DeepSeek news, the impact on actual consumer behavior and revenues from AI-driven iPhone upgrades remains limited. Multiple predictions show a consistent trend of higher probabilities of the stock price falling or remaining stable. This indicates a cautious market sentiment due to the lack of immediate tangible benefits from AI technology on Apple's sales. Therefore, considering the mixed signals and predominantly cautious assessments, it is prudent to assign a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple's stock receives a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, the core message is that AI is not yet significantly driving iPhone upgrades. This suggests that any positive sentiment may be short-lived and that investor enthusiasm could be tempered due to the lack of immediate revenue catalysts. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting cautious sentiment in the market. Overall, the immediate impact from AI advancements appears limited and not a strong enough driver for sustained stock price increases, leading to an estimation of a higher probability of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The core message from the news and previous analyses is that despite a temporary boost from 'DeepSeek' news, AI isn't yet driving iPhone upgrades, a crucial revenue stream for Apple. The consistent trend across multiple rounds of predictions shows a decreasing probability of a price rise and an increasing probability of a price fall. This indicates a growing market concern about the delayed impact of AI on Apple's sales and revenue. Therefore, placing more emphasized on the market expectations and previous analysis, the likelihood of a stock price fall remains notably higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While there's a short-term boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news, the core message is that AI isn't significantly driving iPhone upgrades. This suggests the positive impact is temporary and not tied to Apple's long-term AI strategy.  The consensus among previous predictions leans strongly towards a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation. The absence of immediate revenue drivers from AI, combined with the potentially temporary nature of the DeepSeek boost, outweighs any short-term optimism.  The consistent downward trend in the probability of a price rise across multiple rounds of predictions further reinforces this cautious outlook.  The lack of a clear catalyst from the AI news, coupled with the predominantly negative sentiment from the AI models, suggests a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' indicates a mixed sentiment for Apple's stock. While there is a short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek news' (likely AI-related), the core message is that AI advancements are not yet driving iPhone upgrades, which could dampen investor enthusiasm. Previous predictions from various models show a trend towards cautious or negative sentiment, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to tempered expectations regarding immediate revenue growth from AI.

This mixed sentiment indicates that the initial positive reaction may be short-lived as investors realize the delayed impact of AI on Apple's revenue growth. The consensus from previous predictions leans towards a cautious outlook, with many models indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling due to a lack of immediate revenue catalysts and tempered expectations surrounding Apple's AI advancements. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests a mixed sentiment regarding the impact of AI on Apple's stock price. While the company is experiencing a temporary boost due to DeepSeek news, the lack of immediate effect on iPhone upgrades from AI developments indicates tempered expectations.
