      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\nNews Content: The company\u2019s stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, but AI isn\u2019t driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline suggests that while there is some positive sentiment around AI news, it doesn't translate into immediate consumer behavior for Apple products, such as upgrades to iPhones. This tempered outlook may lead to uncertainty among investors, balancing out the initial stock boost from the news. Therefore, the probabilities indicate moderate optimism for a rise but also a substantial chance for a decline due to lack of immediate enthusiasm for upgrades.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a mixed impact on Apple stock. While there's a short-term boost from 'DeepSeek news' (unspecified, possibly AI-related, but positive in the short term), the main takeaway is that AI isn't currently driving significant iPhone upgrades. This implies that any positive impact from AI developments will be delayed. The lack of immediate iPhone upgrade drivers suggests potential stagnation in revenue growth for the short to medium term, which could be a negative catalyst. Therefore, while there might be a slight initial rise, the long-term implications leaning towards being negative on the price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently experiencing a boost (likely due to the unrelated 'DeepSeek' news), the actual impact of Apple's AI efforts on iPhone upgrades and consequently, stock price, is not yet significant.  This implies that the current price surge isn't directly tied to Apple's progress in AI. The absence of a major positive catalyst related to AI suggests a limited likelihood of a substantial price increase solely based on this news.  However, the market is already factoring in the excitement around AI technology, and any negative news directly related to Apple\u2019s progress in AI could lead to a slight correction. Considering the lack of a strong driver in either direction, it's more probable that the price will remain relatively stable, with a slightly higher chance of a minor correction due to the headline subtly tempering expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple's stock is receiving a boost from DeepSeek news, the AI developments are not yet driving significant upgrades to iPhones. This suggests that the immediate impact of AI on Apple's revenue and growth may be limited. However, the mention of a boost from DeepSeek news implies some positive sentiment in the market. Given this mixed information, the stock price might see modest upward movement due to positive sentiment but is unlikely to surge significantly as the AI-driven growth is not yet materializing.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's AI moment is not imminent, which may disappoint investors expecting immediate benefits from AI technology. Although the stock is getting a boost from DeepSeek news, it's not driving a rush to upgrade iPhones. This indicates a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, as the company's AI advancements are not yet translating into immediate sales or upgrades. Therefore, the stock price may not experience a significant surge due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that while Apple's stock is experiencing a boost due to AI-related news (DeepSeek), the article implies that this AI integration is not currently driving a significant upgrade rush for iPhones. This could mean that the stock price increase might be temporary or based on future potential rather than current sales or demand. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news might be lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable once the initial hype dissipates.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite some positive sentiment around Artificial Intelligence (AI) news, indicated by 'DeepSeek', the core aspect related to AI is not influencing consumer behavior towards upgrading their iPhones. This could imply that investor enthusiasm might be tempered due to the lack of immediate positive impact on sales or product adoption, which may lead to a cooling off in stock price gains.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While there's an initial boost from 'DeepSeek' news, the core message is that AI isn't yet significantly driving iPhone upgrades. This suggests that any positive impact from AI might be delayed or less impactful in the immediate term. Considering the previous predictions, there's a trend toward slightly negative sentiment, with most models factoring in the tempered expectations surrounding Apple's AI progress. Several models emphasize the lack of immediate revenue drivers, leading to a cautiously negative outlook. The initial positive sentiments appear to be weakening based on the collective reasoning. Given this, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher, reflecting the market's potentially diminishing excitement and concern about the pace of AI adoption among consumers, as it directly impacts sales. I am setting price rise to 0.35. Price fall is increased to 0.65 to reflect market potential diminishing sentiment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```"
