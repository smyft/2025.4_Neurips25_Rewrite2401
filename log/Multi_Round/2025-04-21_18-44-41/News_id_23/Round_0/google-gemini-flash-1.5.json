This implies that the current price surge isn't directly tied to Apple's progress in AI. The absence of a major positive catalyst related to AI suggests a limited likelihood of a substantial price increase solely based on this news.  However, the market is already factoring in the excitement around AI technology, and any negative news directly related to Apple\u2019s progress in AI could lead to a slight correction. Considering the lack of a strong driver in either direction, it's more probable that the price will remain relatively stable, with a slightly higher chance of a minor correction due to the headline subtly tempering expectations.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
