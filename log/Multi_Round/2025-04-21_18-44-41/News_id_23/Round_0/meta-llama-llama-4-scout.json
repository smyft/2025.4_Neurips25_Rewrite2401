Although the stock is getting a boost from DeepSeek news, it's not driving a rush to upgrade iPhones. This indicates a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, as the company's AI advancements are not yet translating into immediate sales or upgrades. Therefore, the stock price may not experience a significant surge due to this news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```\n\nIn this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is 0.4 (or 40%), while the probability of it falling is 0.6 (or 60%). The reasoning is that the news does not provide a strong catalyst for the stock price to increase, as Apple's AI moment is still a ways off, and the company's current AI advancements are not driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones."
