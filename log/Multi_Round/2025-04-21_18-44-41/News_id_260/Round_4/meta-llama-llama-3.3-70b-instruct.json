(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and the implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. If TikTok is banned, Apple may face a decline in app store revenue from TikTok, which could negatively impact its stock price. However, if the situation resolves favorably for TikTok, it could stabilize or even boost investor confidence in Apple. Given the mixed signals and potential for regulatory changes, the probabilities of stock price movement are relatively balanced, but with a slight inclination towards a fall due to the immediate negative implications of the ban.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. While Apple is mentioned as one of the companies required to remove TikTok from its app store if the ban proceeds, the overall impact on Apple's business is likely to be limited. Apple's revenue streams are diverse, and the removal of TikTok, while potentially impacting user experience for some, is unlikely to significantly affect its financial performance. The uncertainty surrounding the ban, potential delays, and possible solutions (sale, executive order) further dilute the direct impact on Apple. The article also mentions Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle, indicating that the impact is spread across multiple tech giants. Therefore, the news is more of a general tech industry concern than a specific negative catalyst for Apple. Given the uncertainty and the relatively small direct impact, the stock price movement is likely to be muted. However, a slight negative sentiment is possible due to the association with a potentially controversial app ban.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a US law banning TikTok from US app stores and cloud services unless it's sold to a non-foreign adversary by January 19th.  Apple is directly implicated as it would be required to remove TikTok from its app store.  While the article highlights potential delays or reversals (Trump's involvement, potential buyers), the immediate risk is the removal of TikTok, which could negatively impact Apple's App Store revenue.  The uncertainty surrounding the situation adds volatility.  However, the potential for a resolution (sale, delay) before the deadline mitigates the negative impact.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, the probabilities are assigned as follows.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S. and its implications for tech giants like Apple. Apple's stock price could be impacted in several ways. On one hand, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to a decrease in revenue from app downloads and in-app purchases, which might negatively affect Apple's stock. On the other hand, the enforcement of the ban could be delayed or altered by political actions, potentially minimizing the immediate impact. Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but lean slightly towards a negative impact due to the potential revenue loss.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other tech companies has mixed implications for Apple's stock price. On one hand, the ban of TikTok could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of other social media and tech companies, which might not directly impact Apple's business but could affect the broader market. On the other hand, if TikTok is forced to shut down or divest its US operations, it might not have a significant impact on Apple's business as TikTok is not a major contributor to Apple's revenue. However, the uncertainty and potential disruption to the app ecosystem could lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence. The law requires TikTok's app stores to remove the app, but it does not directly affect Apple's core business. The company's stock price might experience a minor fluctuation due to the overall market sentiment and potential regulatory implications for tech companies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on tech giants like Apple. The ban would require Apple to remove TikTok from its app store, which could lead to a loss of revenue for the company. However, the article also mentions that the ban's enforcement is uncertain and may be delayed or overturned by the incoming Trump administration. Additionally, the ban's impact on Apple's stock price may be limited, as the company has a diverse range of products and services. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, but the uncertainty surrounding the ban's enforcement and the company's diversified business reduce the likelihood of a significant stock price drop.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app due to regulatory issues, which may affect its availability on Apple's App Store. While the news primarily impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it could indirectly influence Apple's stock price if the situation leads to public concern or regulatory scrutiny affecting the broader tech sector. However, Apple itself is not directly involved in the sale or divestiture of TikTok, and the company's core business of hardware and software ecosystems remains intact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US creates uncertainty for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it may have to remove TikTok from its App Store, which could lead to a decline in app store revenue. While the immediate impact on Apple's core business may be limited due to its diverse revenue streams, the uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the ban and the potential for regulatory scrutiny could negatively affect investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, I estimate a higher probability of stock price falling due to the immediate implications of the ban and the uncertainty it introduces.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple.

While Apple would need to remove TikTok from its App Store, the financial impact is likely to be small compared to Apple's overall revenue.  The diverse revenue streams of Apple significantly mitigate the risk. The uncertainty surrounding the ban's enforcement, potential delays, and the possibility of a last-minute resolution (sale, executive order) further reduce the likelihood of a significant stock price movement.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall, but the reasoning often highlights the limited direct impact on Apple. Considering the overall uncertainty and the relatively small direct impact, the stock price movement is likely to be muted.  The potential for a negative market sentiment due to the broader tech industry implications is a factor, but not a dominant one given Apple's size and diversification.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple.

While the primary focus is on TikTok, the news indicates that Apple could be directly affected if TikTok must be removed from the App Store. The uncertain nature of the outcome and potential for delays or resolutions means that the impact could be mitigated.
