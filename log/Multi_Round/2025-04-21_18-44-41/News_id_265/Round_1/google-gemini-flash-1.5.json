A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential regulatory environment under the incoming Trump administration. While Nvidia's advancements may positively influence the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple Inc. is less clear. However, the mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration suggests a stable environment for major tech companies. Given the overall positive sentiment towards AI advancements and the potential for reduced regulation, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price may rise. Conversely, concerns about semiconductor regulations could negatively impact the sector, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia (NVDA) and its new AI safety tools. While positive for Nvidia, the article mentions Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration, suggesting potential positive relationships with the new administration. Trump is expected to bring less regulation, which could benefit Apple. However, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's core business. The overall sentiment is slightly positive for Apple, but the impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.  While Nvidia's advancements are positive for the company, the news piece doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price.  The mention of Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is purely contextual and doesn't provide any insight into Apple's financial prospects. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this specific news is considered negligible. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration, with only a tangential mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the Big Tech leaders attending the event. There is no direct impact on Apple's business operations or financial performance mentioned in the article. However, the broader context of potential semiconductor regulations and tariffs under the new administration could indirectly affect Apple, given its reliance on global supply chains. The lack of specific negative or positive news about Apple suggests minimal immediate impact on its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Nvidia unveiling AI safety tools and Jensen Huang missing Trump's inauguration due to an East Asia tour does not directly indicate a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, as a major tech company, Apple's stock movement can be influenced by broader tech industry trends and regulatory environments. The news about Nvidia and its impact on the tech industry doesn't directly relate to Apple's core business or recent performance. Given that the news isn't specifically about Apple or its products, it's unlikely to cause a significant immediate stock price movement for AAPL based on this information alone. The focus on Nvidia's advancements and Jensen Huang's attendance at Trump's inauguration might imply a neutral or slightly positive outlook for tech stocks in general due to potential advancements in AI and safety measures, but it's not directly impactful on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools to boost enterprise trust, which is a positive development for the company. Additionally, the article mentions that Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expects less regulation under the Trump administration, which could be beneficial for the company. However, the article also mentions concerns about potential tariffs on Mexico and China, which could negatively impact Nvidia. Since the news is more positive than negative, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. The fact that big tech giants, including Apple's Tim Cook, will attend the inauguration, while Nvidia's CEO will not, is neutral news and does not significantly impact the stock price. The launch of Nvidia's AI safety tools and the company's recent stock surge are more significant factors in determining the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and the absence of Nvidia's CEO from Trump's inauguration. The content suggests a positive outlook on Nvidia's AI developments which could positively impact investor sentiment towards AI-focused companies. However, there is no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any specific impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the news might indirectly influence AAPL's stock price if investors shift focus towards AI and semiconductor technology stocks. But there is no clear indication of a direct effect on AAPL.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
