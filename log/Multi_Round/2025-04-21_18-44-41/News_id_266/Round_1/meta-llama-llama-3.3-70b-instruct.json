(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Microsoft\u2019s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Microsoft and its challenges with AI adoption, which may indirectly affect Apple due to the competitive landscape in technology. Apple's recent 4% drop indicates market concerns about its performance, particularly in iPhone sales and the Chinese market. Given the overall tech sector's mixed performance and the specific pressures on Apple, there is a higher probability of its stock price falling. However, the slight recovery on Friday suggests some resilience. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their potential impact on its stock. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple (AAPL), it mentions Apple's recent stock performance and challenges. Apple's stock fell 4% on Thursday due to concerns about iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, but rose 1.3% on Friday. The overall tech market sentiment, as reflected in the Nasdaq 100 performance, is also relevant. Given the negative pressure on Apple due to iPhone sales and China, but a slight recovery on Friday, the probability of a further fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term. The article does not provide any information that would lead to a significant rise in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Microsoft's struggles with AI adoption and its impact on their stock price.  It does *not* directly relate to Apple. While the article is included in a larger Bloomberg report that also mentions Apple's recent 4% drop (its largest since August) due to concerns about iPhone sales and the Chinese market, the core news is about Microsoft.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement based on *this specific news article* is largely unaffected.  Any price movement in Apple would be attributed to the previously mentioned factors (iPhone sales, Chinese market weakness) and not the Microsoft AI news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Microsoft's AI investments and its impact on its stock performance, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its recent stock drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given that the main focus of the news is Microsoft and not Apple, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news is limited. The mention of Apple's stock falling 4% on Thursday and being down nearly 8% year-to-date suggests ongoing negative sentiment, but the news itself does not provide new significant negative or positive information about Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content focus on Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the challenges it faces in showing growth from these investments. The news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, as both companies are major players in the tech industry, developments in the sector can have indirect implications. Apple's recent stock performance has been under pressure due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. The news about Microsoft's AI investments and its impact on the stock does not provide direct insight into Apple's operations or future performance. Given the lack of direct connection between the news and Apple's core business, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. However, as the tech sector is highly interconnected, any broader implications for the industry could indirectly affect Apple's stock. The probabilities are estimated based on the indirect implications and general market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Microsoft's struggles with its AI investments and the impact on its stock pricer, the c. Howeveompany remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street, with over 90% of analysts recommending buying the stock. The article also mentions that Microsoft is expected to grow its revenue by 14% this fiscal year, with earnings expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. Although the article briefly mentions Apple's stock performance, the main focus is on Microsoft. Given the positive outlook from analysts and the expected growth, I estimate a higher probability of Microsoft's stock price rising. However, since the article is not directly about Apple, I will provide a prediction for Apple's stock price movement based on the brief mention of its performance. The article states that Apple's stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, which may indicate a lower probability of its stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Microsoft's struggle with its stock price due to ambitious AI investments and slower-than-expected AI service adoption. This suggests current market skepticism towards the company's ability to quickly show returns on their AI spending. However, there's optimism from Wall Street analysts who believe in the long-term potential of AI adoption, despite the recent challenges.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
