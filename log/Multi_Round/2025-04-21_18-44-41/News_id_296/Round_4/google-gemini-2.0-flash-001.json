(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's struggle to maintain market share amidst increasing competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers, and the impact of new U.S. regulations on AI technology exports. While the company is attempting to leverage AI to regain market share, the current sentiment around its performance and the mixed reception of its latest products suggest a bearish outlook. The restrictions on AI chip exports may also hinder Apple's ability to innovate and compete effectively in the AI space. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to these challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The US government's AI chip export restrictions could indirectly benefit Apple by hindering Chinese competitors. However, the uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's AI policies adds volatility. The article highlights Apple's recent market share loss and the underwhelming response to its AI suite, particularly in China. While Apple is striving to improve its AI offerings, the article suggests other AI stocks may offer better returns. Overall, the negative aspects seem to outweigh the potential positives in the short term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is losing market share, particularly in China due to a lack of competitive AI offerings, the article also highlights the potential for Apple to regain market share through future AI developments.  The new US government regulations on AI chip exports are a wildcard. While they aim to bolster US AI leadership, the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and ability to compete globally is unclear, especially given the incoming administration's stated intention to change the regulations. The article itself is somewhat bearish on Apple's AI prospects relative to other companies, suggesting that other AI stocks might offer better returns.  The fact that Apple is ranked only 2nd on their list of important AI news and ratings further supports this.  However, Apple's overall market position and brand strength are significant factors that could mitigate the negative impacts. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty surrounding the future AI regulations, the probabilities are assigned cautiously.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the U.S. government's new regulations on AI chip exports could benefit U.S. companies by maintaining technological leadership, potentially aiding Apple's AI initiatives. However, the article also notes Apple's struggle with market share loss due to underwhelming upgrades and competitive pressure from Chinese Android device makers. Additionally, Apple's AI suite is not available in China, which is a significant market. The mixed response to the iPhone 16 series and the lack of immediate AI availability at launch further complicate the outlook. Overall, the news presents a balanced mix of challenges and opportunities for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in regaining market share in 2025 with the help of AI. It mentions Apple's underwhelming upgrades and competitors leading to a loss in market share in the final quarter of 2024. The article also highlights the US government's new regulations on AI chip exports, which could impact Apple's AI development and market performance. However, it does not provide a direct positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed response to Apple's iPhone 16 series and the company's efforts to partner with local players for AI features, there is a cautious outlook. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.45 due to potential long-term AI benefits, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.55 due to short-term market share struggles and regulatory uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the US government's restrictions on AI chip and technology exports, which may impact Apple's ability to regain market share in 2025. The company has been struggling with underwhelming upgrades and losing market share to Android device makers from China. However, the article also mentions that Apple is striving to partner with local players to provide AI features, which could potentially help the company regain market share. Considering the mixed response to Apple's iPhone 16 series and the lack of availability of Apple Intelligence in China, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. Nevertheless, the company's efforts to develop its AI capabilities and expand its presence in non-core markets like Latin America could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights several challenges for Apple Inc., including market share losses, restrictions on AI chip exports, and increased competition from Chinese Android device makers. Despite the company's strong presence in non-core markets, the current regulatory environment and competitive pressures suggest near-term headwinds. While Apple has significant resources, the immediate impact of these factors could lead to a decline in investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including a loss of market share to competitors, particularly in China, and the impact of new U.S. regulations on AI chip exports. While there is potential for Apple to leverage AI to regain market share, the immediate outlook appears bearish due to underwhelming product responses and increased competition. The mixed reception of the iPhone 16 series and the uncertainty surrounding future AI policies under the incoming administration further contribute to a cautious sentiment. Overall, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term due to these challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to market share losses, competition from Chinese manufacturers, and uncertainties surrounding AI regulations. The news highlights Apple's struggles in the AI space, particularly in China, and the mixed reception of its products. While the U.S. government's AI chip export restrictions could potentially benefit U.S. companies, the incoming Trump administration's stance on AI adds volatility. Given the consistent negative sentiment and the challenges Apple faces, I am maintaining a bearish outlook, but slightly less so than the most bearish prediction from the previous round, acknowledging Apple's brand strength and potential for long-term AI development.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the US AI chip export restrictions could potentially benefit Apple by hindering Chinese competitors in the long run, the short-term impact is uncertain and could negatively affect Apple's supply chain and AI development.  Apple's recent market share loss and the underwhelming reception of its AI offerings, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, are significant concerns.  The incoming Trump administration's potential reversal of current AI policies adds further uncertainty.  Although Apple possesses strong brand recognition and resources, the immediate challenges outweigh the potential long-term benefits based on the provided information.  The previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, which aligns with my assessment.  Considering the overall negative sentiment and uncertainty, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the U.S. government's new regulations on AI chip exports could benefit U.S. companies, including Apple, by maintaining technological leadership.

The news also indicates that Apple's AI suite isn't fully competitive, particularly in key markets like China. Despite Apple's strong brand and presence in non-core markets, the immediate impact of these factors could lead to a decline in investor confidence.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including a loss of market share to competitors, particularly in China, and the impact of new U.S. regulations on AI chip exports.
