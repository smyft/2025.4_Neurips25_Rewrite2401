This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital indicates a cautious outlook on the overall market, with concerns about high valuations and disappointing data regarding Apple. The mention of Apple being highlighted as a top holding suggests some confidence, but the overall sentiment leans towards caution, especially with a recent significant drop in its stock price. The mixed signals from the report, combined with the broader market concerns, lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Greenlight Capital holds Apple, indicating some confidence. However, they express concern about overall market valuation and believe AI stocks offer better and faster returns. The article also mentions a recent one-month return of -13.59% for Apple, which is a negative signal. While the 52-week gain of 15.28% is positive, the fund's preference for AI stocks and the recent negative performance suggest potential downward pressure. The decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 also indicates a potential shift in sentiment. The mention of 'disappointing data' and 'expensive stock' further supports a cautious outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Greenlight Capital, while holding Apple, expresses concerns about overall market valuation and prefers AI stocks.  Their lower-than-average market exposure and the mention of Apple being 'pretty expensive' (from a cited source) suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Although Apple's revenue showed growth, the hedge fund's reduced position and preference for AI investments outweigh the positive revenue news. The one-month return of -13.59% further supports a negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the near term, based on this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the following key points from the news: 1) Greenlight Capital's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in 2024, indicating a cautious stance. 2) Apple's recent one-month return was -13.59%, suggesting short-term weakness. 3) Greenlight Capital's concern about market valuations and Apple being labeled as 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles. 4) A decline in hedge fund holdings of Apple from 184 to 158 in the third quarter, signaling reduced institutional confidence. 5) The mention of AI stocks as more promising investments, potentially diverting interest from Apple. These factors collectively suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's continued concern about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock is 'pretty expensive'. This could lead to a cautious or negative outlook for the stock. However, the article also mentions that 158 hedge fund portfolios held AAPL at the end of the third quarter, indicating ongoing interest. The one-month return was -13.59%, but the stock gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling due to the noted concerns about valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's update on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in its fourth-quarter 2024 investor letter. The letter expresses concern about the overall valuation of the market and mentions that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple's one-month return was -13.59% and its shares gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Considering this information, the negative sentiment towards Apple's valuation and the recent decline in its stock price suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the fact that Apple is a well-established company with a strong market presence and a large number of hedge funds holding its stock (158 hedge fund portfolios) suggests that the probability of the stock price rising is not negligible.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Greenlight Capital's investor letter highlights concerns about the overall market valuation and mentions that Apple's stock is 'Pretty Expensive.' The one-month return of AAPL is negative (-13.59%), and the fund's conviction lies more in AI stocks. While the company's revenue growth is positive, the overall sentiment from Greenlight Capital suggests a cautious approach towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a cautious outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about high market valuations and describing Apple's stock as 'pretty expensive.' The recent one-month return of -13.59% indicates short-term weakness, and the decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 suggests reduced institutional confidence. While Apple has shown a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks, the overall sentiment leans towards bearish due to the emphasis on AI stocks as more promising investments. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling. This is primarily driven by Greenlight Capital's cautious outlook on market valuations, the perception that Apple is 'expensive,' and the fund's preference for AI stocks. The negative one-month return further reinforces this sentiment. While Apple remains a popular stock among hedge funds and has shown revenue growth, the prevailing concerns about valuation and the shift towards AI investments suggest continued downward pressure. The consistency in predictions across various models in the previous round strengthens the case for a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Greenlight Capital, a significant investor, still holds AAPL, their expressed concerns about overall market valuation and their preference for AI stocks over AAPL suggest a bearish undercurrent.  The negative one-month return (-13.59%) and the characterization of AAPL as 'pretty expensive' further support this negative sentiment. Although Apple's revenue is up and it remains a holding for many hedge funds, the weight of the negative factors, particularly the explicit preference for AI investments and valuation concerns, outweighs the positive signals.  The consensus among previous models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the possibility of a rise given Apple's overall strength and continued institutional interest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) reveals a mixed sentiment. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a top holding by Greenlight Capital, and it has shown a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks. However, the fund expresses concerns about the overall market valuation, labels Apple's stock as 'pretty expensive,' and shows a preference for AI stocks, which could divert investment away from Apple. Additionally, the one-month return of -13.59% and a decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 in the third quarter indicate weakening institutional confidence. Given these factors, the negative aspects outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and specifically mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock is 'pretty expensive'. The recent one-month return of Apple was -13.59%, and despite a 52-week gain of 15.28%, the fund's preference for AI stocks over Apple suggests a cautious outlook. Additionally, there was a decline in hedge fund holdings of Apple from 184 to 158 in the third quarter. These factors collectively indicate a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the near term, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital indicates a cautious outlook on the overall market, with concerns about high valuations and disappointing data regarding Apple.

The mixed signals from the report, combined with the broader market concerns and the preference for AI stocks, lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise. Considering the analysis from other models, which also suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the near term due to its 'pretty expensive' valuation, recent negative performance, and reduced hedge fund holdings, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Greenlight Capital continues to hold Apple, they express concerns about the overall valuation of the market and describe Apple as 'pretty expensive.' Apple's one-month return is negative, and there is a reduction in hedge fund holdings. Despite the positive long-term growth and its strong market presence, the current sentiment and recent underperformance contribute to a cautious outlook. The majority of previous predictions indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital presents a cautious outlook on Apple Inc.

The combination of these factors leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from Greenlight Capital's Q4 2024 investor letter, as well as the consensus from previous rounds of predictions, leans towards a cautious, if not bearish, outlook on Apple (AAPL). While Greenlight Capital holds Apple, their concerns about overall market valuation, the perception that Apple is 'pretty expensive,' and their preference for AI stocks over Apple suggest potential downward pressure. The negative one-month return of -13.59% further reinforces this sentiment. The decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 also indicates a potential shift in sentiment.

The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple models strengthens the prediction of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc.
