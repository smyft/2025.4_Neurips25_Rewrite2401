A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital indicates a cautious outlook on the overall market, with concerns about high valuations and disappointing data regarding Apple. The mention of Apple being highlighted as a top holding suggests some confidence, but the overall sentiment leans towards caution, especially with a recent significant drop in its stock price. The mixed signals from the report, combined with the broader market concerns, lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Greenlight Capital holds Apple, indicating some confidence. However, they express concern about overall market valuation and believe AI stocks offer better and faster returns. The article also mentions a recent one-month return of -13.59% for Apple, which is a negative signal. While the 52-week gain of 15.28% is positive, the fund's preference for AI stocks and the recent negative performance suggest potential downward pressure. The decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 also indicates a potential shift in sentiment. The mention of 'disappointing data' and 'expensive stock' further supports a cautious outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Greenlight Capital, while holding Apple, expresses concerns about overall market valuation and prefers AI stocks.  Their lower-than-average market exposure and the mention of Apple being 'pretty expensive' (from a cited source) suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Although Apple's revenue showed growth, the hedge fund's reduced position and preference for AI investments outweigh the positive revenue news. The one-month return of -13.59% further supports a negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the near term, based on this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the following key points from the news: 1) Greenlight Capital's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in 2024, indicating a cautious stance. 2) Apple's recent one-month return was -13.59%, suggesting short-term weakness. 3) Greenlight Capital's concern about market valuations and Apple being labeled as 'pretty expensive' by Dan Niles. 4) A decline in hedge fund holdings of Apple from 184 to 158 in the third quarter, signaling reduced institutional confidence. 5) The mention of AI stocks as more promising investments, potentially diverting interest from Apple. These factors collectively suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's continued concern about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock is 'pretty expensive'. This could lead to a cautious or negative outlook for the stock. However, the article also mentions that 158 hedge fund portfolios held AAPL at the end of the third quarter, indicating ongoing interest. The one-month return was -13.59%, but the stock gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling due to the noted concerns about valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's update on Apple Inc.

Additionally, the article highlights that Apple's one-month return was -13.59% and its shares gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Considering this information, the negative sentiment towards Apple's valuation and the recent decline in its stock price suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the fact that Apple is a well-established company with a strong market presence and a large number of hedge funds holding its stock (158 hedge fund portfolios) suggests that the probability of the stock price rising is not negligible.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Greenlight Capital's investor letter highlights concerns about the overall market valuation and mentions that Apple's stock is 'Pretty Expensive.' The one-month return of AAPL is negative (-13.59%), and the fund's conviction lies more in AI stocks.
