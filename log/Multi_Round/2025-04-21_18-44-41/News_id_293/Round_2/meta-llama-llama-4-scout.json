(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

This suggests that Apple is in a solid financial position to manage its debt obligations, which is likely to instill confidence among investors. Additionally, the increase in EBIT and robust free cash flow further supports the notion that Apple can handle its liabilities effectively. Given these positive indicators, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management.

Key positive indicators include a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and strong free cash flow generation. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. While the article acknowledges potential risks outside the balance sheet, the overall tone suggests financial stability and prudent debt utilization.

Any price movement would likely be driven by other factors, such as broader market trends or specific product announcements. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, noting that its net debt is manageable relative to its massive market capitalization and strong earnings.

The increase in EBIT and robust free cash flow further supports the notion that Apple can handle its liabilities effectively.

Key indicators such as a low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. Considering the previous predictions leaning towards a positive outlook and the overall positive sentiment in the news, I believe the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. However, given the inherent uncertainties in the market and the potential for unforeseen events, I will adjust the probability slightly downwards from the previous round's average to reflect a more balanced perspective.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, highlighting a low net debt to EBITDA ratio (0.31), high interest coverage (673x), and strong free cash flow generation (90% of EBIT).

However, the information presented is largely consistent with existing market perceptions of Apple's financial strength.  Therefore, while the news is unlikely to cause a significant price drop, a substantial price increase is also unlikely in the short term.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, but none strongly suggesting a dramatic movement.  Considering the generally positive but not overwhelmingly bullish nature of the news, and the lack of any significant new information, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, with a relatively low probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, showcasing a low net debt to EBITDA ratio (0.31) and a high interest coverage ratio (673x), indicating strong financial health.

Given these positive indicators, the market is likely to react favorably, reducing perceived risk and potentially driving the stock price higher. However, the impact may be moderate as the information aligns with existing market perceptions of Apple's financial strength. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with most estimates between 0.65 and 0.7.
