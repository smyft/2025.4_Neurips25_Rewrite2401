(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The mention of Apple's potential for future growth through AI integration and the solid financial performance in recent quarters suggests a positive outlook. Given Buffett's endorsement and the company's fundamentals, there is a high probability that the stock price will rise. However, the market can be unpredictable, and there is always a chance of volatility, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and identifies Apple as a key holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. It emphasizes Apple's strong brand loyalty, growing customer base, and successful services business. The article also mentions the potential for Apple Intelligence to drive future growth. While the article acknowledges that the stock has become expensive, it suggests a dollar-cost averaging approach. Overall, the news is positive for Apple, suggesting long-term growth potential and stability due to Buffett's endorsement. However, the article also mentions that the stock is expensive, which could limit short-term gains. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a general advertisement and not specific to Apple, so it has a limited impact on the analysis. Given the positive sentiment and Buffett's long-term view, a rise in stock price is more likely than a fall, but the 'expensive' valuation tempers the potential for a significant surge.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple, citing its strong performance, growing customer base, expanding services business, and high profit margins.  While the article mentions the stock's high valuation, it suggests dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate risk.  The positive outlook from a renowned investor like Buffett is generally considered bullish. However, the news itself is not new information; Buffett's long-term holding of Apple is already public knowledge. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be muted, with a slight upward bias due to the reinforcement of positive sentiment. The inclusion of promotional material at the end of the article should be discounted as it is unrelated to the core news about Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a long-term investment favored by Warren Buffett, emphasizing its strong financial performance, growing customer base, and high-profit margins from services. The article also mentions Apple's recent revenue growth, the potential of Apple Intelligence, and its significant net profit. These positive factors are likely to instill confidence in investors, suggesting a bullish sentiment. However, the article also notes that the stock has gotten expensive, which could temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, making a stock price rise more probable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to hold long-term, emphasizing its strong customer base, growing services business, and high margins. Buffett's endorsement and the company's positive financials are likely to boost investor confidence. However, the article also mentions that the stock has gotten expensive over the past year, which might temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive outlook on Apple's growth prospects and Buffett's continued support are likely to have a more significant impact than the potential overvaluation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment approach and features Apple as one of the stocks to hold forever.

Additionally, the article mentions the introduction of Apple Intelligence, which could drive more upgrades and improve growth. Overall, the article presents a positive outlook for Apple's future, suggesting that the stock price is likely to rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, increasing user base, and expanding services. Buffett's endorsement and his belief in holding the stock forever adds significant credibility. Apple's growth in services revenue and expansion into AI indicate strategic moves for future profitability. While the stock is currently expensive, the long-term view supported by high-margin revenues and potential innovations like Apple Intelligence suggest positive outlooks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, emphasizing its strong customer base, growing services revenue, and high profit margins. Buffett's endorsement, along with the company's solid financial performance and potential for future growth through AI integration, suggests a positive outlook. While the stock is noted to be expensive, the overall sentiment remains bullish due to the strong fundamentals and Buffett's long-term investment strategy. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news article reinforces Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, highlighting its strong fundamentals, loyal customer base, and growing services revenue. The potential for future growth through Apple Intelligence is also a positive factor. Previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. Considering this consensus and the positive nature of the news, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise. However, the article also mentions that the stock is expensive, which could temper some enthusiasm, and the market is inherently unpredictable, so I will maintain a non-negligible probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article is largely positive, reiterating Warren Buffett's long-term bullish stance on Apple.  This endorsement from a highly respected investor carries significant weight and is likely to reinforce positive sentiment among investors.  The article highlights Apple's strong fundamentals: growing customer base, expanding services revenue (higher margins), substantial profits, and the potential for AI-driven growth with Apple Intelligence.  However, the article also acknowledges the stock's high valuation, a factor that could temper immediate price increases.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.6 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, and the overall positive sentiment reinforced by Buffett's continued investment, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than the average of previous predictions. The 'Double Down' advertisement is irrelevant to the core news and is disregarded in this analysis.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article strongly emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its robust customer base, growing services revenue, and high profit margins.

Considering these factors, the stock is more likely to rise in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
