Apple's earnings report will be closely watched, especially for updates on AI initiatives, which could positively influence investor sentiment if results are strong. However, any disappointment in earnings or guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision adds macroeconomic uncertainty; a hawkish stance could pressure tech stocks, while a dovish stance might boost them.
