(AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. The article also mentions the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, which can have a broader impact on the market. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's earnings expectations or the potential impact of the interest rate decision on the company. Given the lack of specific information, it is difficult to estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling. However, historically, Apple's stock price has been sensitive to earnings reports and interest rate decisions. Assuming that the earnings report is neutral to positive and the interest rate decision does not have a significant negative impact, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
