(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why RDDT Is Rising for a Second Straight Day\nNews Content: Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit's stock (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers. While this is positive for RDDT, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the mention of AI benefits driving future growth for AAPL, along with Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating, suggests a positive outlook for Apple. Given the overall market sentiment and the focus on AI stocks, there is a higher probability that AAPL's stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, the news has virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price would be due to other factors unrelated to this news.  The mention of Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" rating on AAPL is positive, but this is separate information and doesn't directly relate to the RDDT news.  To assess the probability of AAPL's price movement, we'd need to consider broader market trends, Apple's own financial performance, and other relevant news affecting the company.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content primarily discuss Reddit (RDDT) and its recent performance due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers. However, the news also mentions that Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing AI benefits as a driver for future growth. Since the news does not provide any negative information about Apple and instead highlights a positive outlook from an investment bank, it is reasonable to infer a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the direct relevance of the news to Apple is limited, as the main focus is on Reddit. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise for Apple is modest, while the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for attracting more advertisers due to a technical update, which could lead to increased revenue growth. However, the article also mentions that another investment bank, Evercore ISI, maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing AI benefits driving future growth. The news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc., suggesting a neutral or minimal impact on AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of directly relevant information about AAPL, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but with a slight bias towards stability due to the absence of negative news about AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Reddit's (RDDT) potential to attract more advertisers due to a technical update, which could lead to accelerated revenue growth. However, the article also mentions a bearish outlook from Roth Capital and compares RDDT to other AI stocks. Since the article does not directly discuss Apple Inc. (AAPL), the analysis is not directly applicable to AAPL. Nevertheless, considering the general positive sentiment towards tech and AI stocks, and the fact that Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price movement are estimated based on the overall market sentiment and the fact that AAPL is a major player in the tech industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) recent developments and does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the positive outlook on RDDT might indirectly affect market sentiment towards technology and social media companies. Since the news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct correlation to the company's performance, it's challenging to gauge a direct impact. However, a positive market sentiment could lead to general stock price increases.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers. While this is positive for RDDT, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the mention of Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL and the potential benefits from AI suggest a positive outlook for Apple. Given the overall market sentiment and the focus on AI stocks, there is a higher probability that AAPL's stock price will rise rather than fall, although the direct impact of the news on AAPL is limited.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning slightly positive and others neutral. Considering the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more neutral outlook, acknowledging the positive rating but also the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT), with only tangential relevance to Apple (AAPL).  While Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating for AAPL and cites AI benefits, this is not directly tied to the RDDT news.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  The lack of direct impact from the RDDT news, combined with the generally positive but vague outlook for AAPL, suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Considering the previous predictions and the lack of strong catalysts for significant movement in either direction, a probability slightly favoring a rise is reasonable, but the overall impact is likely minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers.

While Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL) citing AI benefits, this information is only tangentially related to the current news about RDDT. The direct impact of RDDT's news on AAPL is minimal. However, the overall positive sentiment around AI and tech stocks could have a minor beneficial effect on AAPL. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively small direct impact, the probability of AAPL's stock price moving significantly based on this news alone is low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers.
