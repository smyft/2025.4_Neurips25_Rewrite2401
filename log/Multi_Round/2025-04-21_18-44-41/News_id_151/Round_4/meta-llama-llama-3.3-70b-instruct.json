(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a political initiative that could impact corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which are important to many companies, including Apple. While there is resistance from some corporations, the overall sentiment around DEI programs remains strong among major firms. Apple's upcoming vote on DEI policies may create uncertainty, but the company's established commitment to these values suggests that it is likely to maintain its stance. Therefore, the potential for a stock price rise is moderate, while the risk of a fall due to political pressures is also present but less likely given Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance from corporations, including Apple. While some argue these programs are costly, others highlight the economic cost of discrimination. Apple faces a shareholder vote on diversity policies in February, indicating the company's commitment to DEI. The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. While Trump's policies might create some uncertainty, Apple's commitment to DEI aligns with a growing trend among investors and consumers who value social responsibility. This could attract investors and strengthen the company's brand image. However, the potential for political backlash and the uncertainty surrounding the shareholder vote could limit the upside. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back DEI programs, facing resistance from major corporations.  While this could be seen as potentially negative for companies with strong DEI commitments, the article highlights that Apple faces a shareholder vote in February regarding these policies.  The outcome of this vote is uncertain, and the market's reaction will likely depend on the result.  The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, as the DEI issue is one factor among many influencing the company's valuation.  The article doesn't present any direct negative news about Apple's financials or operations. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which has sparked resistance from major corporations, including Apple. While the political stance may create uncertainty, Apple's firm commitment to DEI values, as evidenced by the upcoming shareholder vote, could be seen positively by investors who prioritize corporate social responsibility. However, the broader market reaction may be mixed, as some investors might worry about potential regulatory or reputational risks. Given Apple's strong market position and the relatively indirect impact of this news on its core business, the stock price is more likely to remain stable or rise slightly rather than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and how companies like Apple, Nasdaq, and JPMorgan Chase are responding to these changes. While the article mentions Apple's potential involvement in this issue, it does not provide direct negative or positive impacts specifically on Apple's stock price. However, considering that Apple has a history of supporting DEI initiatives and given that there is no directly negative news about the company's financials or products, the impact on its stock price seems neutral to slightly positive as companies standing firm on DEI values might be viewed favorably by investors who prioritize social responsibility. The overall tone of resistance against rolling back such programs could imply a stable or positive outlook for Apple, as it seems to align with a growing trend of supporting DEI programs among its peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that companies that prioritize DEI may be seen as more socially responsible and attractive to investors. Given that Apple faces a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies, the company's commitment to DEI may be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance, and the outcome of the vote is uncertain, which introduces some risk.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which could create uncertainty for companies like Apple that have strong commitments to these values. However, the resistance from major corporations, including Apple, suggests a firm stance on DEI, which may be viewed positively by socially responsible investors. The upcoming shareholder vote on DEI policies adds an element of uncertainty, but given Apple's established brand and market position, the overall sentiment leans towards a slight probability of stock price increase. The previous predictions indicate a consensus around a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with probabilities clustering around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance from corporations, including Apple. While there are arguments both for and against DEI programs, the overall sentiment from the previous rounds leans towards a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock due to its commitment to DEI. The upcoming shareholder vote introduces some uncertainty, but the prevailing view is that Apple's stance aligns with investor and consumer values. Considering the previous predictions, I will adjust the probabilities slightly to reflect a more nuanced view, acknowledging the potential for both positive and negative reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece discusses President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, encountering resistance from major corporations including Apple.  While this could be viewed negatively by some, Apple's upcoming shareholder vote in February to uphold its DEI policies suggests a strong internal commitment.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, mostly centered around a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  The potential impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term, given the indirect nature of the news and Apple's overall strong financial performance.  The uncertainty surrounding the shareholder vote introduces some risk, but the prevailing sentiment among major corporations to maintain DEI programs suggests a higher likelihood of a positive or neutral market reaction.  Considering the previous predictions and the overall context, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but the impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance from major corporations, including Apple.

The previous predictions show a strong consensus towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, clustering around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall.  The lack of direct negative impact on Apple's core business and its strong market position suggest that any price movement will likely be modest. The overall sentiment leans towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with the potential for a small upward movement driven by investors who value corporate social responsibility.  However, the uncertainty surrounding the shareholder vote and potential political backlash could limit significant upward movement.
