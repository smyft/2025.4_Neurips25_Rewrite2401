Although the specific stocks are not mentioned in the provided text, it is known from general knowledge that Apple Inc.

The endorsement of Apple by Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, can be seen as a positive signal for the company's long-term prospects. This could potentially increase investor confidence in Apple, leading to a rise in its stock price. However, the news does not provide any direct, new information about Apple's current performance, products, or future plans that would directly impact its stock price.
