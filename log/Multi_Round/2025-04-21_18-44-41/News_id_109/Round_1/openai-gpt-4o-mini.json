(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) stock both jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of their Magnificent Seven peers and providing some respite for tech investors amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names following the release of Chinese firm DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"Apple is reacting positively to the DeepSeek news because smaller more efficient models means it will be able to have better AI products in the iPhone.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI investments. The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%.

Apple is set to report earnings after the bell Jan. 30. The majority of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction for Apple due to advancements in AI technology that could enhance its products, particularly the iPhone. Despite a general downturn in tech stocks and downgrades from analysts, the majority still recommend buying Apple, suggesting confidence in its long-term prospects. The recent rise in stock price by over 2% amidst a broader market sell-off indicates resilience. However, the stock is still down 12% from last month, which reflects some underlying concerns. Overall, the positive sentiment from the AI developments and analyst recommendations suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, driven by the potential for more efficient AI models benefiting iPhone AI capabilities, as suggested by the DA Davidson analyst. The DeepSeek news is interpreted positively for Apple. However, the article also mentions that Apple stock is down 12% from last month, facing downgrades due to struggling iPhone sales, and the AI smartphone market hasn't gained traction. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th adds uncertainty. While analysts generally recommend buying the stock with a target price of $246, the recent downgrades and overall market sentiment regarding AI investment suggest caution. Considering these factors, the positive news about AI efficiency is somewhat offset by existing concerns about iPhone sales and market performance. Therefore, the probability of a further rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's stock rose due to the positive implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model (potentially enabling better AI integration in iPhones),  countervailing factors exist.  These include the overall sell-off in AI-related stocks,  recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales, and the upcoming earnings report. The analyst consensus is bullish, with a target price above the current level, but the market's reaction to the DeepSeek news is not necessarily indicative of sustained growth. The positive news is specific to Apple's potential to improve its AI offerings, while the negative factors are broader market trends and company-specific concerns. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderately higher than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the conflicting information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock rose more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of its Magnificent Seven peers, driven by positive sentiment around AI efficiency gains from DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that smaller, more efficient models could enable better AI products in the iPhone, which is a positive for Apple. Additionally, Apple's stock has faced recent downgrades and a 12% drop from last month due to struggling iPhone sales, but the current news provides a temporary boost. However, the broader tech sell-off and concerns over AI infrastructure over-investment could pose risks. Apple's upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 adds uncertainty. Overall, the immediate reaction is positive, but longer-term risks remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock rose more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of its Magnificent Seven peers amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names. The positive reaction is attributed to the release of a cost-effective AI model by DeepSeek, which analysts believe will allow Apple to create better AI products for the iPhone. Despite the recent rise, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and AI smartphone and PC traction. The company is set to report earnings on January 30, with the majority of analysts recommending buying the stock and predicting a rise to $246 over the next 12 months.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's stock price is rising due to the release of DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which could lead to better AI products in the iPhone. Additionally, Meta Platforms' investment in AI and the potential efficiency gains available to future LLMs are also contributing to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month and has been hit with two downgrades last week, which could indicate some uncertainty. Overall, the positive news about AI developments and investments seems to be outweighing the negative factors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has seen a positive reaction from the market, with its stock jumping more than 2% on Monday. This upward movement is attributed to the company reacting positively to news about DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model. Analysts suggest that Apple will benefit from developing better AI products in the iPhone due to such advancements. Despite this positive news, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month, and it faces challenges such as iPhone sales struggles and downgrades from investment firms. However, the overall market sentiment remains positive with a majority of analysts recommending a buy on the stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
