Exxon Mobil and Chevron are scheduled to report quarterly earnings Friday.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock has risen following the announcement of better-than-expected earnings and a solid growth outlook. Positive earnings reports typically lead to increased investor confidence, which often results in a rise in stock prices. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising, while the probability of it falling is significantly lower due to the positive sentiment surrounding the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is moving significantly today. The news content specifies that Apple's stock is rising because the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance. This positive news strongly suggests a higher probability of the stock price continuing to rise. While market sentiment can change, the initial positive reaction to strong earnings and guidance typically sustains for at least a short period. Therefore, the probability of a rise is significantly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content state that Apple stock is rising after reporting better-than-expected earnings and providing positive guidance for future growth.  This is generally considered positive news for the stock. While there's always some market uncertainty, the explicit mention of a stock price rise following positive earnings makes a price increase more likely than a decrease in the short term.  The probabilities are assigned based on this positive news and the typical market reaction to such announcements.  However, it's important to note that these are just probabilities based on the limited information provided and external factors could influence the actual price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is rising due to better-than-expected earnings and guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth forecasts typically lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity, which drives the stock price higher. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth, which typically has a positive impact on stock prices. Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price of Apple is likely to rise. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be high, while the probability of it falling is estimated to be low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and has guided for solid growth. This positive earnings report and guidance typically lead to an increase in stock price as it indicates the company's financial health and future prospects are better than anticipated. Given this information, it is logical to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and is guiding for solid growth, which indicates strong financial performance and positive future outlook. Such news generally leads to an increase in stock prices as it enhances investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which typically leads to increased investor confidence and a rise in stock prices. The consensus among previous predictions is overwhelmingly positive, with probabilities of rising stock prices ranging from 0.75 to 0.85. Given the strong earnings report and positive outlook, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising, while the probability of it falling remains low due to the positive sentiment surrounding the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.88, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.12, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is overwhelmingly positive, with all models predicting a high probability of Apple's stock price rising due to better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance. This positive sentiment is a strong indicator. While market fluctuations are always possible, the consistent positive outlook from multiple models reinforces the likelihood of a continued upward trend. Therefore, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, reflecting the strong agreement among the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.9, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple exceeded earnings expectations and provided positive growth guidance.  This is overwhelmingly positive news and all previous models agree that a price increase is highly probable.  While there's always inherent market risk and unforeseen events, the consensus among the previous models and the strong positive news strongly suggest a high probability of a price rise.  I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the previous models to reflect the consistent positive sentiment and the lack of any countervailing negative information in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which are strong positive signals for the stock. Multiple previous models also predict a high probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.75 to 0.85. Given the consistency in the reasoning across these models\u2014highlighting the positive impact of earnings surprises and growth guidance on investor confidence\u2014it is reasonable to conclude that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall. The consensus among the models suggests a high probability of a price increase, with a lower probability of a decline due to the overwhelmingly positive nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth, leading to a rise in the stock price. Positive earnings reports and growth guidance typically increase investor confidence, resulting in a higher stock price. Considering the consensus among various models, which generally predict a high probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of it falling, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and has guided for solid growth. This positive earnings report and guidance typically lead to an increase in stock price as it indicates the company's financial health and future prospects are better than anticipated. Given this information and considering the trend of others' predictions, which show a high probability of the stock price rising, it is logical to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. The consistency in predictions from various models, all indicating a high likelihood of the stock price rising, further supports this conclusion.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has posted better-than-expected earnings and is guiding for solid growth. This type of news typically leads to an increase in investor confidence, resulting in a higher stock price. Multiple previous predictions from different models also suggest a high probability of the stock price rising. Although external factors could still affect the stock price, the consistent positive sentiment from the news and previous predictions supports a high probability of the stock price increasing.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
