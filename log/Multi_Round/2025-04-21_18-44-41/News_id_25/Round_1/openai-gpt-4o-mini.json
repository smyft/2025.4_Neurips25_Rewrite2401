(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\nNews Content: Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive sales outlook for Apple, which is expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Despite some negative elements, such as a dip in iPhone sales and underperformance in Greater China, the overall sentiment remains optimistic due to the strong performance in the services sector and the potential growth from the new AI features. Given that the company's guidance exceeded expectations and is indicative of demand momentum, there is a greater likelihood of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeds expectations, indicating strong iPhone demand momentum, there are some concerning points. iPhone sales slightly missed estimates, and sales in Greater China were significantly down. However, the positive outlook, driven by Apple Intelligence adoption, appears to be overshadowing the negative aspects in the market's initial reaction (shares rising in premarket trading). Analysts have called the results mixed and are positive about Apple Intelligence's impact on iPhone growth where available. Accounting for both positive and negative aspects, the overall sentiment, driven by the optimistic outlook, leans towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as there is also genuine uncertainty related to China revenue and slower adoption of Apple AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report was mixed. While overall revenue and EPS beat expectations, iPhone sales slightly missed estimates, and sales in Greater China were significantly below projections.  However, the positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, exceeding analyst expectations, and the positive impact of Apple Intelligence (AI features) on iPhone sales are key factors influencing the prediction.  The cautious approach to AI also seems to have shielded Apple from the recent Big Tech downturn. The slightly negative aspects (missed iPhone sales targets, weak China performance) are outweighed by the positive Q2 guidance and the perceived success of Apple Intelligence.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple. While iPhone sales slightly missed estimates, the company's overall revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. The guidance for sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits in the fiscal second quarter surpassed expectations, indicating momentum in iPhone demand. Additionally, the services segment showed strong growth, and Apple's cautious AI strategy has insulated it from recent market volatility. However, challenges remain, such as declining sales in Greater China and slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence features. Overall, the positive aspects of the news, particularly the upbeat sales outlook and strong services performance, are likely to outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's shares are rising due to a rosy sales outlook suggesting iPhone demand momentum. Despite iPhone sales dropping marginally and missing estimates in the holiday shopping quarter, the company's guidance for the fiscal second quarter surpassed expectations, pointing to momentum in iPhone demand. Additionally, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence is boosting sales. The positive outlook and guidance are likely to have a more significant impact on the stock price than the mixed quarterly results.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sales outlook for Apple, with expected sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits in the fiscal second quarter, surpassing expectations. This suggests momentum in demand for the iPhone, which is a significant contributor to Apple's revenue. Although iPhone sales fell marginally in the holiday quarter, the company's services unit showed a 14% year-over-year increase. The mixed results, combined with a more cautious approach to AI and insulation from recent market turmoil, contribute to a generally positive outlook. However, the decline in sales in Greater China is a concern. Considering these factors, the overall tone of the news is moderately positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on Apple's sales, particularly the iPhone sales momentum, which has exceeded expectations despite a slight decline in the holiday quarter. The cautious approach towards AI and its potential benefits have also positively impacted investor sentiment. Moreover, the overall revenue and earnings have beaten the estimates, offsetting the concern over lower iPhone sales in some regions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
