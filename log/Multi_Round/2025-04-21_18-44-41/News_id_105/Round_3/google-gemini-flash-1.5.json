(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's reliance on AI as a growth driver, with analysts expressing skepticism about its potential to elevate the company's valuation. Additionally, Apple's revenue decline in China and weak performance in key segments like Wearables and the iPhone 16 further contribute to a bearish outlook. The competitive landscape, particularly from lower-cost alternatives, adds to the challenges Apple faces. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally negative outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's presence in the AI space, it highlights concerns about its AI strategy not being a significant growth driver yet. The article also points out challenges in the Chinese market, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and unpromising growth prospects for the iPhone 16. The comparison to Chinese AI models being developed at a fraction of the cost further adds to the negative sentiment. The analyst's quote, 'I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet,' is a key indicator of potential investor skepticism. While the article mentions hedge fund interest, it ultimately suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns. Therefore, the negative aspects outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While the headline highlights an analyst's skepticism about AI's immediate impact on Apple's growth, the article also points out several challenges facing the company, including declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and competition for its Vision Pro headset.  The analyst's comment that AI is \"not a story yet\" for Apple suggests a lack of near-term catalysts related to AI.  However, the article also acknowledges the potential of AI for Apple, but suggests other AI stocks might offer better returns in the short term.  The overall tone is cautious, highlighting existing challenges rather than presenting significant positive news.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is considered lower than the probability of a fall, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given Apple's established position and diversified revenue streams. The news is unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights skepticism about Apple's AI capabilities and its potential to drive future growth, with an analyst expressing doubts about AI being a significant catalyst for the company. The article also mentions challenges in key markets like China and weak performance in segments like Wearables, Home, and Accessories. Given these factors, the sentiment around Apple's stock appears negative in the short term, as the market may react to the lack of clear growth drivers and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and an analyst's opinion that AI is not a strong enough driver for Apple to reach the next level. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to the negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's high valuation and lack of promising growth prospects, such as the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro, may lead to a wait-and-see approach from investors. Overall, the analyst's comments and the company's current challenges suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of AI on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and features an analyst's statement that AI is not yet a strong driver for the company. The article highlights Apple's struggles in the Chinese market, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and the challenges faced by its products such as Vision Pro and HomePod. The analyst's skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, combined with the company's existing challenges, suggests a negative outlook for the stock price. However, the article also mentions that Apple ranks 3rd on the list of top AI news, which could indicate some potential for growth. Overall, the negative sentiments and challenges mentioned in the article outweigh the potential for growth, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI's role in driving Apple's future growth. The analyst's comments and current market dynamics, such as declining revenue in China and competition in new product segments, indicate challenges. While Apple has a strong presence and numerous investors, the news emphasizes the lack of compelling new catalysts and current market headwinds.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant skepticism regarding Apple's reliance on AI as a growth driver, with analysts expressing doubts about its potential to elevate the company's valuation. Additionally, the decline in revenue from China and weak performance in key segments like Wearables and the iPhone 16 further contribute to a bearish outlook. The competitive landscape, particularly from lower-cost alternatives, adds to the challenges Apple faces. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment from previous models, coupled with the negative news regarding Apple's AI strategy and market challenges, reinforces a higher probability of the stock price falling. The analyst's skepticism about AI being a growth driver, declining revenue in China, and weak performance in other segments all contribute to this outlook. While Apple remains a strong company, the lack of positive catalysts and increasing competition suggest a downward trend in the short term. The previous rounds all consistently predicted a 0.7 probability of the stock falling, and there is no new information to suggest a change in this trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple's stock in the short term.  While acknowledging Apple's presence in the AI space, the core message centers on an analyst's skepticism regarding AI's ability to significantly boost Apple's growth. This skepticism is reinforced by several factors: declining revenue in China, underperformance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and the lackluster reception of products like the Vision Pro and HomePod.  The comparison to cheaper, more effective Chinese AI models further adds to the negative sentiment.  Although the article mentions a high number of hedge fund investors, the overall tone suggests that other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns.  The consistent predictions from various AI models in previous rounds, all leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, further supports this assessment.  While Apple's established position and diversified revenue streams might mitigate a drastic price drop, the lack of immediate positive catalysts makes a price fall more likely than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with an analyst expressing skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver for the company. Key concerns include declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and competitive pressures from lower-cost alternatives like Meta's Quest and Chinese AI models. The analyst's comment that AI is 'not a story yet' for Apple further dampens sentiment. While Apple remains a strong company with significant hedge fund interest, the lack of near-term catalysts and existing challenges suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a bearish outlook, reinforcing this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The analyst's skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver, combined with the company's existing challenges such as declining revenue in China, weak performance in key segments, and competition from lower-cost alternatives, contributes to a bearish outlook.

Multiple models analyzed previously have indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling.
