Both companies have denied these allegations. While Apple is mentioned in the context of the allegations, it is not directly implicated in any wrongdoing. The article states Apple has not responded to requests for comment. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal because: 1) Apple is not accused of any wrongdoing. 2) The issue is specific to ride-hailing services in India, which is not a core business for Apple. 3) The allegations are being denied by the ride-hailing companies. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect investor sentiment towards Apple. A slight negative impact is possible due to the association with the controversy, but it's unlikely to be substantial.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Ola joins Uber, denies implementing phone model-based pricing in India\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_staying_the_same\": 0.5\n}\n```"
