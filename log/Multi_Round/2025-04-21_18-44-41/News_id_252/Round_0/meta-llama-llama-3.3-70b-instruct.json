This headline does not contain specific positive or negative news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the fact that Apple is a major player in the consumer durables sector could imply that interest in the sector might positively affect the company's stock. Given the lack of specific information about Apple in the headline, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated based on the general interest in the sector and the assumption that Apple, being a significant player, might see a slight positive effect.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
