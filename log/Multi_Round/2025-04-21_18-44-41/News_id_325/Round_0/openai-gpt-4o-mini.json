While this news is primarily about Nvidia, it indirectly impacts Apple as both companies are involved in technology and innovation. If Nvidia struggles, it could affect the competitive landscape in sectors like gaming and AI, where Apple also has interests. However, the news does not directly indicate any negative impact on Apple, and given Apple's strong brand and product ecosystem, the probability of its stock price rising remains higher than falling. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise for Apple, with a lower probability of decline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Nvidia Needs to Appeal to a Bigger Crowd\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
