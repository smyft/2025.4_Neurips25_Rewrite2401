(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that aligns with the trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience and reduce geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan.
