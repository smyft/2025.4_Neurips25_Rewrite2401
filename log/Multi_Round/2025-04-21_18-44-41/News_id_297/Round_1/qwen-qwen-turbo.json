(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that aligns with the trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience and reduce geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. The announcement of mass production starting in Q1 2025 indicates a long-term strategic advantage for Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment and stock price. However, potential delays in production or quality verification could pose risks. Overall, the positive implications of this news outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. While the actual impact is over a year away (Q1 2025), the announcement signals a strengthening of Apple's supply chain and reduces geopolitical risk by diversifying away from Taiwan. The 'Made in America' aspect could also be viewed favorably by investors and consumers. The fact that TSMC is ensuring the quality of the chips matches those from Taiwan mitigates potential concerns about performance. However, the delay in LCY Chemical's deployment and the need to ship chips back to Taiwan for packaging are minor negative points. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price increase. The impact is likely to be moderate, as the event is still far in the future.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news that Apple will begin using chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is generally positive for Apple.  Reducing reliance on Taiwan for chip production mitigates geopolitical and natural disaster risks, enhancing supply chain security. This is a long-term strategic advantage for Apple. However, the news is not a short-term catalyst for a significant price jump. The impact is more about risk reduction and future-proofing than immediate revenue or profit boosts.  The fact that initial production is starting in Q1 2025 means the impact on Apple's financials will be gradual.  While the news is positive, the market may have already priced in some of this expectation, limiting the immediate upward movement. There's also the risk of unforeseen delays or quality issues during the initial production phase, which could negatively impact the stock price. Therefore, a moderate increase in probability is assigned to a price rise, while a small probability is assigned to a price fall, reflecting the overall positive sentiment tempered by the long-term nature of the news and potential risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive development for Apple Inc. as it moves towards semiconductor independence with TSMC's Arizona fab set to launch in Q1 2025. This reduces reliance on Taiwan, mitigating geopolitical and natural disaster risks. The involvement of other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia in test production at the same facility indicates industry confidence in the project. Such strategic moves are likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially boosting Apple's stock price. However, there is a slight risk of delays or logistical challenges, though the overall sentiment is positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple's plan to use chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab, set to launch in Q1 2025, is generally positive for Apple Inc. (AAPL). This development supports Apple's 'Made in America' initiative and could enhance supply chain resilience by reducing reliance on Taiwanese production, which is susceptible to geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. While there might be short-term challenges or costs associated with this transition, the long-term benefits of diversified and localized supply chains are favorable. Therefore, the news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to manufacture chips in Arizona is a positive development for the company, as it reduces reliance on Taiwan and mitigates geopolitical risks. This move is also seen as a step towards semiconductor independence for the United States. The fact that other tech giants, such as AMD and Nvidia, are also testing production in Arizona suggests a potential increase in demand for locally produced chips. Additionally, the completion of the Arizona fab and the upcoming packaging facility in Peoria, Arizona, will likely lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs for Apple. Overall, this news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that TSMC will start supplying semiconductors to Apple from Q1 2025, marking a significant step towards 'Made in America' chips. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience, reduce geopolitical risks, and support U.S. semiconductor independence. It also suggests that the Arizona fab is on track and could attract more tech companies, which is a positive sign for the broader tech sector. These factors are generally seen positively by investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
