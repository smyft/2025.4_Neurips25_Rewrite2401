A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's fiscal Q1 results beating estimates is a strong positive indicator for the company's financial health and investor confidence. This typically leads to an increase in stock price as investors react favorably to better-than-expected earnings. Additionally, the overall market sentiment is positive, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both showing gains. This context further supports the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. However, external factors such as market volatility or negative news from other sectors could still impact the stock negatively, but the strong earnings report outweighs these concerns significantly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates. This is generally positive news for a company, suggesting strong performance and potentially leading to increased investor confidence. The overall market is also up (Nasdaq and S&P 500), providing a tailwind. While the Walgreens news is unrelated to Apple, the positive earnings report is a strong indicator for a potential stock price increase. However, without the specific details of the earnings beat (magnitude, future guidance, etc.), it's difficult to be certain. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the uncertainty with a non-negligible probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates.  This is generally positive news and would be expected to drive up the stock price.  However, the full article is unavailable, so we cannot assess the magnitude of the beat or any other potentially negative factors disclosed in the full report. The overall positive market sentiment (Nasdaq up 1.1%, S&P 500 up 0.6%) also suggests a generally bullish environment, which could further support AAPL's price.  Given the limited information, a conservative estimate is made.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive signal for the company's financial performance. Additionally, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 were up, suggesting a generally positive market sentiment. Beating earnings estimates typically leads to increased investor confidence and a higher likelihood of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's stock price. The overall market sentiment also appears to be positive with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%. This suggests that investors are reacting well to the news, likely leading to an increase in Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive sign for the company. This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, an upward movement in the stock price. Given this information, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better than expected fiscal Q1 results, which is a positive signal for the stock. This beat on estimates typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and potential buying pressure, positively impacting the stock price. However, the overall market sentiment is also upward with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, which could further support AAPL's stock performance. While there is no negative news about Apple in the given content, broader market movements and investor behavior may still influence the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has reported fiscal Q1 results that beat estimates, which is a strong positive signal for the company's financial health and typically leads to increased investor confidence. The overall market sentiment is also positive, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 both showing gains. This context supports a higher likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. While there are always external factors that could impact the stock negatively, the strong earnings report and positive market conditions outweigh these concerns significantly. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is strongly bullish on Apple (AAPL) due to its fiscal Q1 results beating estimates. The positive market sentiment (Nasdaq and S&P 500 up) further reinforces this view. All models have assigned a high probability to the stock price rising, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Given this strong agreement and the nature of the news, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, while still acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in stock market predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's Q1 results beat estimates, a significant positive factor.  The overall market is also positive, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing gains.  This strongly suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase.  While the lack of detail in the earnings beat and the presence of unrelated negative news (Walgreens dividend suspension) introduce some uncertainty, the positive earnings news for Apple itself is the dominant factor.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8.  Considering this consensus and the positive market context, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than the average of previous predictions, acknowledging a small chance of a price fall due to unforeseen circumstances or profit-taking.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a strong positive signal for the company's financial health and investor confidence. Historically, beating earnings estimates tends to lead to an increase in stock price as investors react favorably. Additionally, the overall market sentiment is positive, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 both showing gains, which further supports the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. While there is always some uncertainty due to external factors or undisclosed details in the full report, the consensus from previous predictions (ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for a rise) aligns with the positive news. Given this, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's financial health and investor confidence. Given that the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 were up over 1.1% and 0.6% respectively, it suggests a favorable market environment. Typically, better-than-expected earnings reports lead to increased investor confidence and potential buying pressure, positively impacting the stock price. While external factors and market volatility could still impact the stock, the positive earnings report and overall market sentiment suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a strong positive indicator for the company's financial health and investor confidence. This typically leads to an increase in stock price as investors react favorably to better-than-expected earnings. The overall market sentiment is also positive, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, further supporting the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which show a high probability of the stock price rising, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8, it is reasonable to estimate a similar probability. The consistency in positive predictions across different models suggests a high level of confidence in the stock price rising due to the positive earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has beaten its fiscal Q1 estimates. This is a strong positive indicator and generally leads to increased investor confidence and upward pressure on the stock price. Additionally, the overall market is performing well with gains in both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500, supporting a positive sentiment for AAPL. Previous predictions from various models suggest a high probability of a stock price rise, with most models estimating a probability between 0.7 and 0.8. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is significantly higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
