This suggests a positive sentiment around Apple and its peers, likely leading to increased investor confidence. Additionally, the mention of Apple's influence on major indexes indicates that its performance could impact broader market trends positively.

This positive sentiment, coupled with the group's significant influence on major market indexes, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. However, the article also mentions Tesla sliding, which introduces a slight element of uncertainty. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negative, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple stock surged in 2024 as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group of tech stocks.  This is positive news, indicating strong performance and investor confidence. However, the headline is quite general and doesn't provide specific details about Apple's recent performance or future outlook.  Therefore, while the news is positive, it's not a strong indicator of future price movement.  The probability of a price rise is higher than a fall, but the lack of specific information limits the confidence in this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

This positive performance and the mention of a surge suggest strong investor confidence and momentum in Apple's stock.
