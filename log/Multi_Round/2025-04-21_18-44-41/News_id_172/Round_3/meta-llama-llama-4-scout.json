(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing battle with Apple over app store fees and the introduction of third-party games to its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially increase competition and pressure on Apple's app store revenue, the current legal landscape shows that Apple has largely maintained its position, with a recent court ruling favoring them. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's core business or financials. Therefore, while there is some risk of a negative sentiment due to increased competition, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. Thus, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of stability or slight rise rather than a significant fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, including the Core Technology Fee, could eventually lead to changes that reduce Apple's revenue from the App Store. The fact that no top 100 grossing mobile game developers are willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store due to Apple's fees is a negative signal. However, the legal battles have largely favored Apple so far, and the company has significant market power. The news also highlights Apple's continued dominance in the app ecosystem, despite Epic's efforts. The impact of Epic's actions is likely to be gradual and limited in the short term. Given Apple's strong financial position and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of Epic's challenge, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The market may view this as a continued, but not immediately impactful, challenge to Apple's business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' continued efforts to challenge Apple's App Store dominance. While Epic's actions could potentially pressure Apple in the long term, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The article highlights Epic's struggles to attract major developers to its store, suggesting that the threat to Apple's App Store revenue is not yet significant.  The court case mentioned resulted in a partial victory for Apple, further mitigating the negative impact of this news.  Apple's vast and diverse business model makes it less vulnerable to the impact of a single competitor's actions in the mobile gaming market. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially impact Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, Apple has previously won legal battles against Epic, and the current news does not indicate an immediate threat to Apple's dominant position or revenue streams. The market may view this as a minor development in an ongoing dispute, unlikely to significantly affect Apple's financial performance in the short term. Therefore, the stock price movement is expected to be neutral or slightly negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' efforts to challenge Apple's and Google's dominance in the mobile app store market by adding third-party game titles to its Epic Games Store. This move is part of a longstanding dispute between Epic Games and Apple/Google over app store fees and restrictions. While Epic Games' efforts may pose a threat to Apple's App Store business model, the company's recent legal battles and Apple's efforts to comply with regulations while maintaining control over its ecosystem may limit the immediate impact on Apple's stock price. However, the ongoing competition and potential regulatory changes could affect Apple's business in the long term. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising seems higher than falling, as the company has already adapted to some changes and has a strong financial position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' efforts to challenge Apple's and Google's app store fees by introducing third-party game titles to its mobile marketplace. This development could potentially disrupt Apple's revenue stream from its App Store, as Epic Games' store charges a lower commission rate of 12% compared to Apple's 30%. However, the article also mentions that Apple has made it difficult for Epic Games to gain traction, and none of the top 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers have been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store due to Apple's restrictions. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition for Apple's App Store, which may impact its revenue negatively. However, Apple has shown resilience and has already seen partial success in court. The stock price movement could be influenced by investor sentiment towards Apple's ability to handle such challenges, but it is also important to consider other factors like overall market conditions, product releases, and broader economic trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing challenge to Apple's App Store policies, which could potentially impact Apple's revenue from app store fees. However, the recent legal rulings have largely favored Apple, and the immediate threat from Epic's actions appears limited, as major developers are still hesitant to join the Epic Games Store. While there is some risk of negative sentiment due to increased competition, Apple's strong financial position and market dominance suggest that the overall impact on its stock price will be minimal in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stability or slight rise in Apple's stock price rather than a significant fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued efforts to challenge Apple's App Store policies.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment. Some models predict a higher chance of a rise, while others predict a higher chance of a fall. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Apple has largely maintained its position in the legal battles, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile marketplace with third-party titles represents a continuation of an ongoing conflict with Apple. While this poses a long-term competitive threat to Apple's App Store revenue, the immediate impact is likely to be minimal.  Several factors support this: Apple has largely won previous legal battles against Epic; the article highlights Epic's difficulty in attracting top-tier developers; and Apple's vast business model makes it relatively resilient to this specific challenge.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of a price rise or stability. Considering the limited immediate impact and Apple's overall strong financial position, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the overall effect is likely to be small.  The market's reaction will likely depend more on broader economic factors and Apple's overall performance than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' continued efforts to challenge Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its marketplace, which could pressure Apple's app store revenue.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' efforts to challenge Apple's and Google's dominance in the mobile app store market by adding third-party game titles to its Epic Games Store.

Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of a stock price rise and others a higher probability of a fall, the overall assessment suggests that the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is uncertain and could go either way.

Most predictions from other models suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price due to ongoing legal and market challenges. My analysis considers the strong financial position of Apple and its resilience in past disputes, leading to a moderate likelihood of a stable stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games ramping up its challenge against Apple through the introduction of third-party game titles highlights ongoing competition in the app store market. While this could pose a long-term threat to Apple's revenue from app store fees, recent legal rulings have favored Apple, and major developers remain hesitant to join Epic's platform.

Given the limited immediate impact and Apple's overall strong financial position, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the overall effect is likely to be small. I am slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the previous round, as the market seems to be discounting the impact of Epic's actions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store and challenging Apple's App Store fees is a continuation of an ongoing legal and market battle.
