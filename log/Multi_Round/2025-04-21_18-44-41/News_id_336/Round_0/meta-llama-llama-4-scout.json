(AAPL) is not one of the 5 AI stocks that make up 28.8% of the S&P 500 Index, but it does not provide any direct information about AAPL's stock price movement. However, as AAPL is a major constituent of the S&P 500 Index, its stock price movement may be influenced by the overall market trend and sentiment. The news does not provide any specific information that could be considered directly positive or negative for AAPL. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the neutral impact of this news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 28.8% of the Entire S&P 500 Index\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n\nNote that I've assumed a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising (0.55) compared to falling (0.45), as the news does not provide any specific negative information about AAPL, and the overall market trend may be considered neutral or slightly positive. However, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is relatively neutral, and the probabilities are close to 50/50."
