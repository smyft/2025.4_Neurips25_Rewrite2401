While the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple, it's crucial to determine if Apple is one of those AI stocks. If Apple is one of the mentioned AI stocks, this news is highly positive. Buffett's investment signals strong confidence in the company's future prospects and AI strategy, which typically leads to increased investor interest and a stock price rise. However, if Apple is not one of the mentioned AI stocks, the impact is neutral to slightly negative. Investors might re-evaluate their holdings in Apple compared to the AI stocks Buffett is investing in. Since the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple, we must assume it is not one of the primary AI stocks being referred to. Therefore, the impact is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. Given the lack of direct positive news for Apple, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
