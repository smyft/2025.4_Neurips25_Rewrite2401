(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Could Nvidia Unseat Apple as the Largest Company in the World in 2025?\nNews Content: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are the two largest companies in the world by market capitalization. While Nvidia is valued at roughly $3.38 trillion as of this writing and stands as the second-biggest business, Apple has a valuation of $3.46 trillion and is at the top of the heap.\n\nNotably, both of these tech giants are leaders in different corners of the hardware market. Nvidia is the leading designer of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center computing. Meanwhile, Apple leads the smartphone market with its iPhone lines and captures the majority of global operating profits from mobile phone sales.\n\nAs hardware-focused businesses, Apple and Nvidia's position atop the list of the world's most valuable companies looks even more noteworthy because software-focused businesses usually tend to be more profitable. But while Apple should be able to continue commanding very strong margins on its mobile hardware and other offerings in 2025, the stage could be set for Nvidia to deliver superior stock performance and take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" this year.\n\nNvidia's outlook for 2025 appears stronger than Apple's\n\nNvidia stock has been on an incredible run as rising demand for AI technologies has spurred massive sales and earnings growth for the company. The AI leader's share price rocketed 131.5% higher over the last year, and there were brief periods in 2024 when it had a higher market cap than Apple and stood as the world's largest company. While Nvidia's business has historically been shaped by cyclical demand trends in the semiconductor industry and will face tougher growth comparisons in 2025, its outlook still appears stronger than Apple's.\n\nApple is facing some performance headwinds in China -- its second-largest geographic segment by revenue. The mobile hardware giant hasn't been able to find a suitable Chinese partner to incorporate its Apple Intelligence platform into its latest iPhones. Due to regulations put in place by China's government, many products and services need to have a domestic operational partner in order to be sold in the country. As a result, the iPhone 16s in China do not have the Apple Intelligence platform and are facing a tougher competitive environment because of it.\n\nApple is also facing some regulatory pressures in the domestic market. In March of last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against the company alleging that it has created an illegal monopoly on the smartphone market by tying developers into its ecosystem through contractual restrictions. While it's possible that the DOJ under the new Trump administration will take a comparatively hands-off approach to antitrust matters and other issues compared to operations under the Biden administration, it's not clear the iPhone maker will benefit from this dynamic.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMargins and sales trends support Nvidia taking the crown\n\nOver the trailing-12-month period, Apple posted a gross profit of $180.7 billion on sales of $391 billion -- good for a gross margin of 46.2%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has posted a gross profit of $85.9 billion on sales of $113.3 billion across the same stretch -- representing a gross margin of 75.8%. So while Apple has generated far more overall sales and gross profit over the past year, Nvidia's gross profit margin is far higher. This distinction becomes even more significant when looking at recent sales momentum for both businesses.\n\nNvidia's revenue increased 94% year over year to reach $35.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Earnings per share for the period surged 111% annually to reach $0.78.\n\nFor comparison, Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year to $94.9 billion -- and its diluted earnings per share rose 12% to hit $1.64. Market data from Counterpoint Research suggests that Apple's iPhone unit shipments fell 5% year over year in the final quarter of 2024, so sales growth will be harder to deliver with its next financial report.\n\nIn order to return to stronger sales and earnings growth, Apple may need to deliver a new product or a software service offering with a more groundbreaking impact. The company's iPhone lines reliably serve up strong sales and great margins, but the smartphone market is saturated -- and growth has become harder to deliver.\n\nIn contrast, the demand outlook for Nvidia's GPUs continues to be very strong in 2025 amid ongoing AI infrastructure spending, and the rollout of the company's new Blackwell processors should support strong sales expansion and margins. With that in mind, I think there's a very good chance that Nvidia will take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" back from Apple and hold on to it for most of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple, including performance headwinds in China and regulatory pressures, which could negatively impact its stock price. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing strong growth driven by demand for AI technologies, suggesting a more favorable outlook for its stock. Given these factors, there is a higher probability that Apple's stock price will fall compared to the likelihood of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization lead, it highlights several headwinds: slowing growth in the saturated smartphone market, regulatory pressures in the US, and challenges in China due to the lack of a local partner for Apple Intelligence. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by strong demand for AI GPUs and boasts significantly higher gross profit margins. The article suggests Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's stock advisor team doesn't consider Nvidia as one of the best stocks to buy now. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI demand and superior margins compared to Apple.  Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US, coupled with slower iPhone sales growth. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, Nvidia's current trajectory suggests a higher potential for market capitalization growth.  The article's conclusion leans heavily towards Nvidia surpassing Apple's market cap, but this is based on current trends and doesn't account for unforeseen market shifts or competitive disruptions.  Therefore, while the probability of Nvidia's rise is higher, the probability of Apple's fall is not necessarily high, as it remains a dominant player.  The news is more likely to impact Nvidia positively and Apple negatively, but the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be less dramatic than the potential impact on Nvidia's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a competitive dynamic between Apple and Nvidia, with Nvidia showing stronger growth metrics and a more favorable outlook due to booming AI demand, while Apple faces challenges in China and regulatory pressures. Nvidia's higher gross margins and recent sales momentum suggest it may outperform Apple in the near term. However, Apple's established market position and brand strength provide some resilience. Given the mixed signals, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the highlighted headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Nvidia could potentially unseat Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalization in 2025. Nvidia's strong outlook for 2025, driven by rising demand for AI technologies and its leadership in the GPU market, is contrasted with Apple's performance headwinds in China and regulatory pressures. Additionally, Nvidia's gross profit margin is significantly higher than Apple's, and its recent sales momentum is much stronger. This comparison implies a more favorable outlook for Nvidia's stock performance relative to Apple's in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the possibility of Nvidia surpassing Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalization in 2025.

The article also notes Nvidia's superior gross profit margin and recent sales momentum. Based on this analysis, it appears that Nvidia has a higher likelihood of outperforming Apple in the near term, which could lead to a rise in its stock price. However, the article does not provide a strong bearish case for Apple, suggesting that the probability of its stock price falling is lower.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Nvidia's superior growth projections and higher margins compared to Apple.
