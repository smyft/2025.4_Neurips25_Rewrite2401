(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments compared to previous years. This decline in performance, especially in a key market like China, could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in stock price. The competition from Huawei and vivo, which are gaining ground, further exacerbates the situation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone shipments in Mainland China, both for the full year 2024 and in Q4. While the overall market is growing, Apple is losing market share to domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo. This suggests weakening demand for Apple products in a crucial market. The increased competition and Apple's declining shipments are negative indicators. While the overall market is projected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to capitalize on that growth is uncertain given the current trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's significant drop in market share in the crucial Chinese smartphone market is the primary concern.  While the overall Chinese market showed growth, Apple's 17% decline year-over-year and a 25% drop in Q4 sales are substantial. This suggests weakening demand for Apple products in China, a major market.  The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, fueled by government subsidies and aggressive marketing, directly impacts Apple's sales. Although the overall market is expected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to regain lost ground remains uncertain.  The news is negative for Apple's short-term prospects in China, but the impact on the overall stock price will depend on how investors weigh this against Apple's performance in other markets and its overall financial health.  A significant drop is less likely than a moderate dip, given Apple's global presence and other product lines. However, the negative news regarding a key market is likely to cause some downward pressure.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are gaining market share. Given that China is a significant market for Apple, this loss of market share could negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's revenue projections. The overall smartphone market in China is growing, but Apple is not benefiting from this growth as much as its competitors. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, a 17% drop from 2023, placing them third in the market. Specifically, in Q4, Apple's sales dropped 25% from the same period in 2023, with Huawei and vivo tying for second place. This negative performance compared to competitors is likely to be viewed unfavorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. However, the overall smartphone market in China is growing, and Apple still maintains a significant presence. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising due to this specific news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone market share in mainland China, where it has lost ground to competitors like Huawei and vivo. Despite Apple maintaining the top spot with 13.1 million devices sold, its sales decreased by 25% year-over-year, which is a concerning trend. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in stock price due to reduced market share and declining sales.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
