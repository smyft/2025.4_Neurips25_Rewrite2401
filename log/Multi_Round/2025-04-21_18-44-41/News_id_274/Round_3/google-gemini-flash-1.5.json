(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments compared to previous years. This decline in performance, especially in a key market like China, could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in stock price. The competition from Huawei and vivo, which are gaining ground, further exacerbates the situation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone shipments in Mainland China, both for the full year 2024 and in Q4. While the overall market is growing, Apple is losing market share to domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo. This suggests weakening demand for Apple products in a crucial market. The increased competition and Apple's declining shipments are negative indicators. While the overall market is projected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to capitalize on that growth is uncertain given the current trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's significant drop in market share in the crucial Chinese smartphone market is the primary concern.  While the overall Chinese market showed growth, Apple's 17% decline year-over-year and a 25% drop in Q4 sales are substantial. This suggests weakening demand for Apple products in China, a major market.  The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, fueled by government subsidies and aggressive marketing, directly impacts Apple's sales. Although the overall market is expected to grow in 2025, Apple's ability to regain lost ground remains uncertain.  The news is negative for Apple's short-term prospects in China, but the impact on the overall stock price will depend on how investors weigh this against Apple's performance in other markets and its overall financial health.  A significant drop is less likely than a moderate dip, given Apple's global presence and other product lines. However, the negative news regarding a key market is likely to cause some downward pressure.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are gaining market share. Given that China is a significant market for Apple, this loss of market share could negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's revenue projections. The overall smartphone market in China is growing, but Apple is not benefiting from this growth as much as its competitors. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is losing ground in mainland China's smartphone market to competitors like Huawei and vivo. According to the article, Apple shipped 42.9 million units, a 17% drop from 2023, placing them third in the market. Specifically, in Q4, Apple's sales dropped 25% from the same period in 2023, with Huawei and vivo tying for second place. This negative performance compared to competitors is likely to be viewed unfavorably by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments compared to 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. However, the overall smartphone market in China is growing, and Apple still maintains a significant presence. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising due to this specific news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone market share in mainland China, where it has lost ground to competitors like Huawei and vivo. Despite Apple maintaining the top spot with 13.1 million devices sold, its sales decreased by 25% year-over-year, which is a concerning trend. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in stock price due to reduced market share and declining sales.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost significant market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% decline in shipments for 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4 compared to the previous year. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are gaining market share due to government subsidies and aggressive marketing strategies. While the overall smartphone market in China is expected to grow, Apple's inability to capitalize on this growth raises concerns about its future performance in a key market. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, as investor sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted by this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds, coupled with the concrete data showing Apple's significant decline in the Chinese market, reinforces the likelihood of a stock price decrease. While the overall market is growing, Apple is clearly losing ground to competitors. The magnitude of the decline (17% annually, 25% in Q4) is substantial and likely to worry investors. The rise of Huawei and vivo, fueled by government support, presents a strong competitive challenge. The consensus from previous rounds heavily favors a price decrease, and there's no new information to suggest a reversal of this trend. Therefore, I will stick with the consensus and even slightly increase the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in the crucial Chinese smartphone market.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is growing, Apple's substantial year-over-year drops (17% for the full year and 25% in Q4) in shipments are alarming.  The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, aided by government subsidies, directly challenges Apple's position.  Although Apple remains a global giant with diverse revenue streams, this negative trend in a major market is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term.  The previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, and the data presented supports this view.  While a complete collapse is unlikely given Apple's overall strength, a moderate dip is more probable than a rise based on this news alone. The projected growth in the Chinese market in 2025 offers some long-term hope, but the immediate impact of the reported decline is likely to be negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company. Apple's shipments dropped by 17% in 2024 and 25% in Q4 compared to the previous year, while competitors like Huawei and vivo saw substantial growth. This loss of market share in a key region is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's revenue projections. Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's inability to capitalize on this growth due to increased competition suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus from previous predictions also supports this view, with most models assigning a higher probability to a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments in 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This decline is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which are gaining market share. Given that China is a significant market for Apple, this loss of market share could negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's revenue projections. The overall smartphone market in China is growing, but Apple is not benefiting from this growth as much as its competitors. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling in response to this news. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, the estimated probabilities reflect a negative short-term outlook for AAPL stock price due to this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a significant drop in shipments compared to previous years.

The competition from Huawei and vivo, which are gaining ground, further exacerbates the situation. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, it is likely that the market will react negatively to this news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued decline in Apple's smartphone market share in Mainland China, a significant market for the company, with a 17% drop in shipments for the full year 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4. This trend is driven by increasing competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, supported by government subsidies and aggressive marketing. Although the overall Chinese smartphone market is growing, Apple is not capturing this growth effectively. The repeated predictions from various models suggest a strong consensus that Apple's declining market share and sales in China will negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments for 2024 and a 25% drop in Q4 compared to the previous year.

Apple's significant decline in market share (17% annually, 25% in Q4) and the rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, supported by government initiatives, are concerning factors. While the overall market is projected to grow, Apple's ability to capitalize on this growth is questionable given the current trends. The previous predictions consistently favor a price decrease, and there's no new information to suggest a reversal of this trend. Therefore, I maintain a high probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a clear picture of Apple losing significant market share in the crucial Chinese smartphone market.  The 17% year-over-year decline in shipments and the 25% drop in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023 are substantial and cannot be ignored.

While the overall Chinese smartphone market is growing, Apple's failure to capitalize on this growth is a major concern.  The consensus among previous predictions consistently points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.  Although Apple's diverse product portfolio and global presence mitigate the risk of a catastrophic drop, the negative impact on investor sentiment from this significant loss of market share in a key region is likely to outweigh any positive factors in the short term.  The projected growth in the Chinese market for 2025 offers some long-term hope, but the immediate impact of the reported decline is overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company.
