A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is impacting stock futures negatively. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The negative aspects include: 1) US stock futures are falling due to the tech sector's tumble, potentially impacting AAPL. 2) DeepSeek AI from China is causing concerns, suggesting increased competition and potentially negative sentiment towards tech stocks. The positive aspects include: 1) Apple is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, which often receive significant investor attention. 2) Apple is reporting earnings this week, which could be a catalyst for a price increase if the results are positive. 3) Pfizer gains after activist investor forgoes board nominations, which could indicate a positive trend in the market. Considering these factors, the negative news regarding DeepSeek AI and the overall tech sector downturn likely outweigh the potential positive impact of earnings. The Fed meeting adds uncertainty, but the initial reaction seems negative. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market is negative due to the new Chinese AI model and the upcoming Fed meeting, which could lead to increased interest rates. This negative market sentiment is likely to impact Apple, even though it's not directly mentioned in the negative news. However, Apple is reporting earnings this week, which is a significant event that could outweigh the general market negativity if the results are strong.  The probability of a price rise is therefore contingent on the strength of Apple's earnings report. Given the current market uncertainty, a fall is considered slightly more likely than a rise in the short term, immediately following the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which is causing US stock futures to fall. Additionally, Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven group set to report earnings this week, which could introduce volatility. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds further uncertainty, potentially impacting tech stocks negatively if interest rate decisions are unfavorable. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative impact on the tech sector due to the emergence of DeepSeek AI and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the tech companies set to report earnings this week, which could add volatility to its stock price. Given the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the Fed meeting, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector is tumbling due to the newest artificial intelligence model developed by China's DeepSeek, which could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, which can be a significant factor in stock price movement. However, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and its impact on fiscal policy for 2025 could also influence the stock market. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment seems bearish for the tech sector, including Apple, due to the AI concerns and potential interest rate changes. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of upcoming tech earnings and broader market movements influenced by concerns over a new AI model from China's DeepSeek. The negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to AI-related concerns could potentially put downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and recent performance might mitigate some of these pressures.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over the new AI model from China's DeepSeek, which is impacting stock futures negatively. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, the overall sentiment appears bearish for Apple, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a negative outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to concerns about DeepSeek AI impacting the tech sector, uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, and the general market volatility. While Apple's earnings report could be a positive catalyst, the prevailing sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a price decline. Considering the consistent bearish predictions and the lack of new positive information, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a stronger negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The negative factors are significant: a general downturn in the tech sector driven by concerns over DeepSeek AI, and the upcoming Fed meeting which could result in increased interest rates. These factors suggest a bearish market sentiment that is likely to impact Apple, even before considering its own earnings report.  However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a major potential catalyst.  Strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative market sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a price fall, but with a significant minority predicting a rise.  Considering the weight of the negative market factors and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant potential for a price rise if the earnings are strong.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which is causing US stock futures to fall. Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven group set to report earnings this week, which could introduce volatility. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds further uncertainty, potentially impacting tech stocks negatively if interest rate decisions are unfavorable. While Apple's strong fundamentals might provide some support, the overall market sentiment and sector-specific concerns suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a fall, with most models estimating a 60-70% chance of a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is impacting stock futures negatively. Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven group set to report earnings this week, which could introduce volatility. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds further uncertainty, potentially impacting tech stocks negatively if interest rate decisions are unfavorable. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term. However, the earnings report could be a significant catalyst for movement, potentially mitigating some of the negative sentiment if the results are strong.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which is causing US stock futures to fall. Additionally, Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven group set to report earnings this week, which could introduce volatility. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds further uncertainty, potentially impacting tech stocks negatively if interest rate decisions are unfavorable. Considering the overall negative market sentiment, the emergence of a new AI model, and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the Fed meeting, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising. However, the fact that Apple is a strong company with a history of resilience and the potential for positive earnings reports suggests that the probability of a price rise is not negligible. The predictions from other models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of around 0.65. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.35 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.65.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting the tech sector, including the development of a new AI model by DeepSeek, which has caused US stock futures to fall. Apple, as part of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, is particularly vulnerable to this negative sentiment. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports for several tech giants, including Apple, create uncertainty. Lastly, the Federal Reserve's policy meeting adds further volatility to the market, especially with the potential for interest rate adjustments. While Apple's strong fundamentals and earnings could provide a temporary boost, the overall negative sentiment and market conditions suggest a higher likelihood of stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from China's DeepSeek, which is impacting stock futures negatively. Additionally, the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, add uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence market conditions, particularly if interest rates are adjusted. Given these factors, the overall sentiment appears bearish for Apple, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term. While there is potential for a positive reaction to Apple's earnings report, the prevailing negative sentiment in the tech sector and uncertainty surrounding the Fed meeting suggest a greater likelihood of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from previous rounds is bearish, primarily due to concerns surrounding DeepSeek AI, the upcoming Fed meeting, and general tech sector volatility. While Apple's earnings report remains a potential positive catalyst, the consistent negative predictions and the lack of significant new positive information suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline. The slight increase in some models' probability of a price rise in Round 1 seems to acknowledge the earnings report's potential, but the overall negative pressure remains strong. Therefore, I will maintain a higher probability for a price fall, but slightly adjust it to reflect the potential for a positive earnings surprise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Negative factors include a general downturn in the tech sector due to DeepSeek AI, and the upcoming Fed meeting which could increase interest rates.  These factors suggest a bearish market sentiment likely to impact Apple even before its earnings report. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a major potential catalyst. Strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative market sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a price fall, but with a significant minority predicting a rise.  Considering the weight of the negative market factors and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, and the consistent bearish trend in previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant potential for a price rise if the earnings are strong.  The consensus leans towards a fall, but the possibility of a positive surprise from earnings keeps the probability of a rise from being extremely low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from China's DeepSeek, which is impacting stock futures negatively.

However, Apple's strong fundamentals and the potential for positive earnings reports suggest that the probability of a price rise is not negligible. Based on the analysis and the consensus from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.3 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.7.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over a new AI model from DeepSeek, which is impacting stock futures negatively.
