Tim Cook's statement is generic and expresses a positive view on innovation driving efficiency, but doesn't indicate any specific partnership, investment, or competitive threat related to DeepSeek.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price rise or fall is largely attributed to other market factors and not this specific news item.
