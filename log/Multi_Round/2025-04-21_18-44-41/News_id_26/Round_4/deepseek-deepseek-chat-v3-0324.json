(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple, with positive earnings guidance boosting investor sentiment, while external factors like Trump's tariff threats create uncertainty. The strong earnings outlook suggests a likelihood of stock price increase, but ongoing tariff concerns could dampen enthusiasm. Given the recent trends in stock futures and Apple's response to recent market turmoil, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Futures are up, indicating positive market sentiment. Apple's earnings guidance exceeded expectations, which is a strong positive signal, further boosted by CEO's comments on Apple Intelligence. However, Trump's tariff threats cast a shadow of uncertainty over the entire market and could negatively impact Apple. Additionally, a potentially higher PCE could lead to uncertainty over the Fed's actions. Weighing the positive earnings guidance against the external economic uncertainties and potential down-side from tariffs necessitates considering a mixed probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall market futures are positive, Trump's tariff threats introduce significant uncertainty.  Apple's earnings report, however, is generally positive, exceeding expectations and suggesting continued iPhone demand.  The improved outlook for Apple's second quarter and its relatively cautious approach to AI, which insulated them during recent market turbulence, are positive factors.  The upcoming inflation report might affect the overall market and thus indirectly impact Apple, but the immediate impact of the earnings report seems more significant. Weighing these factors, the positive news from Apple's earnings announcement likely outweighs the general market uncertainty caused by Trump's threats, suggesting a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors influencing Apple Inc.'s stock price. On the positive side, Apple's earnings report showed a rebound in extended hours trading, with executives providing a rosier outlook for sales growth in the fiscal second quarter, surpassing expectations. This is likely to boost investor confidence. Additionally, Apple's cautious approach to AI has insulated it from market turmoil affecting other Big Tech stocks. On the negative side, broader market concerns include Trump's tariff threats, which could lead to inflationary pressures and trade wars, creating uncertainty. However, the immediate impact of Apple's positive earnings and outlook seems to outweigh these broader concerns. The upcoming PCE data could also influence the market, but its direct impact on Apple is less clear.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses several factors that could impact Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple's iPhone outlook for the fiscal second quarter was better than expected, with executives predicting sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits. This guidance surpassed expectations and indicated momentum in demand for the iPhone. Additionally, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence features are boosting sales. On the negative side, the article mentions renewed tariff threats from President Trump, which could lead to increased uncertainty and potentially impact Apple's supply chain and profitability. However, the overall market sentiment seems to be cautiously optimistic, with US stock futures inching higher. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising as 0.6 and the probability of it falling as 0.4.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses various market-moving factors, including Trump's tariff threats, Apple's earnings, and the upcoming release of the personal consumption expenditures price index. Apple's earnings surpassed expectations, with the company expecting sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. This positive outlook, combined with the overall market trend of futures pointing higher, suggests a favorable environment for Apple's stock price. However, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff threats and potential inflationary pressures could introduce volatility. Given the positive earnings report and the market's initial reaction, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for the tech sector as a whole, with Apple's specific guidance surpassing expectations for the next quarter and the stock reacting positively. While market concerns over potential tariffs from Trump could cause some volatility, the core message around Apple's iPhone business shows positive trends. The PCE data is expected to show inflation rising but remains within a predicted range, and oil prices are stable but trending downwards. These factors combined suggest a bullish outlook for Apple based on their earning results.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple Inc. despite external uncertainties like Trump's tariff threats. The company's earnings guidance for the fiscal second quarter exceeded expectations and indicated growth, which should boost investor confidence. Although tariff threats could introduce volatility and potential inflationary pressures, the immediate positive reaction in Apple's stock and strong earnings results suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Considering market trends and previous predictions by various models, I estimate the probabilities, aligning them with the overall bullish sentiment and cautiousness in the broader market context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.66, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.34, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors: positive earnings guidance from Apple which is a strong bullish signal, concerns surrounding Trump's tariff threats that introduce market uncertainty, and the possibility of increased inflation indicated by the PCE data. The previous rounds of models showed a relatively stable estimate of approximately 0.6-0.7 of the stock price rising and 0.3-0.4 of stock price falling, and there's a slight pull towards 0.65 due to the mean of the models. The prevailing futures indicated generally positive sentiment. In considering these factors, this estimate will slightly be conservative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include exceeding earnings expectations and a positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, indicating strong iPhone demand and the success of Apple Intelligence.  The overall market sentiment is also cautiously optimistic, with futures trading higher. However, significant uncertainty remains due to Trump's renewed tariff threats, which could increase inflationary pressures and negatively impact the broader market, potentially affecting Apple indirectly. The upcoming PCE inflation report adds further uncertainty. While Apple's positive earnings news is a strong factor suggesting a price rise, the considerable external uncertainties temper this optimism. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly cluster around a 60-70% chance of a price rise and the relatively limited information about the impact of the external factors, I lean towards a slightly more cautious assessment than the previous models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's earnings report exceeded expectations, with executives forecasting sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the fiscal second quarter. This positive guidance, along with CEO Tim Cook's comments on Apple Intelligence boosting sales, has already led to a rebound in extended hours trading. The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turbulence affecting other Big Tech stocks. Additionally, U.S. stock futures are pointing higher, indicating overall positive market sentiment. However, potential risks include Trump's fresh tariff threats, which could introduce uncertainty and inflationary pressures, and the upcoming PCE data, which might affect broader market sentiment. Despite these risks, the immediate positive impact of Apple's earnings and outlook appears to outweigh the potential negatives. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with most estimates around 0.6 to 0.7. Considering all these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.64, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.36, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's earnings guidance for the fiscal second quarter surpassed expectations, with executives predicting sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits. This positive outlook, combined with the overall market trend of futures pointing higher, suggests a favorable environment for Apple's stock price. Additionally, Apple's cautious approach to AI has insulated it from market turmoil affecting other Big Tech stocks. However, there are negative factors such as Trump's renewed tariff threats, which could lead to inflationary pressures and trade wars, creating uncertainty. The upcoming PCE data could also influence the market, but its direct impact on Apple is less clear. Considering these factors, the positive earnings report and market reaction suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with positive earnings guidance and a rosier outlook for the fiscal second quarter, but also uncertainty from Trump's tariff threats and potential inflationary pressures. However, the overall market sentiment seems cautiously optimistic, with US stock futures inching higher. Considering the positive earnings report, the company's cautious approach to AI, and the market's initial reaction, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.62 and the probability of it falling as 0.38.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.66, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.34, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with positive indicators from the company's earnings guidance, which exceeded expectations and pointed towards growth for the upcoming quarter. The market sentiment is generally optimistic, as indicated by rising U.S. stock futures. However, there are significant external uncertainties due to President Trump's tariff threats, which could negatively impact market conditions and investor confidence, introducing volatility. Despite these uncertainties, the immediate positive reaction to Apple's earnings is likely to outweigh the potential negative impacts of the tariffs in the short term. This analysis leads to a probability assessment leaning towards a stock price rise, albeit with caution regarding external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The overall sentiment appears slightly positive for Apple. The earnings beat and positive guidance for the next quarter are strong indicators that the stock price may rise. The potential negative impacts from Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming PCE data are real but likely less impactful in the short term compared to the company-specific positive news. The previous models have mostly converged around a probability of 0.6 to 0.7 for the stock price rising. Considering the factors and the consensus of previous predictions, I will slightly adjust towards incorporating potential downside risk factors. I will be slightly conservative due to the uncertainty and potential negative impacts of the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, leading to a positive market reaction and a rosier outlook for Q2.  This is a strong bullish signal. However, President Trump's renewed tariff threats introduce significant uncertainty and potential inflationary pressures, which could negatively impact the broader market and consequently Apple's stock price. The upcoming PCE data adds to this uncertainty.  The previous predictions from various models show a consistent range, with a slight upward trend towards a higher probability of a price rise. Considering the positive earnings news as the primary driver, but acknowledging the considerable external headwinds, I am adjusting my prediction slightly downwards from the previous rounds' consensus, reflecting the inherent risk associated with the tariff threats and broader economic uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's earnings report exceeded expectations, with executives forecasting sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the fiscal second quarter.

Considering all these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise, with most estimates around 0.6 to 0.7. Considering all these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.64, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.36, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with positive earnings guidance and a rosier outlook for the fiscal second quarter, but also uncertainty from Trump's tariff threats and potential inflationary pressures. However, the overall market sentiment seems cautiously optimistic, with US stock futures inching higher. Considering the positive earnings report, the company's cautious approach to AI, and the market's initial reaction, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.64 and the probability of it falling as 0.36. This estimation is also influenced by the previous predictions from other models, which mostly lean towards a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but overall slightly positive outlook for Apple Inc., given that the company's earnings have exceeded expectations with guidance for the fiscal second quarter projecting growth. This is expected to bolster investor confidence. Trump's renewed tariff threats and potential inflationary pressures from the PCE data add uncertainty, but the immediate impact of the earnings report seems more influential. The current trends suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise, supported by the bullish guidance and the strong market futures, while the negative sentiments remain relatively tempered.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. The positive earnings guidance and expected sales growth exceed analysts' expectations, which likely boosts investor confidence and market sentiment. However, external factors, including Trump's tariff threats, introduce uncertainties that could impact the broader market and Apple\u2019s stock price negatively. Despite these uncertainties, the immediate positive reaction to the earnings announcement suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rise in the short term. Therefore, my estimates reflect a bullish sentiment based on the earnings results, adjusted for the caution surrounding external economic factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: Apple's exceeding earnings expectations and providing positive guidance for the next quarter are strong bullish signals, contributing to a higher probability of stock price increase. The overall market sentiment is also optimistic with futures pointing higher. However, Trump's tariff threats introduce economic uncertainty and potential inflationary pressures, which act as headwinds. The PCE data release adds another element of uncertainty. Considering previous predictions have consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and balancing the positive earnings news with the negative external factors, I slightly temper the extent of bullish inclination.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, and the Q2 outlook is positive, suggesting strong iPhone demand and success with Apple Intelligence.  This is a significant bullish signal, likely driving the initial positive market reaction and higher stock futures. However, significant uncertainty remains due to Trump's renewed tariff threats, which could negatively impact the broader market and introduce inflationary pressures. The upcoming PCE data adds further uncertainty.  The consensus among previous model predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price rise (around 60-70%), but I am adjusting slightly downwards to reflect the considerable external headwinds. The positive earnings news is the primary driver, but the tariff threats and broader economic uncertainty introduce significant risk, making a purely bullish prediction less certain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple Inc.
