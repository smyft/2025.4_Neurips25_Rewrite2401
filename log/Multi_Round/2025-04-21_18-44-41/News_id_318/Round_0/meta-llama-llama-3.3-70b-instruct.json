However, as a major player in the tech industry, any significant changes in the regulatory landscape or the removal of a major competitor in the app store could potentially impact Apple's market position. Since TikTok is a competitor to some of Apple's services, a ban could be seen as beneficial to Apple. Nevertheless, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect. Given this, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are relatively low due to the indirect nature of the news.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
