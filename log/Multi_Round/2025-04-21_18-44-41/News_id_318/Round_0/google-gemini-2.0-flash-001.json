While TikTok's potential removal from the App Store could slightly increase usage of alternative video platforms available on iOS, the overall effect on Apple's revenue and user base is expected to be minimal. Apple's revenue streams are highly diversified, and its success isn't heavily reliant on any single app. The uncertainty surrounding the Supreme Court's decision might create some minor volatility, but the core business of Apple remains unaffected. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement, either up or down, directly attributable to this news is relatively low. The market's reaction will likely be muted, with other factors having a more substantial influence on Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```"
