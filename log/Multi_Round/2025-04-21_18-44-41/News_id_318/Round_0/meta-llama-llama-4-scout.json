However, as a major tech company, Apple's stock price can be indirectly affected by broader market sentiment and regulatory trends. The news about TikTok, a competitor in the social media space, might have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price if investors perceive TikTok's potential issues as beneficial for Apple's ecosystem dominance, given that TikTok's troubles could reduce competition for Apple's own services. But this connection is tenuous and not directly impactful on Apple's core business. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news about TikTok is relatively low. The news is more about regulatory challenges faced by another company rather than a direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
