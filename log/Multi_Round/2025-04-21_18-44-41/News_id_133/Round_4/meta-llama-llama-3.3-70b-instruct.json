(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones\nNews Content: BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom companies regarding Apple's market power and the potential negative impact of eSims on their business models. While this could create regulatory scrutiny for Apple, the company has a strong market position and has not been directly implicated in any wrongdoing. Additionally, Apple's response emphasizes its commitment to competition and innovation. The overall sentiment may lead to short-term volatility, but the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong due to its established brand and customer loyalty. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential to leverage eSIM technology to gain more control over the mobile market and potentially disintermediate network operators. This could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential limitations on Apple's business practices. While the article mentions Apple's response emphasizing competition and innovation, the core issue is a potential threat to Apple's future revenue streams and market dominance. The CMA investigation, though not directly related to eSIMs, indicates a growing regulatory interest in Apple's market power. The negative sentiment from telecom operators and the potential for regulatory action suggest a higher probability of a stock price decrease than increase. However, Apple is a large and diversified company, and this issue is unlikely to have a catastrophic impact. Therefore, the probability of a fall is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: BT's concerns regarding Apple's potential to leverage eSims to gain more control over the mobile market and potentially disintermediate telecom operators are noteworthy.  However, the news doesn't present a direct, immediate threat to Apple's core business or profitability.  The CMA investigation is ongoing, and the potential for regulatory action is uncertain. While the concerns raised could lead to future regulatory hurdles for Apple, the current news is unlikely to cause a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The article highlights that Apple already faces competition and that this is not a new concern for the company.  Apple's statement emphasizes its commitment to competition and user trust.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price drop is relatively low, and the probability of a rise or remaining stable is higher, given Apple's overall strong market position and continued innovation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators about Apple's potential to leverage its market power through eSim technology, which could disrupt traditional telecom services. While this raises regulatory and competitive risks for Apple, the immediate impact on its stock price is likely limited. Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diversified revenue streams (beyond just hardware sales) provide resilience against such concerns. Additionally, the CMA's investigation mentioned in the news is not directly targeting eSims, reducing immediate regulatory pressure. However, the negative sentiment from telecom operators and potential long-term regulatory scrutiny could weigh slightly on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential to use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks, particularly with the rise of eSims.
