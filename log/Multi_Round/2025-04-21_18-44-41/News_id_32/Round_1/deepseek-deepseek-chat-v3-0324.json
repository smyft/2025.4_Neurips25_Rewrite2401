      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's revelation of a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion devices indicates continued customer acquisition, suggesting potential growth opportunities for sales across its product lines. This is a positive sign for investors, likely leading to an increase in stock price. However, being a mature company may temper expectations for massive growth, but overall, the news is optimistic. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base and acquisition of new customers indicate ongoing demand for its products. The potential for cross-selling among iPhone users suggests further growth opportunities. This positive sentiment is likely to have a slight positive impact on the share price. The probability of rising share price is estimated between 0.60 and 0.70. Other factors that may influence the price trend are not factored in though; these factors include the general market environment, any concurrent market specific news, or any factors that may pertain to the business.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates continued growth in Apple's customer base, even with its mature status.  The key takeaway is the potential for cross-selling within its existing ecosystem.  This suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth as Apple encourages iPhone users to purchase additional Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches. This is a positive signal, likely to be well-received by investors. However, the market's reaction depends on many other factors, and it's impossible to predict a certain outcome with complete accuracy. We need to consider that this is just one piece of information amongst many that will influence Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease because the news presents a positive outlook for future growth, but the magnitude is uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators typically boost investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. However, as Apple is a mature company, the market may have already priced in some of this growth, limiting the upside. The probability of a fall is low unless there are other negative factors not mentioned in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers and has a large installed base of devices, indicating potential for growth. This positive outlook on the company's growth prospects is likely to influence investor sentiment favorably. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is still able to attract new customers, which is a positive sign for the company's growth prospects. The fact that Apple's installed base of devices has reached over 2.35 billion and is still growing indicates a strong potential for further expansion. Additionally, the company's ability to convince iPhone owners to buy other Apple devices, such as Macs, iPads, or Watches, provides a potential avenue for increasing revenue. This positive news is likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price, increasing the probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
