The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices.

The key takeaway is the potential for cross-selling within its existing ecosystem.  This suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth as Apple encourages iPhone users to purchase additional Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches. This is a positive signal, likely to be well-received by investors. However, the market's reaction depends on many other factors, and it's impossible to predict a certain outcome with complete accuracy. We need to consider that this is just one piece of information amongst many that will influence Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease because the news presents a positive outlook for future growth, but the magnitude is uncertain.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```\n"
