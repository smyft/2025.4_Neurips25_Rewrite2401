      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's revelation of a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion devices indicates continued customer acquisition, suggesting potential growth opportunities for sales across its product lines. This is a positive sign for investors, likely leading to an increase in stock price. However, being a mature company may temper expectations for massive growth, but overall, the news is optimistic. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base and acquisition of new customers indicate ongoing demand for its products. The potential for cross-selling among iPhone users suggests further growth opportunities. This positive sentiment is likely to have a slight positive impact on the share price. The probability of rising share price is estimated between 0.60 and 0.70. Other factors that may influence the price trend are not factored in though; these factors include the general market environment, any concurrent market specific news, or any factors that may pertain to the business.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates continued growth in Apple's customer base, even with its mature status.  The key takeaway is the potential for cross-selling within its existing ecosystem.  This suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth as Apple encourages iPhone users to purchase additional Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches. This is a positive signal, likely to be well-received by investors. However, the market's reaction depends on many other factors, and it's impossible to predict a certain outcome with complete accuracy. We need to consider that this is just one piece of information amongst many that will influence Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease because the news presents a positive outlook for future growth, but the magnitude is uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators typically boost investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. However, as Apple is a mature company, the market may have already priced in some of this growth, limiting the upside. The probability of a fall is low unless there are other negative factors not mentioned in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers and has a large installed base of devices, indicating potential for growth. This positive outlook on the company's growth prospects is likely to influence investor sentiment favorably. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is still able to attract new customers, which is a positive sign for the company's growth prospects. The fact that Apple's installed base of devices has reached over 2.35 billion and is still growing indicates a strong potential for further expansion. Additionally, the company's ability to convince iPhone owners to buy other Apple devices, such as Macs, iPads, or Watches, provides a potential avenue for increasing revenue. This positive news is likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price, increasing the probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still attracting new customers, with an installed base of over 2.35 billion devices. This suggests ongoing demand for its products and the potential for cross-selling opportunities, which could lead to increased revenue generation. While Apple is a mature company, this growth signal is likely to create a positive investor sentiment, indicating a higher probability of stock price rise. Although some caution is warranted due to market conditions and inherent limitations of growth in mature companies, the overall implications of the news are bullish for AAPL stock. Thus, I estimate a probability of 0.70 for the stock price rising and a probability of 0.30 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news is undoubtedly positive, highlighting continued customer acquisition and growth potential within Apple's existing ecosystem through cross-selling. The consistently positive predictions in the previous round strongly reinforce this outlook. However, I'll slightly temper the probability of a rise and slightly increase the probability of a fall to acknowledge that the market has likely already priced in a portion of this potential growth, and that there might be other, unseen information impacting the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting Apple's continued growth in its installed base and the potential for cross-selling within its ecosystem.  This suggests sustained demand and future revenue growth. However, the fact that Apple is a mature company means the market may have already priced in some of this positive outlook, limiting the extent of any price increase resulting from this particular news.  The previous predictions range from 0.65 to 0.75 for the probability of a price rise, with the majority leaning towards 0.7. Considering this consensus and the inherent limitations of predicting stock prices with certainty (market conditions, other news, etc.), a conservative estimate is warranted. I will slightly adjust the optimistic consensus, accounting for the mature company factor. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base, reaching over 2.35 billion devices, driven by new customers. This indicates strong demand and potential for further growth through cross-selling of other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators are likely to boost investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook (with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.65 to 0.75) and the consensus that the news is optimistic, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. However, as Apple is a mature company, the upside may be somewhat limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers, with its installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion. This growth in the installed base, driven by new customers, suggests strong demand and potential for further growth. The company can leverage its existing ecosystem to cross-sell other products like Macs, iPads, or Watches to iPhone users. This positive growth indicator is likely to boost investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. However, as Apple is a mature company, the market may have already priced in some of this growth, but overall, the news presents a positive outlook for future growth. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers, with its installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion. This suggests continued growth opportunities for the company, particularly through cross-selling of products like Macs, iPads, and Watches to existing iPhone users. Considering the positive outlook and growth potential, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling. Reviewing previous predictions from various models, there is a consensus that the news is positive for Apple's stock, with estimated probabilities of a stock price rise ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. However, given that Apple is a mature company, the upside might be limited. Therefore, a balanced estimate, taking into account the positive news and the potential limitations due to the company's maturity, seems appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.71, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.29, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has achieved significant growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This suggests ongoing demand and indicates potential growth opportunities through cross-selling additional products to existing users. The fact that Apple is a mature company suggests that while growth may be limited by market saturation, the ability to attract new customers and the potential for increased revenue through cross-selling is a positive signal. Predictions from previous analyses show a consensus leaning toward optimistic projections, with probabilities of stock price increase ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. Balancing this good news with the maturity factor of Apple, I estimate a probability of stock price rise at 0.71 and a probability of fall at 0.29.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.69, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.31, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued ability to attract new customers and grow its installed base, suggesting ongoing demand and cross-selling opportunities. Previous predictions consistently leaned towards a positive stock price movement, with probabilities ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 for a rise. However, Apple's maturity and the potential for this information to already be priced into the stock warrants a slightly more tempered optimism. Therefore, while I still lean towards a rise, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to account for these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting Apple's continued growth in its installed base and the potential for cross-selling.  This suggests sustained demand and future revenue growth. However, Apple is a mature company, and the market may have already priced in some of this positive outlook, limiting the extent of any price increase resulting from this particular news.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (between 0.65 and 0.75).  Considering this consensus, the mature company factor, and the inherent uncertainty in stock price prediction, a conservative estimate is appropriate. I'm adjusting the optimistic consensus slightly downward to account for the mature company aspect and the potential for other unforeseen market influences.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This indicates strong demand and potential for further growth through cross-selling of other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators are likely to boost investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.

This growth in the installed base, driven by new customers, suggests strong demand and potential for further growth through cross-selling of other products like Macs, iPads, or Watches to existing iPhone users. The previous predictions from various models mostly lean towards a positive outlook, with estimated probabilities of a stock price rise ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. Considering the consensus that the news is optimistic and the potential limitations due to Apple's maturity, a balanced estimate seems appropriate. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. still finding new customers and having a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion devices indicates potential for future growth, particularly through cross-selling of other Apple products to existing iPhone users. This suggests strong demand and is likely to boost investor confidence. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.65 to 0.75, and the consensus that the news is optimistic, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.

Thus, a balanced estimate, taking into account the positive news and the potential limitations due to the company's maturity, seems appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, with a significant portion attributed to new customers. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth through cross-selling opportunities within the Apple ecosystem. The optimistic outlook presented in previous rounds of predictions, supported by multiple models, further reinforces the bullish sentiment. However, since Apple is a mature company, there is a degree of expectation that much of this growth may already be priced into the stock. Hence, while the probability of the stock rising remains relatively high, it is not without limitations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
