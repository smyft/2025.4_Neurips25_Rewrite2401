      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\nNews Content: The AI startup launched its first stand-alone consumer app, as the company tries to catch up with more established players such as OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app indicates increased competition in the AI space, which could impact Apple's AI initiatives. However, since Apple is a well-established player with a strong brand and diverse product offerings, the immediate effect on its stock price may be limited. The market may react neutrally to this news, as it does not directly involve Apple. Therefore, the probabilities of significant stock price movement are relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. While it signals increased competition in the generative AI space, Apple is a large, diversified company with its own AI initiatives. The impact is indirect and likely minimal in the short term. The market's reaction will depend on how Grok is received and whether it poses a significant threat to Apple's future AI plans, which is currently uncertain. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement, either up or down, is relatively low. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall, as increased competition is generally viewed negatively, even if the impact is small.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The news focuses on a competitor in the AI space, but Apple's business is not directly threatened by xAI's app launch. Apple's core business is in hardware and software, with a growing services segment. While Apple is investing in AI, this specific news is about a competitor's progress in a separate area of the AI market. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction due to this news is low. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this particular announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Elon Musk\u2019s xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app, which is a development in the generative AI space. While this news is about a competitor in the AI sector, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company is not mentioned in the context of this development. Apple has its own AI initiatives and ecosystem, and this news is unlikely to have a significant immediate effect on its stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it pertains to a competitor in the AI space. Given that the news does not contain any company-specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price, and considering that Apple is not mentioned in the context of AI advancements or setbacks, the news is likely to have a neutral to minimal impact on Apple's stock price. However, if there is an indirect impact, it could be that advancements in AI by other companies might put pressure on tech companies in general, but Apple has a diversified portfolio and a strong position in the market. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall market resilience and Apple's strong position, but the impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline indicates the launch of a stand-alone Grok app by xAI, a company founded by Elon Musk, which is a development in the AI sector. However, the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its current products and services. Since the news does not mention Apple Inc. or its competitors in a way that would directly impact Apple's stock price, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal. The launch of a new app by xAI may have implications for the broader tech industry, but it does not provide any significant information about Apple's financials, products, or services that would sway investor decisions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news is about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone consumer app in the generative AI race. This event does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is primarily focused on hardware and software products rather than AI startups. While AI advancements can indirectly influence the tech sector, the immediate impact on AAPL stock price would likely be minimal. There is no significant positive or negative direct correlation indicated by this news for AAPL.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app indicates increased competition in the generative AI space. However, this development does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it does not involve Apple or its products. While the competitive landscape in AI may have indirect implications for Apple, the company is well-established with a diversified portfolio and its own AI initiatives. Most analyses suggest that the immediate effect on Apple's stock price will be minimal, with probabilities leaning towards a neutral market reaction. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong market position, but overall, the probabilities of significant movement are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news of xAI launching Grok is a competitive factor in the AI space, but its direct impact on Apple is likely minimal. Apple has its own AI initiatives and a diversified business. The previous predictions consistently indicate a low impact, with most models assigning low probabilities to both rise and fall. Some models lean slightly towards a negative impact due to increased competition, while one model surprisingly predicts a higher probability of a rise. Considering the consensus and Apple's strong market position, I'll assign slightly higher probabilities than the lowest predictions, but still keep them relatively low, and slightly favor a small decrease due to the increased competition in the AI space.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news about xAI's Grok app launch is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate prospects.  While it represents increased competition in the AI space, Apple's vast and diversified business is unlikely to be significantly impacted.  The previous predictions show a consensus towards minimal impact, with probabilities of price movement in either direction clustering around 0.1.  The slight upward bias in some predictions likely reflects Apple's overall market strength and resilience to external pressures.  Given the lack of direct relevance and the consensus of minimal impact, I predict a very low probability of significant price movement in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is focused on a competitor in the AI space and does not directly involve Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's core business revolves around hardware, software, and services, with its own AI initiatives. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's operations or financials, the immediate impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The consensus from previous predictions also supports this view, with most models assigning low probabilities to significant price movements. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app primarily concerns a competitor in the AI space and does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

(AAPL) and is unlikely to have a significant immediate effect on its stock price. Apple is a well-established player with a strong brand and diverse product offerings, which reduces the potential impact of increased competition in the AI space. Considering the neutral to minimal impact of the news on Apple's stock price, and taking into account the previous predictions which also indicate a low probability of significant stock price movement, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news is about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app in the generative AI space. This event does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it pertains to a competitor in the AI sector. Apple is a diversified company with a strong focus on hardware and software, with its own AI initiatives. While the news signals increased competition in the AI space, it is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price, given the company's strong market position and diverse revenue streams. The previous predictions indicate a consensus that the news is neutral to minimal in its impact on Apple's stock price. Hence, the probabilities of the stock price moving significantly are low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app indicates increased competition in the generative AI space.

While it represents increased competition in the AI space, Apple's diversified business and existing AI initiatives mitigate the potential negative effects. Previous predictions consistently reflect this sentiment, with probabilities of significant price movement remaining low. There's a slight tendency towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to the increased competition, but Apple's strong market position provides resilience. Considering the consensus and the lack of direct relevance to Apple's core business, I'm maintaining low probabilities for both upward and downward movement, with a slight edge towards a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news about xAI's Grok app launch has minimal direct impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show a strong consensus that the impact on AAPL's stock price will be negligible.  Most models predict probabilities of price movement (both up and down) clustered around 0.1 or lower.  While increased competition in the AI space could theoretically exert some indirect pressure, Apple's diversified business and strong market position mitigate this risk.  The overall trend in predictions shows a slight leaning towards a neutral or slightly negative impact, but the magnitude is consistently predicted to be very small.  Therefore, I'm assigning low probabilities to both a price rise and a price fall, reflecting the consensus view that this news is largely irrelevant to Apple's short-term stock performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is focused on a competitor in the AI space and does not directly involve Apple Inc.

Considering this, I will assign low probabilities to both a price rise and a price fall, reflecting the consensus view that this news is largely irrelevant to Apple's short-term stock performance. However, given the slight negative sentiment due to increased competition, I will give a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news about xAI's Grok app launch has minimal direct impact on Apple.  The overwhelming consensus across multiple AI models and prediction rounds is that the effect on AAPL's stock price will be negligible.  While increased competition in the AI sector exists, Apple's diversified business and strong market position buffer it from significant negative consequences.  The slight upward bias in some predictions likely reflects Apple's overall market strength and resilience.  Given the lack of direct relevance and the consistent prediction of minimal impact across rounds, I predict very low probabilities for both a price rise and a price fall. The probabilities are converging towards a neutral position, reflecting the general irrelevance of this news to Apple's short-term stock performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is focused on a competitor in the AI space and does not directly involve Apple Inc.
