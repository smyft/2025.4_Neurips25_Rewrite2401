While it signals increased competition in the generative AI space, Apple is a large, diversified company with its own AI initiatives. The impact is indirect and likely minimal in the short term. The market's reaction will depend on how Grok is received and whether it poses a significant threat to Apple's future AI plans, which is currently uncertain. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement, either up or down, is relatively low. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall, as increased competition is generally viewed negatively, even if the impact is small.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_stay_same\": 0.3\n}\n```"
