(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks that are expected to show solid earnings growth. The mention of higher bond yields and the potential for fewer Fed rate cuts may negatively impact tech stocks, including Apple, which has already seen a decline year-to-date. Given the current market sentiment and the emphasis on defensive trades, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price falling rather than rising in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. While the overall market outlook might be positive, the article specifically highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date. The article suggests that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down, and investors may not be anticipating this change. This could lead to a further decrease in investor interest in Apple, potentially driving its stock price down. The article also mentions rising bond yields negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. The article does not mention any specific positive catalysts for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a shift in investment strategy, advocating for diversification away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple.  While Apple's performance is mentioned (down 8% YTD), the article doesn't directly predict Apple's future price movement. The core argument is that other sectors, particularly financials, are poised for stronger growth. This indirectly suggests a potential underperformance of the Mag 7, including Apple, relative to other sectors.  However, the article doesn't provide specific negative information about Apple's fundamentals. The overall market sentiment is also uncertain due to rising bond yields and potential Fed rate cuts. Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is relatively balanced, leaning slightly towards a fall due to the article's emphasis on the underperformance of the Mag 7 compared to other sectors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, citing potential overvaluation and slowing earnings growth in the Mag 7. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, and the article highlights concerns about higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations, which could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. The emphasis on financials and other sectors with stronger earnings growth prospects may divert investment away from Apple. However, Apple's strong brand and recurring revenue streams could provide some resilience. Overall, the sentiment appears bearish for Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for investors to diversify their portfolios by investing in the 493 other S&P 500 stocks beyond the 'Magnificent Seven', which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article highlights that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's stock is down 8% year to date. The overall sentiment suggests a cautious or negative outlook for the Mag 7 stocks, including Apple, due to changing market narratives and valuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests that investors should consider the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to potentially inflated tech expectations and higher bond yields. The article highlights that the 493 other stocks could post an 11% earnings growth this year, which may not be reflected in their current valuations. Additionally, the financials sector, which is not dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven', is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter. This information implies that the focus of investors might shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven' towards other stocks with potentially stronger growth prospects at more reasonable valuations. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising might be lower compared to the probability of it falling as investors diversify their portfolios and look for value in other sectors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks within the S&P 500, favoring the remaining 493 stocks due to better potential growth and valuation considerations. Given that Apple (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and the article implies that these stocks might face challenges due to factors like higher bond yields and slower earnings growth, it suggests a cautious outlook for AAPL. However, individual performance can vary.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks that are expected to show stronger earnings growth. The mention of rising bond yields and the potential for fewer Fed rate cuts adds to the bearish sentiment for tech stocks like Apple, which has already seen an 8% decline year-to-date. The overall tone of the article suggests that investors may be looking for better opportunities outside of the Mag 7, which could further pressure Apple's stock price. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment from previous rounds, coupled with the news article's emphasis on shifting investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) due to factors like higher bond yields, slowing earnings growth, and inflated tech expectations, reinforces the likelihood of a stock price decline for Apple. The article explicitly mentions Apple's YTD decline of 8%, further supporting this view. While the article doesn't provide specific negative news about Apple's fundamentals, the overall tone and the comparison with other potentially more attractive investment opportunities suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a shift in investor preference away from the 'Magnificent Seven', including Apple, towards other S&P 500 companies with potentially stronger earnings growth and more attractive valuations.  While the article doesn't directly predict Apple's price movement, the overall tone is negative for the Mag 7.  Apple is already down 8% YTD, and the article highlights concerns about higher bond yields and slowing growth for the Mag 7, which could further pressure Apple's stock price.  The consensus among previous models is also bearish, with probabilities of a price fall consistently higher than those of a price rise.  While Apple's strong fundamentals could offer some resilience, the prevailing market sentiment and the article's focus on alternative investment opportunities suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline in the short term.  Considering the previous predictions and the article's content, a slightly more conservative estimate of the probability of a price fall is warranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to concerns about higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations, and slowing earnings growth. The article highlights that the 493 other S&P 500 stocks could outperform with 11% earnings growth in 2025, compared to the Mag 7's expected 18% growth, which is a slowdown from 25% in 2024. Additionally, Apple's stock is down 8% year-to-date, and the financials sector is expected to report strong earnings growth, potentially diverting investment away from tech stocks like Apple. While Apple's strong brand and recurring revenue streams provide some resilience, the overall sentiment appears bearish in the short term. Given the shift in market narrative and investor focus, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc.

The overall sentiment suggests a cautious or negative outlook for the Mag7 stocks, including Apple, due to changing market narratives and valuations. The emphasis on financials and other sectors with stronger earnings growth prospects may divert investment away from Apple. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower compared to the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks with potentially stronger growth prospects and more reasonable valuations. The article highlights Apple's underperformance, with its stock down 8% year-to-date, and mentions concerns about higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations, which could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. Considering the overall sentiment and the emphasis on defensive trades, the probability of Apple's stock price falling appears to be higher than the probability of it rising. However, the predictions from other models indicate a range of opinions, with some models suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price fall and others a more balanced view. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs and the information provided, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc., to the remaining 493 S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that Apple's earnings growth is expected to slow down and is already down 8% year-to-date. Additionally, rising bond yields and potentially fewer Fed rate cuts could negatively impact tech stocks. The emphasis on financials and other sectors with stronger earnings growth could further detract from Apple's appeal. While Apple's strong brand and recurring revenue streams offer some support, the overall market sentiment and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance point towards a higher likelihood of a price decrease.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks that are expected to show stronger earnings growth. With Apple already down 8% year-to-date and concerns about rising bond yields and slowing earnings growth for the Mag 7, the sentiment appears bearish for Apple. The emphasis on financials and other sectors with better growth prospects suggests that investors may seek opportunities outside of Apple, further increasing the likelihood of a price decline. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment across previous rounds, coupled with the news article's emphasis on shifting investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) due to factors like higher bond yields, slowing earnings growth, and inflated tech expectations, reinforces the likelihood of a stock price decline for Apple. The article explicitly mentions Apple's YTD decline of 8%, further supporting this view. While the article doesn't provide specific negative news about Apple's fundamentals, the overall tone and the comparison with other potentially more attractive investment opportunities suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise. The trend of previous predictions also leans heavily towards a price decrease. Therefore, I am maintaining a high probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a shift in investor sentiment away from the 'Magnificent Seven', including Apple, towards other S&P 500 companies perceived as offering better growth prospects and valuations.  While not explicitly negative towards Apple, the article highlights several factors that could negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term. These include: Apple's year-to-date decline of 8%, the expected slowdown in earnings growth for the Mag 7, rising bond yields (which typically negatively correlate with tech stocks), and the overall market shift towards sectors like financials.  The consistent bearish sentiment from previous prediction rounds further reinforces this negative outlook. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand recognition offer some resilience, the prevailing market sentiment and the article's emphasis on alternative investment opportunities suggest a higher probability of a price decline than a rise in the near term.
