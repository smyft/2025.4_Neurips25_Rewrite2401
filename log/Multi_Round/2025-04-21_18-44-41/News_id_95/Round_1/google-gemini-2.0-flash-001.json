A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Verizon's strategic partnerships to enhance its AI capabilities, which may indirectly benefit Apple as a competitor in the tech space. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's operations or market position. Given that Apple has shown a positive movement of 3.2% recently, and considering the overall market sentiment towards AI investments, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price may continue to rise. However, the potential for a market correction or reaction to broader tech trends could lead to a slight chance of decline. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of stability or slight growth rather than significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's AI strategy and partnerships with major tech companies like Google, Meta, and NVIDIA. While this is positive for Verizon and the AI ecosystem in general, the direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is less clear. Apple is not mentioned as a direct partner in Verizon's AI Connect initiative. The article mentions Apple closed up 3.2% in the previous session, but this is historical data and not directly related to the Verizon news. The overall market sentiment seems mixed, with some stocks rising and others falling. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, but not significantly driven by this specific Verizon announcement. The article also mentions Microsoft potentially acquiring TikTok, which could have a broader impact on the tech landscape, but its direct effect on Apple is uncertain.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's investment in AI infrastructure and partnerships with major players like Google Cloud and NVIDIA. While this is positive for the overall AI sector, the direct impact on Apple is minimal.  The article mentions Apple's stock price rose 3.2% on the day, but this is likely due to broader market factors or other company-specific news not detailed here. The news about Verizon's AI initiatives is not directly relevant to Apple's core business or future prospects. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this specific news is considered low, with the likelihood of a price change in either direction being roughly equal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Verizon's strategic partnerships to boost AI capacity, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the broader context of AI advancements and partnerships in the tech sector could have a positive spillover effect on major tech companies like Apple, given its involvement in AI and cloud services. Apple's stock recently closed up 3.2%, indicating positive momentum. The news does not present any direct negative implications for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact is likely muted due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Verizon's unveiling of its AI Connect platform, which is aimed at supporting businesses with AI workloads. Although the news is primarily about Verizon, it mentions other companies such as Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr as strategic partners. The article also mentions Apple's stock price movement, which rose 3.2% to $229.86. The news about Verizon's AI strategy and partnerships may have a positive impact on the stock prices of companies involved in the AI and cloud computing space, including Apple. However, the article does not provide a direct link between Verizon's announcement and Apple's stock price movement. Considering the general trend of growing demand for AI and cloud computing, and Apple's existing involvement in these areas, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the tech industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Verizon's strategic move to enhance its AI capabilities through partnerships with major tech companies. This initiative could have indirect positive effects on companies involved in AI technology and infrastructure, including Apple. However, Apple's direct involvement in AI through Verizon's platform is not explicitly mentioned. The recent performance of Apple shows an upward trend, closing up 3.2%, which might suggest market confidence. Overall, while there is a positive sentiment linked to AI advancements, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price due to this specific news is less clear.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
