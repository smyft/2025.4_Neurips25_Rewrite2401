A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and concerns over the lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a decrease in investor confidence, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple (AAPL) due to a downgrade by Oppenheimer. The reasons cited are increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. These are significant concerns for a company like Apple, as China is a major market and AI is a key area of growth and innovation. A downgrade from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' suggests that Oppenheimer no longer expects Apple to outperform the market. This negative sentiment, coupled with the timing just before earnings, increases the likelihood of a stock price decline. However, the actual earnings report could still surprise positively, mitigating the negative impact. The market's reaction will also depend on the specific details and guidance provided during the earnings call. Given the negative pre-earnings sentiment, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform is a negative catalyst.  The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are significant concerns for investors.  While Apple's earnings report could potentially offset this negative sentiment, the downgrade itself suggests a less optimistic outlook from a reputable analyst firm.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise, although the actual impact will depend heavily on the upcoming earnings report.  A strong earnings beat could mitigate the negative impact of the downgrade, but a miss would likely exacerbate the downward pressure.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features. Analyst downgrades typically have a negative impact on investor sentiment, especially when they highlight competitive pressures and technological shortcomings. Given that this downgrade comes just ahead of earnings, it may amplify concerns among investors about the company's near-term performance. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. A downgrade by a reputable analyst firm typically has a negative impact on the stock price as it may lead to decreased investor confidence. Additionally, the downgrade comes ahead of Apple's earnings report, which could create uncertainty and potentially negative expectations among investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer analysts from Outperform to Perform, citing increased competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. This downgrade, especially just ahead of earnings, could negatively impact investor confidence. The mention of competition in China and the perceived lack of innovation in AI could lead to concerns about Apple's future growth and market share. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has been downgraded by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Downgrades often lead to a decrease in investor confidence, which can cause the stock price to drop, especially before the earnings report when investors might be cautious. This news could potentially create a negative sentiment among investors, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' indicates a negative outlook, primarily due to increased competition in China and concerns over the lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to decreased investor confidence, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given the consensus among various analyses predicting a higher probability of a price decline, I estimate a significant likelihood of the stock price falling in response to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds strongly indicates a negative outlook for Apple due to the Oppenheimer downgrade, citing competition in China and a lack of AI features. The timing of the downgrade just before earnings amplifies the potential negative impact. While a positive earnings surprise could mitigate the damage, the prevailing sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a price decline. Given the consistent predictions across various models in the previous round, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly stronger negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The Oppenheimer downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform is a significant negative catalyst.  The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are valid concerns. While Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base could mitigate some of the negative impact, the pre-earnings timing of the downgrade increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction.  The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price fall, ranging from 0.65 to 0.8 probability.  Considering the negative sentiment and the weight of the analyst downgrade, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a positive surprise from the earnings report.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, reinforcing my assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features, is a significant negative signal for investors.

(AAPL). This downgrade, especially just ahead of the earnings report, could lead to decreased investor confidence and potentially a decline in stock price.

Given the information and the general sentiment from the downgrade and previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Apple being downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features, suggests a negative outlook for the company.

Although the actual earnings report could influence short-term movements, the current negative sentiment is a strong indicator of potential downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc.
