(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the AI landscape has raised questions about the sustainability of valuations in mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. While the news suggests a potential shift in investor focus towards European equities, it also indicates that the AI enthusiasm may be evolving, which could lead to volatility in tech stocks. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and is currently priced for perfection, there is a risk of downward pressure on its stock price. However, the overall market stabilization and the potential for broader earnings growth could support a moderate probability of price rise. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the uncertainties introduced by DeepSeek's emergence.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of DeepSeek on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. While Apple's App Store is mentioned as the platform where DeepSeek gained popularity, the core argument is about a potential shift in investment focus away from mega-cap tech companies (including those in the US) towards European equities. The news suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could challenge the dominance of existing AI models and potentially reduce the need for massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies. This could lead to a slight negative sentiment towards companies like Apple, as it implies a possible shift in investor focus and potentially lower growth expectations for the 'Magnificent 7'. However, the impact on Apple is indirect. The primary beneficiary, according to the analysis, would be European stocks. The negative impact on Apple is tempered by the fact that it is still a major player in the tech space and its App Store remains a key platform. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not dramatically so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader market, particularly its potential to shift investment away from the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech companies, including Apple.  While DeepSeek's success challenges the narrative of massive AI investment being necessary, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's fundamentals or prospects. The main point is that the shift in investor sentiment towards European stocks, as suggested by Citi, is a macro trend and not directly related to Apple's performance.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect.  Any price movement would be more likely due to broader market fluctuations than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, with Nvidia being a significant decliner, indicating potential investor concerns about AI competition. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus and potential concerns over AI competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model that has gained popularity and potentially challenges the dominance of mega-cap tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the AI space. While the news does not directly mention Apple's stock performance, it implies that the AI landscape is evolving, which could affect companies like Apple that are heavily invested in AI. The article also mentions that Citi analysts believe the AI trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in mega-cap tech companies, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock is uncertain, and the news does not provide a clear direction for the company's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese start-up that has developed an AI model that can compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, and its potential impact on European stocks. The article suggests that this development could lead to a broader distribution of earnings gains beyond the 'Magnificent 7' mega-cap tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), and potentially benefit European stocks. However, the article does not directly imply a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Given that the news is more focused on the broader market implications and the potential for European stocks to outperform, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low. Nevertheless, the fact that DeepSeek's AI model is available on Apple's App Store and has gained popularity could be seen as a mildly positive indicator for Apple, as it may drive engagement and revenue for the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential impact of the emergence of DeepSeek on European stocks and the broader AI industry. It suggests a shift in focus towards European equities and away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple. While Apple is mentioned as part of the context regarding DeepSeek's popularity on their App Store, the overall sentiment is not directly related to Apple's performance. Therefore, the news does not provide clear positive or negative signals specific to Apple's stock price movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek raises concerns about the sustainability of valuations for mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. Analysts suggest a potential shift in investor focus towards European equities, which could lead to reduced growth expectations for the 'Magnificent 7', of which Apple is a part. While the news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals, it introduces uncertainty regarding the competitive landscape in AI, which could negatively affect investor sentiment towards Apple. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the overall market context, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to these uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential shift in investment focus from US mega-cap tech companies like Apple towards European equities due to the emergence of DeepSeek. While DeepSeek's success on Apple's App Store is mentioned, the core argument revolves around a possible re-evaluation of AI spending and a broader distribution of earnings. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a fall due to concerns about AI competition and a shift in investor focus, while others see a minimal direct impact on Apple. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the overall context, I believe the negative sentiment is slightly overblown. While there might be some short-term volatility, Apple's strong fundamentals and diverse revenue streams should mitigate any significant negative impact. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly more balanced view, acknowledging the potential for a slight dip but also recognizing Apple's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential shift in investor sentiment from US mega-cap tech companies, including Apple, towards European equities due to the emergence of DeepSeek.  While Apple is mentioned (DeepSeek's popularity on the App Store), the impact on AAPL is indirect and likely minimal.  The core argument is about a broader market trend, not Apple-specific news. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a price fall, primarily due to the potential for reduced investor focus on the 'Magnificent 7'. However, the lack of direct negative news about Apple itself, coupled with the continued relevance of its App Store, suggests that the impact will be muted.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the indirect nature of the news, a neutral probability is most appropriate, with a slight edge towards a price fall reflecting the overall cautious sentiment expressed in previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks, suggesting a shift in investor focus away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple. While Apple is mentioned as the platform where DeepSeek gained popularity, the core argument is about broader market trends rather than direct implications for Apple's fundamentals. The news raises questions about the sustainability of massive AI spending by tech giants, which could indirectly affect Apple's valuation. However, the impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's diversified business model and strong market position. Previous predictions indicate a slight bias towards a potential fall in Apple's stock price due to the evolving AI landscape and shifting investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is expected to be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model that has gained popularity on Apple's App Store, and its potential impact on the AI landscape and stock market. While the news does not directly criticize Apple, it suggests that the AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings in mega-cap tech companies like Apple. Citi analysts believe this trend could benefit European stocks, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, there is a risk of downward pressure on Apple's stock price due to reduced investor focus and potential concerns over AI competition. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock is uncertain, and the news does not provide a clear direction for the company's stock price movement. Considering the mixed implications and the focus on European stocks, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek and its potential to challenge the dominance of mega-cap tech companies, including Apple, introduces uncertainty into the market. However, the news primarily focuses on the broader implications for European stocks and the AI industry rather than directly impacting Apple's fundamentals. Considering the indirect impact and the mixed predictions from other models, which suggest a range of possible effects from mildly positive to mildly negative, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling should be relatively balanced. Given that some models predict a higher probability of a fall due to the potential shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks, and others see minimal direct impact, a moderate probability for both rise and fall seems appropriate. The overall market context, including stabilization and potential broader earnings growth, also supports a balanced view.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its potential impact on the AI landscape and investor focus. The news suggests that DeepSeek's popularity could lead to a broader distribution of earnings gains, potentially shifting investor attention away from mega-cap tech companies such as Apple towards European equities. Multiple predictions from different models indicate a range of probabilities, but most lean towards a higher likelihood of a stock price fall. Some models attribute this to the uncertainty around AI spending and potential competition, while others see it as a minor factor with limited direct impact on Apple's stock. Overall, the analysis leans towards a moderate probability of a stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek raises concerns about the sustainability of valuations for mega-cap tech companies, including Apple.

Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly more balanced view, acknowledging the potential for a slight dip but also recognizing Apple's resilience. Given the slight negative sentiment, I will give a slightly higher probability of stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader market, particularly the potential shift of investment from US mega-cap tech companies (including Apple) to European equities.  While Apple is mentioned (DeepSeek's popularity on its App Store), the impact on AAPL is indirect and likely minimal. The core argument is about a macro trend, not Apple-specific news.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to potential reduced investor focus on the 'Magnificent 7'. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diverse revenue streams should mitigate any significant negative impact.  The consensus among previous models suggests a higher probability of a price fall, but the magnitude of this fall is debated.  Considering the indirect nature of the news and the overall market context (stabilization and potential broader earnings growth), a moderate probability of a price fall is most likely, but not a dramatic one.  The probability of a rise is lower, reflecting the overall cautious sentiment and the lack of direct positive news for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its potential impact on European stocks and the broader AI landscape.
