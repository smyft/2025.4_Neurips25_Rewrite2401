(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?
