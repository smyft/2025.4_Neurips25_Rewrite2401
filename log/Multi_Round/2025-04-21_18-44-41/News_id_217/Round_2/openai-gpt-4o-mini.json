A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's Q4 sales in China have reportedly dropped, which is a negative signal for the company's performance in a key market. This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a potential decline in stock price. However, the overall market is higher, which may provide some support for AAPL. Given the negative news specifically about sales, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline presents mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). While the overall market is up (indicated by 'Wall Street's major market averages were higher'), the specific mention of a reported drop in Q4 China sales is a negative indicator. China is a crucial market for Apple, and a sales decline there could significantly impact revenue and investor sentiment. Without knowing the magnitude of the sales drop, it's difficult to assess the full impact. However, the negative news regarding China sales likely outweighs the positive market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall further limits the ability to make a more informed assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is partially positive and partially negative.  The positive aspect is that the overall market (Wall Street) is higher. This suggests a generally positive market sentiment which could support Apple's stock price. However, the negative aspect is the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales. China is a significant market for Apple, and a decline in sales there could negatively impact the company's overall performance and stock price.  Without access to the full article detailing the magnitude of the China sales drop and further market context, it's difficult to definitively assess the impact.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall due to the negative news being more specific to Apple's performance, while acknowledging the positive overall market trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q4 sales in China have reportedly dropped. China is a significant market for Apple, and a decline in sales could negatively impact investor sentiment and the company's revenue. This negative news is likely to weigh on the stock price in the short term. However, the overall market averages were higher, which might provide some offsetting positive sentiment. Given the direct negative impact of declining sales in a key market, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales reportedly dropped. This information could be perceived negatively by investors, as a drop in sales in a significant market like China could impact Apple's revenue and growth prospects. Typically, negative sales reports lead to a decrease in stock price. However, the overall market trend mentioned is positive, with major market averages being higher. The impact of this news on Apple's stock price might be limited if the overall market sentiment remains strong. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the specific negative news about Apple's Q4 China sales, but the overall positive market trend might mitigate a significant drop.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales reportedly dropped, which could be a negative indicator for the company's stock price. However, the overall market averages were higher around midday, which might offset some of the negative impact. Considering the potential negative effect of the sales drop in China, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.'s Q4 China sales reportedly dropped, which could negatively impact the stock price as China is a significant market for Apple. However, the broader market context shows that major market averages were higher around midday, suggesting a positive sentiment. The negative news about China sales outweighs the general market trend for Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a reported drop in Apple's Q4 sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. This negative information is likely to weigh heavily on investor sentiment and could lead to a decline in stock price. While the overall market is showing positive trends, the specific negative news about sales in a key market outweighs this broader sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that the negative news regarding Apple's Q4 China sales outweighs the positive market sentiment. The drop in China sales is a significant concern, as China is a crucial market for Apple. While the overall market being up might provide some support, the specific negative news about Apple's performance is likely to have a greater impact. Given the consistent predictions of a higher probability of the stock falling, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect this strong sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  While the overall market is up, the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales is a significant negative factor.  China is a crucial market for Apple, and a decline there could impact revenue and investor sentiment.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.  The lack of detail regarding the magnitude of the sales drop makes precise prediction difficult, but the negative news about a key market likely outweighs the positive general market trend.  Considering the consensus of previous models and the weight of the negative news, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed sentiment for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the overall market averages were higher, which could provide some support to the stock. On the other hand, the reported drop in Q4 China sales is a significant negative factor, as China is a crucial market for Apple. Previous predictions from other models consistently estimated a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 for a price fall. This consensus suggests that the negative impact of the China sales drop outweighs the positive market sentiment. Given this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q4 sales in China have reportedly dropped. China is a significant market for Apple, and a decline in sales could negatively impact investor sentiment and the company's revenue. This negative news is likely to weigh on the stock price in the short term. However, the overall market averages were higher, which might provide some offsetting positive sentiment. Considering the direct negative impact of declining sales in a key market and the general positive market trend, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a drop in Apple's Q4 sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. This negative news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a potential decline in stock price. Although the overall market averages were higher, which might provide some support for AAPL, the specific negative news about Apple's sales in China is likely to have a more direct impact on the company's stock price. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a reported drop in Apple's Q4 sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. This negative news could lead to decreased investor confidence and potentially impact the stock price negatively. Although the overall market is showing positive trends, the specific negative news about sales in China is likely to have a stronger influence on the stock price movement. Previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, with the majority estimating the probability of falling to be around 0.6 to 0.7.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
