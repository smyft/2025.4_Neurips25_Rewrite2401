(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Overall, the positive developments in AI leadership may outweigh the negative outlook on iPhone sales, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is strengthening its AI leadership with 'Apple Intelligence,' a BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features, leading to lowered iPhone unit estimates. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating based on strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. The article also highlights the intense competition in the AI space, particularly from China, which could put pressure on Apple to innovate faster. The article also mentions that other AI stocks may hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term due to the lowered iPhone estimates and competitive pressures, but the 'Buy' rating and long-term potential mitigate the downside.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with 'Apple Intelligence' and its strong position among AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and the slow rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 also contributes to a negative sentiment.  However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating citing strong profit margins and future improvements. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting a potential for growth but also acknowledging significant headwinds. The article's focus on other AI stocks with potentially higher returns further dilutes the positive impact of Apple's AI initiatives on its stock price. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strengthening position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could be seen as a positive development. However, the article also mentions a lowered price target by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan due to weak iPhone sales and a staggered rollout of AI features, which may temper investor enthusiasm. The mixed signals from the news\u2014strong AI leadership versus near-term sales challenges\u2014suggest a balanced impact on the stock price. Given Apple's strong profit margins and future prospects, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the near-term uncertainty keeps both probabilities relatively close.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strengthening AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. Additionally, it mentions that BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm's price target on Apple to $253 from $256 but maintained a 'Buy' rating due to the company's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. The article also highlights the competitive landscape in AI, particularly with China's advancements. However, it does not provide a direct negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive view of Apple's AI advancements and its resilience in the market, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strengthening leadership in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. Despite a lowered price target by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating on the shares, citing strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. The article also mentions the competitive AI landscape, with China's DeepSeek lab unveiling a free, open-source large-language model that outperformed models from Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. However, Apple's commitment to AI and its strong financials suggest a positive outlook. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the company's AI advancements and strong financial position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence. Despite concerns raised by the analyst regarding a weak macro environment and the staged rollout of AI features, Apple still holds a strong position with a significant number of hedge funds holding its stock. The news suggests potential for growth despite immediate challenges, which could positively impact investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. While some analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating based on strong profit margins and future improvements, the competitive landscape, particularly with advancements from China, adds pressure. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a balanced outlook, but the positive developments in AI leadership may outweigh the negative short-term concerns, leading to a slightly higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On the one hand, Apple is making strides in AI with 'Apple Intelligence,' which is generally positive. However, a BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and a staggered rollout of AI features, leading to lowered iPhone unit estimates. The analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future improvements. The competition in the AI space, particularly from China, is also a factor. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more positive outlook, but the negative factors still weigh in. I will adjust the probabilities slightly upwards, but not significantly, given the conflicting signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The launch of Apple Intelligence is positive, suggesting Apple is actively competing in the growing AI market.  However, the lowered price target and reduced iPhone sales estimates from BofA Securities highlight near-term challenges. The analyst's maintained 'Buy' rating suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, driven by strong profit margins and future improvements.  The intense competition in the AI sector, particularly from China, adds uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.4 to 0.65 for a price rise, and the mixed signals in the news itself, a moderate probability of a price rise is most reasonable. The probability of a price fall is also significant due to the near-term concerns.  The overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI initiatives, but the uncertainty warrants a probability closer to 0.5 for both rise and fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is strengthening its AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could attract investor interest and drive the stock price up.

On the negative side, the lowered iPhone unit estimates due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features could weigh on short-term performance. The competitive AI landscape, particularly advancements from China, also adds uncertainty. Overall, while there are challenges, the company's strong fundamentals and AI initiatives provide a more optimistic outlook, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.575, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.425, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is a positive development. However, it also mentions a lowered price target by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features. Despite this, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating citing strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. The competitive landscape in AI, particularly with China's advancements, is also noted. Considering the overall positive view of Apple's AI advancements and its resilience in the market, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the near-term uncertainty keeps both probabilities relatively close.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the downgrade in iPhone unit estimates and the mention of a weak macro environment may create concerns about short-term performance. Considering the mixed signals from the news, the overall positive view of Apple's AI advancements, and its strong financial position, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. Additionally, the predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a price fall. Taking into account the variety of perspectives, I have adjusted my estimate to reflect a balanced view.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's efforts to strengthen its position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence. This is viewed positively and aligns with Apple's efforts to remain competitive in the AI space. However, there are concerns regarding a weak macro environment, lowered iPhone unit estimates, and increased competition from China. Despite these concerns, the BofA analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating due to strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. The mixed signals, with positive developments in AI leadership versus near-term sales challenges, suggest a balanced impact on the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's advancements in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is a positive development that could attract investor interest.

The launch of Apple Intelligence is a positive catalyst, indicating the company's commitment to AI and potential for future growth. However, the lowered price target by BofA, citing a weak macro environment and staggered AI rollout impacting iPhone sales, introduces a significant headwind. The analyst's continued 'Buy' rating offers some reassurance, highlighting Apple's strong fundamentals. The competitive AI landscape, particularly China's advancements, adds further uncertainty. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight trend towards a more positive outlook, but the negative factors still weigh in. I will adjust the probabilities slightly upwards, but not significantly, given the conflicting signals. The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.65 for a price rise, with the most recent round showing a slight increase in optimism. I'll place my prediction slightly above the average of the last round, acknowledging the positive AI news but remaining cautious due to the iPhone sales concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The launch of Apple Intelligence is a positive development, showcasing Apple's commitment to the growing AI market and potentially attracting investor interest.  However, the lowered iPhone sales estimates and the analyst's lowered price target, despite maintaining a 'Buy' rating, highlight near-term challenges.  The weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features add further uncertainty.  The intense competition in the AI sector, particularly from China's advancements, also presents a headwind.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities and a slight upward trend towards a more positive outlook in the second round, I've taken a balanced approach. The positive AI news is tempered by the near-term concerns regarding iPhone sales and the broader economic climate.  The 'Buy' rating from BofA suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, but the short-term uncertainty is significant. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the potential benefits of Apple's AI initiatives, but acknowledging the considerable near-term headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI sector with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is a positive development.
