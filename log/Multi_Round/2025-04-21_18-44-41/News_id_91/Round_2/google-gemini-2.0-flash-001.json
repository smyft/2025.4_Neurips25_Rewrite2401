(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\nNews Content: Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI advancements without the heavy investments that other tech giants are making. Analysts from Baird suggest that the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on Apple is limited, which could alleviate investor concerns about competition in the AI space. Additionally, the potential for generative AI to enhance product upgrades may positively influence Apple's stock. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI without massive capital expenditure, mitigating concerns raised by DeepSeek's emergence. The article highlights Apple's strategic advantage in leveraging generative AI for product upgrades. While DeepSeek's success is a 'wake-up call,' Apple's relatively lower AI spending compared to peers is presented as a strength, not a weakness, given its reliance on third-party data centers. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty, but the Baird analysis provides a positive outlook. Given the positive sentiment and strategic positioning, a rise in stock price is more likely than a fall. However, the overall market sentiment and the upcoming earnings report can influence the stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI advancements without significant capital expenditure, unlike its competitors.  This is viewed positively, as it implies Apple can leverage AI opportunities while maintaining its strong financial position. The emergence of DeepSeek, while initially causing market concern, actually strengthens Apple's position by highlighting the potential inefficiency of massive AI investments by other tech giants.  Apple's reliance on third-party data centers for some AI work is presented as a cost-effective strategy.  However, the overall market reaction to DeepSeek's emergence introduces uncertainty. While the news is generally positive for Apple, the upcoming earnings report holds significant weight, and any negative surprises could outweigh the positive sentiment from this news.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is seen as 'well-positioned' to benefit from AI without heavy investments, unlike its Big Tech peers. Analysts suggest that DeepSeek's emergence has limited competitive impact on Apple, and generative AI could even drive product upgrades. Apple's capital expenditures are modest compared to peers, and it uses third-party data centers, reducing costs. The positive sentiment from Baird and the potential for AI to boost Apple's product cycle suggest a favorable outlook.

Baird's analysis highlights Apple's strategic advantage in the AI space:  they can benefit from AI advancements without the massive capital expenditures of competitors.  DeepSeek's emergence, while initially causing market-wide concern, actually strengthens Apple's position by highlighting the potential inefficiency of massive AI investments. Apple's relatively modest AI spending and reliance on third-party data centers are presented as strengths.  However, several factors introduce uncertainty.  The upcoming earnings report is crucial; negative surprises could outweigh the positive sentiment from this news.  Also, the overall market reaction to DeepSeek and the broader AI landscape remains unpredictable.  Considering the previous predictions, which largely favor a price rise (averaging around 0.65), and incorporating the uncertainties, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downward to account for the risk associated with the upcoming earnings report and general market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc.
