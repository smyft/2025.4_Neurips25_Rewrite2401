The tech giant is set to report its December quarter revenue, which Wall Street is forecasting will grow by 4 percent from the same period last year.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BOM:542066.\n\nTD Cowen analysts said low-cost AI models could play a role in the 2025 calendar year and discussed their role in driving mobile device upgrades.

TD Cowen, a reputable firm, raised its price target significantly, indicating strong belief in Apple's future performance.  The positive outlook on revenue growth, particularly in the Services segment, further supports this.  While regulatory risks are mentioned, the positive factors related to AI innovation and the strength of the Services segment seem to outweigh this concern. The 5 warning signs detected by GuruFocus are not detailed, so their impact is uncertain and needs further investigation before being factored into the probability.
