      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for the tech sector, with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025, which could support current valuations. Despite concerns about deceleration in growth and the impact of DeepSeek, the overall sentiment is optimistic. This suggests a higher probability of stock price rise for Apple Inc. However, the uncertainty surrounding growth and valuation erosion could lead to some investors being cautious, which introduces a moderate probability of stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for the tech sector, including Apple. While the headline suggests positive earnings growth, the content reveals underlying concerns about slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the impact of new market entrants like DeepSeek. Patel's projection of 20% earnings growth is a positive signal, but it's tempered by her earlier expectation of deceleration and existing uncertainties. The market's initial negative reaction to DeepSeek suggests sensitivity to competitive pressures. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly favored, but not overwhelmingly so, as the positive outlook is balanced by existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader tech sector (XLK), not specifically Apple. While a 20% earnings growth projection for Big Tech in 2025 is positive, it's a future prediction and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of 'erosion' in PE ratios and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact introduces downside risk.  The article lacks specific information about Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted compared to a news item directly concerning Apple. We should expect the market to react to the overall tech sector sentiment, which is cautiously optimistic.  A slight positive bias is assumed due to the overall positive outlook for the sector, but the uncertainty remains a significant factor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. The portfolio manager acknowledges some uncertainty due to DeepSeek's impact but remains optimistic, noting that new product entries historically increase demand. While there are concerns about valuation erosion due to slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts, the overall tone is positive. Given this, the stock is more likely to rise than fall in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Big Tech, with a portfolio manager predicting 20% earnings growth in 2025. This optimism could lead to increased investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The overall tech sector is rebounding from recent losses, and the portfolio manager believes current valuations are justified by expected growth. While there is uncertainty regarding the impact of new AI models, historical trends suggest that new product entries tend to increase demand across the sector. Given this positive outlook, it is likely that AAPL's stock price will rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that the technology sector, including Big Tech companies like Apple Inc., is expected to experience 20% earnings growth in 2025. This optimistic outlook, combined with the historical trend of new product entries creating increased demand, could lead to a rise in stock prices. Although there are concerns about valuation and the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model, the portfolio manager's projection of 20% earnings growth could justify current valuations and drive up stock prices. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on the tech sector, with projections of 20% earnings growth in 2025 for Big Tech companies. While there are uncertainties surrounding the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model, the overall sentiment from the portfolio manager is optimistic. This could positively influence investor confidence and potentially lead to an increase in Apple Inc.'s stock price. However, the recent market reaction to DeepSeek's AI model suggests some volatility in the short term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for the tech sector, with a projected 20% earnings growth for 2025, which could support current valuations for Apple Inc. However, there are concerns about deceleration in growth and the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model, which has caused volatility in the market. While the overall sentiment is optimistic, the uncertainty surrounding growth and valuation erosion introduces some risk. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise, but with a significant chance of a fall due to existing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for the tech sector, with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. This is a strong indicator that could drive investor confidence and increase stock prices. However, there are some caveats. The article mentions concerns about slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's AI model. The previous rounds of predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, but with varying degrees of confidence. Considering the positive earnings growth projection and the slightly positive bias in previous predictions, I will lean towards a higher probability of a rise, but temper it slightly due to the existing uncertainties and the mixed opinions in the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the tech sector, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.  However, this is a future projection and doesn't guarantee immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The news also highlights uncertainties: slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the disruptive potential of DeepSeek's AI model.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning slightly positive but with significant uncertainty.  Considering the lack of Apple-specific information and the inherent volatility of the market, a conservative estimate is warranted.  The overall positive sentiment is tempered by the uncertainties and the fact that the news focuses on the broader tech sector, not Apple specifically.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for the tech sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The projection of 20% earnings growth in 2025 for Big Tech is a strong positive signal, which could justify current valuations and boost investor confidence. However, there are concerns about valuation erosion, slowing growth, and the uncertain impact of DeepSeek's new AI model. Historical trends suggest that new product entries tend to increase demand, which could benefit Apple. The overall sentiment from the portfolio manager is optimistic, but the market's initial negative reaction to DeepSeek indicates some volatility. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for the tech sector, including Apple Inc.

The portfolio manager's optimism, despite acknowledging some uncertainty due to DeepSeek's impact, and the historical trend of new product entries increasing demand, contribute to a positive sentiment. However, concerns about valuation erosion and the impact of DeepSeek introduce some uncertainty. Considering the overall positive outlook and the rebound of the tech sector from recent losses, the probability of the stock price rising is favored. The predictions from other models also indicate a slight to moderate positive bias, with probabilities of a stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Given this information, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is estimated, taking into account both the positive outlook and the existing uncertainties.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on the tech sector, including Apple Inc., with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. While there are uncertainties surrounding the impact of DeepSeek's new AI model and concerns about valuation erosion, the overall sentiment remains optimistic. The portfolio manager projects that this growth could justify current valuations and suggests that new product entries typically increase demand. Although there is some caution due to recent market reactions and existing uncertainties, the majority of the predictions indicate a higher likelihood of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for the tech sector, with a projected 20% earnings growth for 2025, which could support current valuations for Apple Inc.

However, there are some caveats, including concerns about slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the potential impact of DeepSeek's AI model. The previous rounds of predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, but with varying degrees of confidence. Considering the positive earnings growth projection and the slightly positive bias in previous predictions, I will lean towards a higher probability of a rise, but temper it slightly due to the existing uncertainties and the mixed opinions in the previous rounds. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight decrease in the probability of stock price rising, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is positive overall for the tech sector, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.  This is a future projection, however, and doesn't guarantee immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The news also highlights uncertainties: slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the disruptive potential of DeepSeek's AI model.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning slightly positive but with significant uncertainty.  The lack of Apple-specific information and the general nature of the news (focused on the broader tech sector) suggest a muted impact on AAPL.  The consensus from previous models shows a gradual increase in the probability of a price rise over rounds, indicating a strengthening of positive sentiment.  Considering the positive outlook tempered by uncertainties and the general nature of the news, a conservative estimate is warranted, slightly higher than a coin flip but acknowledging significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally optimistic outlook for the tech sector, including Apple Inc.
