(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

While a 20% earnings growth projection for Big Tech in 2025 is positive, it's a future prediction and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of 'erosion' in PE ratios and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact introduces downside risk.  The article lacks specific information about Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted compared to a news item directly concerning Apple. We should expect the market to react to the overall tech sector sentiment, which is cautiously optimistic.  A slight positive bias is assumed due to the overall positive outlook for the sector, but the uncertainty remains a significant factor.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
