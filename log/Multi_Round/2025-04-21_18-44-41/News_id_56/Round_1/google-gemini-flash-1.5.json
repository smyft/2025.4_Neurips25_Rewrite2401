      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\nNews Content: Revenue grows to $48.4 billion, helping fuel the chief executive\u2019s bets on augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality may have a mixed impact on Apple Inc. While it highlights growth in the tech sector, it also indicates increased competition in areas where Apple is active, such as augmented reality and AI. Investors may react positively to the overall growth in the tech industry but could also be cautious about the competitive landscape. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise due to overall market optimism, but with a significant chance of a fall due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' (META) strong sales growth and increased investment in AI and augmented reality. While this is positive news for Meta, it has an indirect and potentially competitive implication for Apple (AAPL). Meta's success in these areas could intensify competition in the augmented reality and AI spaces, where Apple is also heavily invested. However, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current financial performance or product offerings. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The market might perceive increased competition as a potential future challenge for Apple, but the immediate impact is limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR.  While this is positive news for Meta, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile devices, advertising), but the news doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or competitive landscape in a significant way.  A strong showing by a competitor doesn't automatically translate to negative news for Apple.  The market's reaction might be muted, with a slight possibility of a negative correlation if investors reallocate funds from other tech companies to Meta, but this is unlikely to be a major factor.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of no change or a minor, neutral movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Meta Platforms' record sales and its impact on Mark Zuckerberg's investments in AI and augmented reality. While this news is positive for Meta Platforms (META), it does not directly pertain to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. However, if investors interpret Meta's success in AI as a competitive threat or a positive signal for the broader tech sector, there might be minor indirect effects. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Meta Platforms' positive sales report and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that the news is not directly related to Apple's performance or announcements, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are roughly equal, with a slight bias towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather to Meta Platforms. Since the news is about Meta Platforms' sales growth and its impact on their AI spending, it does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects. However, as both companies are major players in the tech industry, positive news about one company can sometimes have a positive impact on the sector as a whole, due to increased investor confidence in tech stocks. Nonetheless, the effect on Apple would be indirect and likely minimal compared to the direct impact on Meta Platforms. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this specific news is estimated to be relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news is about Meta Platforms and their record sales, which indicates strong performance in areas like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. This might not directly impact Apple Inc. since it is a different company. However, if investors view this news positively, they might shift focus towards the broader technology sector, possibly benefiting Apple as well. Nonetheless, there's no direct positive or negative impact on Apple from Meta's performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
