While this is positive news for Meta, it has an indirect and potentially competitive implication for Apple (AAPL). Meta's success in these areas could intensify competition in the augmented reality and AI spaces, where Apple is also heavily invested. However, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current financial performance or product offerings. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative.
