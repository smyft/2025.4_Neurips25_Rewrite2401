While this is positive news for Meta, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile devices, advertising), but the news doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or competitive landscape in a significant way.  A strong showing by a competitor doesn't automatically translate to negative news for Apple.  The market's reaction might be muted, with a slight possibility of a negative correlation if investors reallocate funds from other tech companies to Meta, but this is unlikely to be a major factor.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of no change or a minor, neutral movement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.1,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```\n"
