      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\nNews Content: Revenue grows to $48.4 billion, helping fuel the chief executive\u2019s bets on augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality may have a mixed impact on Apple Inc. While it highlights growth in the tech sector, it also indicates increased competition in areas where Apple is active, such as augmented reality and AI. Investors may react positively to the overall growth in the tech industry but could also be cautious about the competitive landscape. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise due to overall market optimism, but with a significant chance of a fall due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' (META) strong sales growth and increased investment in AI and augmented reality. While this is positive news for Meta, it has an indirect and potentially competitive implication for Apple (AAPL). Meta's success in these areas could intensify competition in the augmented reality and AI spaces, where Apple is also heavily invested. However, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's current financial performance or product offerings. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The market might perceive increased competition as a potential future challenge for Apple, but the immediate impact is limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR.  While this is positive news for Meta, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile devices, advertising), but the news doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or competitive landscape in a significant way.  A strong showing by a competitor doesn't automatically translate to negative news for Apple.  The market's reaction might be muted, with a slight possibility of a negative correlation if investors reallocate funds from other tech companies to Meta, but this is unlikely to be a major factor.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of no change or a minor, neutral movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Meta Platforms' record sales and its impact on Mark Zuckerberg's investments in AI and augmented reality. While this news is positive for Meta Platforms (META), it does not directly pertain to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. However, if investors interpret Meta's success in AI as a competitive threat or a positive signal for the broader tech sector, there might be minor indirect effects. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Meta Platforms' positive sales report and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending on AI, augmented reality, and other technologies do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that the news is not directly related to Apple's performance or announcements, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are roughly equal, with a slight bias towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather to Meta Platforms. Since the news is about Meta Platforms' sales growth and its impact on their AI spending, it does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects. However, as both companies are major players in the tech industry, positive news about one company can sometimes have a positive impact on the sector as a whole, due to increased investor confidence in tech stocks. Nonetheless, the effect on Apple would be indirect and likely minimal compared to the direct impact on Meta Platforms. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this specific news is estimated to be relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news is about Meta Platforms and their record sales, which indicates strong performance in areas like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. This might not directly impact Apple Inc. since it is a different company. However, if investors view this news positively, they might shift focus towards the broader technology sector, possibly benefiting Apple as well. Nonetheless, there's no direct positive or negative impact on Apple from Meta's performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality suggests strong performance in the tech sector. However, this news primarily pertains to Meta and does not directly impact Apple's financials or operations. While there may be some indirect effects due to increased competition in areas where both companies operate, the overall sentiment in the tech sector could lead to a neutral to slightly positive reaction for Apple. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a rise, but with a significant chance of a fall due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and investment in AI/AR. While this is positive for Meta, it presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, it signals overall strength in the tech sector, which could lift Apple's stock. On the other hand, it intensifies competition in areas like AR/AI where Apple is also heavily invested. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that the impact on Apple is indirect and potentially negative due to increased competition. However, some models also acknowledge a potential positive impact due to overall tech sector optimism. Given the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a slightly negative or neutral impact, I will adjust my prediction accordingly, but still acknowledge the potential for a slight rise due to market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is primarily about Meta's strong performance and increased AI investment.  This has indirect implications for Apple, as both companies compete in AI and AR.  However, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's financials or product offerings.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, from a slight bias towards a price rise to a belief that the impact will be minimal or even slightly negative.  The consensus seems to lean towards a neutral or slightly negative impact, with the possibility of a minor positive impact if investors see this as a positive sign for the broader tech sector. Considering the lack of direct relevance and the divergence in previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a neutral outcome, with slightly higher chances of a price fall due to potential increased competition in the long term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality, which does not directly pertain to Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the news is positive for Meta, its impact on Apple is indirect and likely minimal. The tech sector as a whole might see a slight boost in investor confidence, but the competitive implications for Apple in AI and AR could also be a concern. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed signals from previous predictions, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, with a slight bias towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news provided focuses on Meta Platforms' (META) record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality, which does not directly relate to Apple's (AAPL) financial performance or product announcements. While Meta's success in AI and AR might indirectly influence investor perception across the tech sector, there's no immediate or direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given that Meta's success doesn't directly correlate with Apple's financials or operations, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced but with a slight inclination towards no significant change or a minor positive impact due to overall sector confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality has an indirect impact on Apple Inc. While it highlights growth in the tech sector, it also indicates increased competition in areas where Apple is active. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed view on how this news affects Apple, with some models predicting a slight inclination towards a rise due to overall market optimism and others predicting a neutral to slightly negative impact due to competitive pressures. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business operations, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be roughly equal, with a slight bias towards no significant change.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news is focused on Meta Platforms and their record sales growth, coupled with investments in AI and augmented reality. Although this indicates strong performance in the tech sector, it primarily affects Meta Platforms. The news does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. However, there could be some indirect effects due to the increased competition in areas like AI and augmented reality. The probabilities are influenced by the fact that investors might react positively to the tech sector's growth while being cautious about increased competition for Apple.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality suggests strong performance in the tech sector, which could create a positive sentiment overall. However, it also indicates increased competition in areas where Apple operates, such as augmented reality and AI. While the news does not directly impact Apple's financials, the competitive implications could lead to a cautious market reaction. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a rise due to overall market optimism, but with a significant chance of a fall due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strong performance and investment in AI/AR.

However, some models also acknowledge a potential positive impact due to overall tech sector optimism. Given the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a slightly negative or neutral impact, I will adjust my prediction accordingly, but still acknowledge the potential for a slight rise due to market sentiment. I am slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the previous round, as the market may react positively to the overall tech sector growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is about Meta's strong performance and increased investment in AI and AR.

Some models acknowledge a potential positive impact due to overall tech sector optimism.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the divergence in previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of a price fall due to potential increased competition in the long term. The overall trend in predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, but the magnitude of the change is expected to be small.  The initial predictions were more evenly split, but the second round shows a stronger consensus towards a slightly negative or neutral impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality, which does not directly pertain to Apple Inc.

Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business operations, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be roughly equal, with a slight bias towards no significant change. However, taking into account the trend of previous predictions and the potential for increased competition, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome or a minor negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news is focused on Meta Platforms and their record sales growth, coupled with investments in AI and augmented reality.

While it signals overall strength in the tech sector, potentially lifting Apple's stock due to positive market sentiment, it also intensifies competition in key areas like AR/AI where Apple is heavily invested. The previous rounds of predictions show a general consensus that the impact on Apple is indirect, with varying opinions on whether the net effect is positive, negative, or neutral. There's a slight trend towards a negative impact due to increased competition, but the positive sentiment from overall tech sector growth cannot be ignored. Considering the trend and the mixed signals, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the previous round, but still maintaining a higher probability of a fall due to the competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is about Meta's strong performance and increased investment in AI and AR, which indirectly impacts Apple.  While it suggests overall tech sector strength (potentially positive for Apple), it also highlights increased competition in key areas for Apple.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a slightly negative or neutral impact on Apple's stock price, with probabilities generally leaning towards a higher chance of a fall than a rise.  However, there's no consensus, and the magnitude of any price movement is expected to be small.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the mixed signals, I'm assigning a higher probability to a neutral outcome or a minor negative impact, reflecting the competitive pressure and the overall cautious sentiment from the previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it has indirect implications due to the competitive overlap in AI and AR sectors. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a slight positive impact due to overall tech sector optimism, while others highlight potential negative effects from increased competition. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed signals from previous rounds, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling are both moderate, with a slight bias towards a neutral or minor negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline about Meta Platforms' record sales and increased investment in AI and augmented reality does not directly impact Apple's financials or operations.
