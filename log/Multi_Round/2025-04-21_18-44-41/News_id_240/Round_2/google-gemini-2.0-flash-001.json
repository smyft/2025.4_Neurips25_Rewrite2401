(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could further contribute to negative sentiment. Given these factors, there is a balanced risk of both upward and downward price movement, but the potential for a sell-off may lean slightly towards a price decline. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on the institutional ownership of Apple (AAPL). While high institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign, indicating confidence in the company, the article also points out the potential vulnerability of the stock price to institutional trading decisions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which could be interpreted negatively. The general public ownership is also significant, but not enough to counter institutional decisions. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, highlighting potential risks associated with institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also presents a risk.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article lacks specific details about the volume or timing of these sales, making it difficult to quantify their impact.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both the potential upside and downside risks associated with high institutional ownership.  Given the lack of strongly positive or negative information beyond the inherent risk of concentrated institutional ownership, the probabilities are assigned relatively close to even.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership. Institutional ownership can be a double-edged sword: while it often indicates confidence in the company, large-scale trades by institutions can lead to significant price volatility. The article mentions that 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders, and there have been recent sales by insiders. Insider sales can sometimes signal a lack of confidence, but the article notes that insider ownership is under 1%, which is not unusual for a large company like Apple. The general public owns 37%, which is substantial but not enough to sway major decisions. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong institutional ownership but recent insider sales\u2014the stock price could be influenced by institutional trading decisions, which are hard to predict. However, the overall tone of the article suggests that institutional ownership is generally positive, but the potential for large-scale selling by a few key players introduces downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ownership structure of Apple Inc., highlighting that 61% of the shares are owned by institutional investors. This indicates that the stock price may be vulnerable to the trading decisions of these institutions. However, the fact that institutions have a significant stake in the company can also be seen as a positive trait, as it suggests that they have confidence in the company's prospects. The article also notes that the top 25 shareholders own less than 50% of the shares, which implies that no single individual has a majority interest. Additionally, insiders own less than 1% of the shares, which is not surprising given the company's large size. Overall, the news does not seem to have a significant impact on the stock price, as it is more of an informational article about the company's ownership structure rather than a report of any major events or changes. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact stock price movements. While institutional ownership suggests strong backing and analyst support, insider sales indicate a lack of confidence among insiders. The combined effect of these factors suggests moderate uncertainty in the stock's short-term direction.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional ownership, which can lead to significant price movements based on their trading decisions. While institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, the potential for large sell-offs by these investors poses a risk to the stock price. The mention of recent insider sales adds to the negative sentiment, suggesting a lack of confidence among insiders. Given these factors, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a price fall compared to a rise, but the overall sentiment remains somewhat balanced due to the strong institutional backing.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership, which can be a double-edged sword. While it indicates confidence from large investors, it also makes the stock vulnerable to large sell-offs. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a slight bearish sentiment. Given the mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly increase the probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases vulnerability to their trading decisions.  The mention of recent insider sales adds a negative element, although the low overall insider ownership (under 1%) mitigates this somewhat.  The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall. However, the lack of specific details regarding the volume and timing of insider sales, and the overall positive sentiment generally associated with high institutional ownership, prevents a strong conclusion. Considering the inherent risk associated with concentrated institutional ownership and the slightly negative signal from insider sales, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, but the probabilities remain relatively close.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership. While this can indicate confidence from large investors, it also means the stock price is vulnerable to their trading decisions. The article mentions recent insider sales, which could be a negative signal, but notes that insider ownership is under 1%, which is typical for a large company. The general public owns 37%, which is significant but not enough to counter institutional moves. The overall tone is neutral, acknowledging both the potential upside and downside risks of high institutional ownership. Given the mixed signals and the lack of strongly positive or negative information, the probabilities are assigned relatively close to even, with a slight edge towards a price fall due to the potential for institutional sell-offs.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership. This can be both a positive and negative indicator. On the positive side, high institutional ownership suggests confidence in the company. However, it also means the stock price is vulnerable to large-scale trading decisions by these institutions, which could lead to significant price volatility. Recent insider sales and the fact that no single individual has a majority interest also contribute to the mixed signals. Overall, while there is potential for upward movement, the risks associated with institutional trading decisions and insider sales suggest a slightly higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Apple Inc. is heavily dominated by institutional owners, with 61% ownership.

The article mentions recent insider sales, which could contribute to negative sentiment. However, the overall tone of the article suggests that institutional ownership is generally positive, but the potential for large-scale selling by a few key players introduces downside risk. Considering the mixed signals and the significant institutional ownership, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced, but slightly leaning towards a fall due to the potential risks associated with institutional trading decisions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact stock price movements. While institutional ownership suggests strong backing and analyst support, insider sales indicate a lack of confidence among insiders. The combined effect of these factors suggests moderate uncertainty in the stock's short-term direction. Previous predictions show a slight tilt towards a lower probability of stock price rise, mainly due to the potential for large-scale trades by institutions. Considering all these factors, the overall probability of either a rise or fall in stock price remains closely balanced, but slightly weighted towards a decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
