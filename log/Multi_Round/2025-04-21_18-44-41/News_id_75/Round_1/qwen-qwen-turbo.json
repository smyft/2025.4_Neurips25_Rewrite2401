(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a significant development that could enhance Apple's product offerings and attract more customers, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. This collaboration may also position Apple favorably against competitors like Globalstar, which saw a drop in its stock price following the announcement. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be tempered by the fact that the beta program is currently limited and the full rollout is not yet available. Overall, the news is likely to be perceived positively, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests a positive development for Apple. Partnering with SpaceX/Starlink and T-Mobile to offer satellite connectivity expands the iPhone's capabilities and potentially increases its appeal to consumers, especially in areas with poor cellular coverage. While Apple already has a Globalstar partnership, the Starlink option is presented as more seamless (automatic connection). The fact that T-Mobile is already beta-testing this with iPhones suggests a level of integration and commitment. However, the news also mentions that Globalstar shares fell, indicating a potential negative impact on Apple's existing partnership. The lack of official comment from Apple introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the potential benefits of the Starlink partnership seem to outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase. The fact that the news was 'secretly' worked on and is now being rolled out also suggests a positive surprise for investors. The negative impact on Globalstar is already priced in, and Apple's diversification is a strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news of Apple integrating Starlink satellite technology into iPhones is a positive development, potentially expanding Apple's services and market reach.  However, the impact is likely to be gradual and limited in the short term. The Starlink integration is currently limited to texting in the US, and a full rollout is still some time away.  While this could be a significant long-term positive, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  The Globalstar stock price drop suggests some investors may view this as a potential threat to existing partnerships, but Apple's overall market position and diverse product portfolio mitigate this risk.  Therefore, a small increase in stock price is more likely than a significant one, and a decrease is unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones. This collaboration enhances Apple's product offering by providing an alternative to its existing Globalstar-based satellite service, potentially expanding its market appeal and technological edge. The move is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it demonstrates Apple's commitment to innovation and partnerships with leading tech companies. However, the news also mentions a drop in Globalstar shares, which could indicate some market concern about competition. Overall, the positive aspects of the partnership are likely to outweigh any negative sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones could have mixed effects on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the partnership enhances Apple's satellite communication capabilities, potentially increasing the value proposition of iPhones. On the other hand, this move might cannibalize Apple's existing satellite service provided through Globalstar Inc., which saw its shares fall about 11% in premarket trading. However, given that Apple's service is already established and the Starlink integration is more of an expansion of capabilities rather than a direct replacement, the overall impact is likely to be positive. Additionally, the automatic functionality of Starlink, even when the phone is in a pocket, could be a significant selling point. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's capabilities in satellite communication, providing an alternative to its in-house service and potentially increasing its market share. The fact that T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service and has enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test suggests a strong collaboration. Additionally, the support for Starlink on iPhones could lead to increased sales and revenue for Apple. However, the impact on Globalstar, whose shares fell about 11% in premarket trading, indicates a potential loss of market share for the company. Overall, the news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of Apple collaborating with SpaceX and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink network support on iPhones could be seen as a significant strategic move, potentially enhancing iPhone functionality and competitiveness. This collaboration broadens Apple's satellite communication capabilities, providing an alternative to its existing partnership with Globalstar. While Globalstar's shares fell due to competition, the market reaction to Apple's partnerships can vary. Investors might view this as a positive development due to increased technological capabilities and potential for new revenue streams. However, the limited scope (texting only initially) and the fact that it's still in beta testing could temper immediate enthusiasm.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
