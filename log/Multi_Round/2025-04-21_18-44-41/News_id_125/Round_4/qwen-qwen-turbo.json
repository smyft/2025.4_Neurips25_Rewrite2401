(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

The options market suggests a potential price movement of about 4.6%, but given the negative sentiment and recent analyst downgrades, the probability of a price decline appears higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the overall market sentiment seems positive due to the Dow and S&P 500's positive performance, the article specifically highlights headwinds for Apple, including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about AI adoption. The article also mentions analysts lowering revenue forecasts and potential disappointment in the upcoming earnings guidance. The InvestingPro fair value model suggests the stock is overvalued with potential downside. The options market expects a 4.6% move up or down. Given these factors, the probability of a price decrease is higher than a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL) citing slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about the company's AI adoption.  Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the article highlights a potential downside of -15.5% based on InvestingPro's Fair Value model.  While the article mentions an expected move of 4.6% up or down in the options market, the overall tone and cited concerns heavily favor a price decrease.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), suggesting its strong AI push, revenue growth, and positive analyst revisions point towards a price increase.  The analysis focuses on the week ahead, and the probabilities are based on the information provided in the context of this short-term timeframe.  External factors like overall market conditions and the Fed meeting are not explicitly factored into the probabilities, but implicitly influence the overall sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news which highlights several factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news mentions headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about Apple's slower adoption of AI. Additionally, 11 out of 17 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. The options market implies a possible move of 4.6% in either direction, and shares fell 3.1% after the last earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the financial prospects of Meta Platforms and Apple Inc. Meta Platforms is highlighted as a stock to buy due to its aggressive push into AI, strong revenue and earnings growth, and innovative efforts. On the other hand, Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16. The article also mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. Additionally, Apple's stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights Meta Platforms as a stock to buy due to its strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as its aggressive push into AI. In contrast, Apple is considered a stock to sell due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article also mentions that Apple's guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth. Additionally, the Fair Value models on InvestingPro point to a potential downside of -15.5% for Apple. Based on this analysis, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and the stock is currently trading below recent levels. The implied volatility suggests a significant price movement, but given the negative sentiment and the recent analyst downgrades, the likelihood of a price fall is higher.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about AI adoption. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock is considered overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. The options market indicates a possible price movement of about 4.6%, but the overall sentiment is negative, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is greater than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is strongly bearish on Apple, citing slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, negative analyst revisions, and an overvalued stock price according to InvestingPro's fair value model. The news article reinforces these concerns. While the options market suggests a potential move of 4.6% in either direction, the overwhelming negative sentiment and the fact that the stock is testing its 200-day moving average suggest a higher probability of a price decline. The previous round's predictions consistently favored a price fall, and there's no new information to suggest a change in this outlook. Therefore, I will maintain a high probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook for Apple, citing slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about AI adoption.  Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the InvestingPro fair value model suggests significant overvaluation with a potential downside of -15.5%. While the options market suggests a possible 4.6% move in either direction, the preponderance of negative factors strongly suggests a higher probability of a price decline.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. Considering this consensus and the weight of negative indicators in the news, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  However, the possibility of a positive surprise from the earnings report cannot be entirely discounted, hence the probability of a rise is not zero.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc.

Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be lower than it falling. The consensus from various models indicates a higher likelihood of a price decrease, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 for a fall, and 0.25 to 0.35 for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about the company's AI adoption.

Therefore, I maintain a high probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a strongly bearish outlook for Apple.  Slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, concerns about AI adoption, and negative analyst revisions all point towards a potential decline.  The InvestingPro fair value model suggests significant overvaluation, adding further weight to the bearish sentiment. While the options market suggests a potential 4.6% move in either direction, the overwhelming negative factors and the consensus of previous predictions strongly favor a price decrease.  The fact that the stock is testing its 200-day moving average further supports this view.
