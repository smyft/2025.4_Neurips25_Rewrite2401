(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters\nNews Content: When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.\n\nBuffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, he lays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Street and keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.\n\nBut when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple, AmEx, and Bank of America are large holdings -- but none are Buffett's favorite stock\n\nLogic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nTech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nHowever, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. \"AmEx,\" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an \"indefinite\" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.\n\nYet it's been a long time since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.\n\nBut since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased this stock in 24 out of the last 25 quarters\n\nInterestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.\n\nRather, detailed purchasing activity of this \"favorite stock\" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in is shares of his own company.\n\nHowever, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.\n\nEven though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.\n\nAside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.\n\nFor one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.\n\nThe other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Despite recent share sales, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong market position and capital-return program. The mention of Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire shares suggests a broader confidence in the market, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the recent share sales may create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment from Buffett's endorsement likely outweighs the negative implications of the share sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) stock, not Apple (AAPL). While the article mentions Apple as a significant holding and highlights its capital return program, it also points out that Berkshire has been selling Apple shares. This suggests that while Buffett still sees value in Apple, it's not his top pick. The article's primary focus is on Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway stock, indicating his strong belief in its long-term value. Therefore, the news is more relevant to Berkshire Hathaway than Apple. However, the 'Double Down' advertisement mentions Apple's past performance, which could have a slightly positive, albeit indirect, impact on investor sentiment towards Apple. Given the mixed signals (selling shares vs. past performance mention), the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's consistent buying of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) shares over the past 24 out of 25 quarters.  While the article mentions Apple as a significant holding, the focus is on Buffett's own company's stock as the one he has the utmost confidence in.  The news about Apple's stock sales is presented as potentially contradicting the idea of Apple being Buffett's top pick. Therefore, the news is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly. Any movement in AAPL would likely be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.  The probability of a price rise or fall due to this news is therefore considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) despite some selling activity, emphasizing the company's strong market position, capital-return program, and consistent buybacks. However, it also notes that Buffett has been selling some shares, which could indicate a mixed sentiment. Given Buffett's reputation and the positive aspects of Apple's business, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, but the selling activity might temper enthusiasm slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment strategy and his confidence in certain stocks. Although the article mentions Apple, American Express, and Bank of America as large holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, it suggests that Buffett's favorite stock is actually Berkshire Hathaway itself, given his consistent buying activity over the past 24 out of 25 quarters. This information implies that Buffett has strong confidence in his own company's stock. However, the article does not provide any direct or significant negative information about Apple, American Express, or Bank of America that would cause their stock prices to fall. Given that the news is more about Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway rather than providing new, market-moving information about Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal or neutral. Nonetheless, the mention of Apple as a significant holding and the overall positive tone towards Buffett's investment strategy could slightly positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The 'Double Down' advertisement mentioning Apple's past performance could have a slightly positive impact, but the overall focus is on Buffett's confidence in his own company. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight leaning towards a positive impact, but the selling activity tempers the enthusiasm. Therefore, I'll adjust the probabilities slightly downwards from the initial predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's consistent purchase of Berkshire Hathaway shares, not Apple. While Apple is mentioned as a significant Berkshire holding, the article highlights the sale of Apple shares by Berkshire. This mixed signal, coupled with the primary focus on Berkshire Hathaway, suggests a limited direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning slightly positive due to Buffett's overall positive sentiment towards the market and Apple's strong fundamentals, while others see a neutral or even slightly negative impact due to the share sales. Considering the lack of direct positive news for Apple and the conflicting signals, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the lingering positive association with Buffett's investment choices, but the effect is likely to be muted by the news of Berkshire's share sales.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Warren Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) rather than Apple Inc.
