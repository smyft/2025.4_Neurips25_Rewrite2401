(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market\nNews Content: Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly from DeepSeek, have led to a broader market reaction that could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', which is expected to see a slowdown in earnings growth, the probability of a stock price decline is higher. However, Apple's strong brand and historical resilience may mitigate some of the negative impact, leading to a lower probability of a rise in stock price. Overall, the market's reaction to the news suggests a higher likelihood of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a market sell-off triggered by concerns about increased competition in the AI space, specifically from DeepSeek impacting Nvidia and other big tech companies. While the article focuses on the broader 'Magnificent Seven' and their significant contribution to S&P 500 earnings, it doesn't directly mention Apple's specific exposure to the DeepSeek competition or any immediate negative impact on Apple's business. However, the general market sentiment is negative, and the article suggests a potential slowdown in Big Tech earnings growth, which could indirectly affect Apple. Given Apple's size and influence, a general market downturn often impacts its stock price. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. This suggests that the 'Magnificent Seven' are still expected to grow earnings, but at a slower pace than before. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the overall negative market sentiment and potential for slower growth, but not a drastic fall since Apple's specific situation isn't directly addressed as severely impacted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on a significant sell-off in the market driven by concerns about competition in the AI space, particularly impacting the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, including Apple.  While Apple's direct involvement in the DeepSeek event isn't explicitly mentioned, the article strongly ties Apple's performance to the overall health of the tech sector and the continued strong earnings growth of Big Tech.  A slowdown in this growth, as suggested by the DeepSeek event and the market reaction, would negatively impact Apple's stock price.  The article highlights the significant weight of the 'Magnificent Seven' in the S&P 500, implying that their performance heavily influences the overall market.  Therefore, the negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector and the broader tech market increases the likelihood of a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio might offer some resilience.  The probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but it's not a certainty given Apple's inherent strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in big tech stocks, including Apple Inc., due to concerns over competition in the AI space sparked by developments from DeepSeek. The broader market sentiment is negative as investors question the sustainability of high earnings growth expectations for big tech companies. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and is experiencing pre-market declines similar to its peers (down ~5%), the immediate reaction is likely negative. While Apple's core business is less reliant on AI compared to Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall market pullback in big tech could weigh on its stock in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may provide some resilience. The probability of a fall is higher due to the immediate market reaction, but not extreme given Apple's unique position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of the DeepSeek sell-off on the stock market, particularly on big tech earnings. It highlights that the rapid earnings growth of big tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), has been a driving force behind the bull market. However, the article also mentions that a slowdown in big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market. The launch of DeepSeek's AI model has sparked investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, leading to a sell-off in big tech stocks. Given that Apple is a part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and its earnings growth is expected to slow, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek's AI model launch on the big tech earnings story, which has been a driving force of the bull market. The launch has sparked concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, leading to a sell-off in the markets. However, the article also notes that big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis, with the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter. Given that Apple is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, its earnings growth is likely to be affected by the developments in the AI space. The article suggests that the rapid earnings growth of big tech companies may slow down, which could negatively impact the stock price. However, the expected earnings growth of 21.7% in the fourth quarter and 24% in the third quarter of 2025 could also support the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a sell-off triggered by concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly affecting Nvidia and other big tech companies. While the article suggests that big tech earnings remain a key pillar of the bull market, the immediate reaction is negative for these companies, including Apple. This could indicate a broader market sentiment shift against big tech stocks. However, Apple's diversified portfolio and strong fundamentals might provide some resilience.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The concerns over competition in the AI space, particularly from DeepSeek, have led to a broader market reaction that could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. While Apple's strong brand and historical resilience may mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall market sentiment is negative, and the potential for slower growth in earnings for big tech increases the likelihood of a price fall. Given the context of the news and the previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on a market sell-off driven by AI competition concerns, impacting the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. While Apple's direct AI involvement isn't highlighted, its performance is tied to the tech sector's health. Previous predictions leaned towards a stock price fall, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.8. Given the consistent negative sentiment and the lack of specific positive news for Apple, I'll adjust the probability slightly towards a more moderate fall, acknowledging Apple's inherent strength and brand value. The trend of previous predictions suggests a consensus view of negative impact, but not a catastrophic one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news describes a significant market sell-off driven by concerns about increased AI competition, impacting major tech companies including Apple.  While Apple's direct involvement isn't explicitly detailed, its inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' makes it highly susceptible to the negative market sentiment. The projected slowdown in Big Tech earnings growth, even if still positive, fuels investor apprehension.  The previous predictions range from 0.2 to 0.45 probability of a price rise and 0.55 to 0.8 probability of a price fall.  Considering the overall negative market reaction and the inherent risk associated with the slowdown in Big Tech's earnings growth, a price fall is more likely. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified portfolio might offer some resilience, preventing an extreme drop.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a less severe impact than some of the previous predictions suggest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which includes Apple Inc.

However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may provide some resilience. Given the immediate negative reaction in the market and the high probability of a continued sell-off in big tech stocks, the likelihood of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting major players like Nvidia and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple Inc.

While Apple's direct involvement isn't specified, the negative market sentiment and projected slowdown in Big Tech earnings growth (though still positive) significantly increase the likelihood of a price drop for AAPL.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.8.  However, Apple's strong brand, diversified portfolio, and projected substantial earnings growth in Q4 2024 and Q3 2025 offer some resilience, preventing an extreme drop.
