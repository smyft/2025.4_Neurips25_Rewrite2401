Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially delay production and impact Apple's supply chain, which may lead to concerns among investors about future earnings. As a result, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, given the negative implications of the news on operational efficiency and market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates potential supply chain disruptions for Apple due to Foxconn's difficulties in India. Challenges in deploying staff and importing machinery could delay production and impact Apple's ability to meet demand, especially in a key growth market like India. This negative news is likely to put downward pressure on the stock price. However, the full extent of the impact is unknown without more details, and Apple's overall financial strength and brand loyalty could mitigate some of the negative effects. Therefore, while a price decrease is more likely, a significant drop is not guaranteed.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding its operations in India.  These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the tech sector will likely play a larger role in determining short-term stock price movements than this specific news. Therefore, while there's a small possibility of a negative impact, the overall effect is expected to be muted.  The probability of a price fall is assigned a lower value reflecting this muted impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product availability and increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. However, the extent of the impact depends on how quickly Foxconn can resolve these issues and whether Apple has alternative suppliers or contingency plans in place. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact, the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Foxconn, a key assembly partner of Apple Inc., is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production. Given that Foxconn is crucial to Apple's manufacturing process, any challenges faced by Foxconn could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's production and supply chain, leading to a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the news is not extremely severe, and Apple has diversified its supply chain and manufacturing capabilities. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising, but not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's primary assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt the supply chain for Apple products, leading to production delays and increased costs. Such issues typically raise concerns among investors about the company's ability to meet demand, which can negatively impact stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key assembly partner for Apple, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This situation could lead to potential supply chain disruptions, which may negatively impact Apple's production capabilities and, consequently, its stock price. The consensus among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these operational challenges. However, Apple's strong brand, diversified supply chain, and overall market position may mitigate some of the negative effects. Therefore, while the likelihood of a price drop is significant, it is not overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that the news is negative for Apple due to potential supply chain disruptions caused by Foxconn's challenges in India. Most models predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, one model (google/gemini-flash-1.5) was more optimistic, citing Apple's diversification and the limited scope of the news. Considering the consistent negative sentiment and the potential for production delays, I lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but slightly less extreme than some previous predictions, acknowledging Apple's resilience and diversification efforts. The fact that the news is behind a paywall suggests it might not be widely disseminated, potentially mitigating the impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Foxconn's challenges in India presents a mixed picture. While the potential for supply chain disruptions and production delays is a legitimate concern, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted for several reasons.  Apple's size and diversification across multiple manufacturing partners mitigate the risk associated with any single supplier's issues.  The overall market sentiment towards Apple and the tech sector will likely be a more significant factor in short-term price movements than this specific news.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight majority leaning towards a price fall. However, the reasoning behind the higher probabilities of a price rise (from google/gemini-flash-1.5) highlights the mitigating factors. Considering this, and the lack of detail in the premium article, a moderate probability of a price fall is assigned, acknowledging the potential for limited impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key assembly partner for Apple, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, potentially leading to delays and increased costs.

While Apple may have contingency plans or alternative suppliers, the immediate uncertainty and potential for negative impact suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Previous predictions also predominantly favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 0.7 probability of a fall and 0.3 of a rise. One outlier (google/gemini-flash-1.5) suggested a muted impact, but the consensus leans toward a negative short-term reaction. Therefore, I align with the majority view, assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key assembly partner for Apple, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product availability and increased costs.
