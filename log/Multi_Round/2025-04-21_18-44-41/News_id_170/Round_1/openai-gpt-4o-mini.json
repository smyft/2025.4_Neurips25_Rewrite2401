(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games kicks off plan to add third-party games to own mobile store\nNews Content: (Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.\n\nThe videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.\n\nEpic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.\n\nIt will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as \"Bloons TD 6\" and \"Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee\".\n\nThe company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.\n\n\"We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,\" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.\n\nThe company also offers a computer graphics software, called \"Unreal Engine\", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.\n\nApple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.\n\nAfter getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's \"Fortnite\" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.\n\n($1 = 0.9598 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a mobile store with third-party games could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, it highlights competition in the app marketplace, which could pressure Apple's App Store revenue model. However, the impact may be limited as Epic's store is still in its early stages and has not yet reached its user targets. Additionally, Apple's strong brand and ecosystem may mitigate any immediate negative effects. Therefore, while there is a potential for a slight decline in stock price due to increased competition, the overall impact may not be significant enough to warrant a high probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile game store to include third-party games on both Android and iOS (in the EU). This is a direct challenge to Apple's App Store, which has historically enjoyed a dominant position and high commission rates. While Apple has approved Epic's marketplace in the EU, the increased competition could potentially erode Apple's App Store revenue, especially in the long term. However, the impact is likely to be limited initially, as the expansion is gradual and focused on the EU for iOS. Furthermore, Epic's mobile store user base is currently significantly smaller than Apple's. The return of Fortnite to iPhones in the EU is a positive development for Epic, but its impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. Overall, the news presents a slight negative sentiment for Apple, but the immediate impact is unlikely to be substantial. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally, while temporarily subsidizing Apple's fees for participating developers, is likely to have a minimal impact on Apple's stock price.  While Epic's actions represent increased competition in the mobile app store market, the scale of this impact is limited. Epic's mobile store user base is significantly smaller than Apple's App Store, and the focus is primarily on the EU.  Apple's App Store revenue is substantial and diversified across many app categories, making the impact of a few additional third-party games relatively small.  The news that Fortnite returned to iPhones in the EU is positive for Epic but doesn't directly translate to a negative impact on Apple.  The temporary fee subsidy by Epic is a short-term strategy and unlikely to significantly alter Apple's long-term revenue streams. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' initiative to add third-party games to its own mobile store, which could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from App Store commissions. This development is part of a broader trend where companies like Epic Games are challenging Apple's dominance and fees in the app marketplace. Given that Apple generates significant revenue from its App Store, any move that could disrupt this revenue stream, even marginally, might negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the impact might be limited as Epic Games' mobile store currently has a much smaller user base compared to Apple's App Store, and the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could be seen as a threat to Apple's business model. However, it's worth noting that this development is limited to the European Union and involves a relatively small number of games initially. Apple's overall market dominance and ecosystem are unlikely to be significantly impacted in the short term. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, as the news does not present a substantial immediate threat to the company's core business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile game store to include third-party games, which could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited, as the App Store is just one part of Apple's overall business. Additionally, Apple has already approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe, which suggests that the company is taking steps to address concerns around app store fees and competition. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple, but the impact is likely to be small.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its presence in the mobile gaming market by adding third-party games to its mobile store, which could pose a competitive threat to established marketplaces like Apple's App Store. While this move may encourage competition and reduce Apple's revenue from commissions, the impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal given that Apple's business model is diversified beyond just app store revenues. Additionally, Apple continues to approve Epic's marketplace app in Europe, suggesting a cooperative stance that may mitigate negative impacts.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
