      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\nNews Content: 2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that analysts predict will drop significantly in value. While this news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it may create a negative sentiment around the tech sector, particularly in AI-related stocks. If investors are concerned about the performance of AI stocks, they may also reassess their positions in other tech stocks, including Apple. However, Apple has a strong brand and diverse product offerings, which may mitigate the impact of this news. Therefore, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced, with a slight inclination towards a fall due to potential sector-wide concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for 'popular AI stocks' with potential drops in 2025, according to some Wall Street analysts. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple. The impact on Apple's stock depends on whether investors perceive Apple as one of the 'popular AI stocks' mentioned and how much weight they give to these specific analysts' predictions. Given the vagueness of the headline and the fact that Apple's business is much broader than just AI, the impact is likely to be moderate. However, negative sentiment in the AI sector could still negatively impact Apple's stock price. I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple is a large, diversified company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks predicted to drop significantly in 2025 by some Wall Street analysts.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned stocks. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other factors such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, product releases, etc.  We assume a neutral probability distribution based on the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that certain Wall Street analysts are predicting significant drops (24% and 66%) for two popular AI stocks in 2025, though it does not explicitly name Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, given Apple's involvement in AI technologies, the negative sentiment around AI stocks could indirectly affect AAPL. The lack of specific mention of Apple in the headline reduces the direct impact, but the broader negative sentiment in the AI sector might lead to cautious investor behavior. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly elevated, while the probability of a rise is slightly diminished.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks to sell before they drop 24% and 66% in 2025, according to certain Wall Street analysts. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks to sell. Given that the news does not directly target Apple Inc., the impact on its stock price is likely to be minimal. However, since the news is about potential drops in AI-related stocks and Apple is a major player in AI technology through its products and services, there's a cautious sentiment that might affect investor perception. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are close to neutral due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that certain Wall Street analysts predict a significant drop in the stock prices of two popular AI stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with one predicted to drop by 24% and the other by 66% in 2025. This negative prediction is likely to impact investor sentiment and confidence in the company, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, it's essential to consider that analyst predictions are not always accurate and may not reflect the company's actual performance. Additionally, Apple's strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and loyal customer base could mitigate the potential negative impact of the prediction. Nevertheless, given the negative tone of the news, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two popular AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The content suggests that certain analysts predict these AI stocks will drop significantly by 2025. However, since the news does not directly affect Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price moving based on this news is minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
