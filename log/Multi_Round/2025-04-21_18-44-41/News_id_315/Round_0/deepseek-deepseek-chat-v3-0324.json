(AAPL). However, given Apple's involvement in AI technologies, the negative sentiment around AI stocks could indirectly affect AAPL. The lack of specific mention of Apple in the headline reduces the direct impact, but the broader negative sentiment in the AI sector might lead to cautious investor behavior. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly elevated, while the probability of a rise is slightly diminished.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
