(AAPL), with one predicted to drop by 24% and the other by 66% in 2025. This negative prediction is likely to impact investor sentiment and confidence in the company, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, it's essential to consider that analyst predictions are not always accurate and may not reflect the company's actual performance. Additionally, Apple's strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and loyal customer base could mitigate the potential negative impact of the prediction. Nevertheless, given the negative tone of the news, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
