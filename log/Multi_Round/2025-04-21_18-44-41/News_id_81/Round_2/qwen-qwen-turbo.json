      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared on the back of this non-tech-based investment.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant $725 billion investment by Apple that is contributing to its growth, specifically noting that this growth is not related to AI. A soaring EPS suggests strong financial performance, which typically leads to positive investor sentiment and can drive stock prices up. Given the scale of the investment and its positive impact on earnings, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the absence of AI-related growth could be seen as a missed opportunity, which might temper some investor enthusiasm. Overall, the positive earnings news outweighs potential concerns, leading to a higher probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive development for Apple, highlighting a significant $725 billion investment that is fueling growth and increasing earnings per share (EPS). The fact that this growth is *not* AI-related could be interpreted in a few ways. Some investors might see it as a positive diversification of revenue streams, making Apple less reliant on a single, potentially volatile sector. Others might be concerned that Apple is missing out on the AI boom. However, the explicit mention of soaring EPS suggests a strong positive impact. Given the positive tone and the direct link to increased EPS, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall. However, the lack of specific details about the investment and the potential concern about missing the AI boom temper the probability somewhat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline highlights a significant, non-AI-related investment by Apple that has driven a surge in EPS.  This suggests strong underlying financial health and growth unrelated to the currently volatile AI sector.  While the specific nature of the investment isn't detailed, the positive impact on EPS is a strong bullish signal.  However, the market's reaction will depend on several factors including the overall market sentiment, investor expectations, and any further details revealed about the investment.  Therefore, a high probability of a price rise is predicted, but not a certainty due to external market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is reportedly fueling its growth and has led to a rise in earnings per share (EPS). The mention that this investment is unrelated to AI suggests diversification and strength in other areas, which could be perceived positively by investors. A rising EPS generally indicates strong financial performance, which is likely to be viewed favorably by the market. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's $725 billion investment is driving growth and has positively impacted its earnings per share (EPS). This indicates a positive development for the company, which is likely to have a favorable effect on its stock price. Given that the investment is described as non-tech-based and is contributing to the company's growth, it implies a diversification of revenue streams or a successful strategic move. Such news typically leads to increased investor confidence, which can drive up the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a substantial $725 billion investment by Apple that is driving growth and has led to a significant increase in earnings per share (EPS). This suggests strong financial performance and positive investor sentiment. The fact that the growth is not related to AI could be seen as a diversification strategy, which may reduce reliance on a volatile sector. While some investors might be concerned about missing out on AI opportunities, the overall positive impact on EPS and the scale of the investment indicate a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The consistent positive sentiment from previous rounds, highlighting the significant $725 billion investment and its positive impact on Apple's EPS, suggests a strong likelihood of a stock price increase. The fact that the investment is not AI-related could be seen as a diversification strategy, further bolstering investor confidence. The consensus leans heavily towards a positive stock movement. Given this, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties of the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive.  Apple's massive $725 billion investment, unrelated to the currently volatile AI sector, is driving EPS growth. This suggests strong underlying financial health and diversification. While the lack of AI involvement might be a minor concern for some, the soaring EPS is a significant bullish signal.  The previous predictions largely agree on a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.65 to 0.8.  Considering the consensus and the strong positive news, I'm adjusting the probability slightly higher than the average of previous predictions to account for the significant positive impact of soaring EPS.  However, external market factors and unforeseen circumstances could still influence the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and has led to a surge in earnings per share (EPS), despite being unrelated to AI. This suggests strong financial performance and diversification, which are generally positive signals for investors. The majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.65 to 0.8. The absence of AI-related growth might temper some enthusiasm, but the overall positive impact on EPS and the scale of the investment likely outweigh this concern. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment that is driving growth and has led to a surge in earnings per share (EPS). The fact that this growth is not related to AI suggests a positive diversification of revenue streams or a successful strategic move in other areas. Such a large investment contributing to growth typically leads to increased investor confidence and can drive up the stock price. Given the positive impact on EPS and the overall favorable tone of the news, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, external market forces and investor perceptions about the company's strategy could influence the actual outcome.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is reportedly fueling its growth and has led to a rise in earnings per share (EPS). The mention that this investment is unrelated to AI suggests diversification and strength in other areas, which could be perceived positively by investors. A rising EPS generally indicates strong financial performance, which is likely to be viewed favorably by the market. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price increase. The absence of AI-related growth could be seen as a missed opportunity, but the positive impact on EPS and the diversification of revenue streams are likely to outweigh this concern. Therefore, based on the news and the trend of previous predictions, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a significant $725 billion investment by Apple that has contributed to its growth, with a notable increase in earnings per share (EPS). The non-tech-based nature of this investment shows Apple's diversified approach, which can be seen as a strategic advantage. While some might miss the AI-related advancement, the strong financial performance indicators suggest a positive outlook. Previous predictions from various models indicate a high likelihood of a stock price rise, with most models predicting a probability between 0.7 and 0.8.
