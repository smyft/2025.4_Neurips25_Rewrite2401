(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade to an underperform rating by Jefferies, along with concerns about weak iPhone shipments and the lack of consumer interest in AI features, suggests a bearish outlook for Apple. The potential for missed revenue estimates and disappointing guidance further supports the likelihood of a stock price decline. While Apple has a strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the immediate negative sentiment from the downgrade and the challenges in the smartphone market, particularly in China, outweigh these positives. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. The rare 'underperform' rating from Jefferies is a significant negative signal, especially given the analyst's concerns about weak iPhone shipments, lack of AI resonance, and potential revenue and guidance misses. The price target of $200.75 also suggests downside. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, which continues to grow and contribute significantly to earnings. The potential loss of revenue from the Alphabet antitrust case is a long-term risk, but not an immediate threat. The multiple expansion of the stock suggests it may be overvalued. The negative sentiment surrounding AI features and challenges in the Chinese market further weigh on the stock. Considering these factors, the negative aspects seem to outweigh the positives in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and underwhelming AI features, suggests a potential price drop, several counterpoints exist. Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, provides a buffer against solely focusing on device sales.  The concern about AI features not resonating with consumers is significant, especially considering the lack of AI integration in China, a key market. However, the article also highlights the potential for years-long legal battles to impact Apple's revenue from Alphabet, mitigating the immediate impact. The article's mention of past multiple expansions and the current high P/E ratio suggests the stock might be overvalued, increasing the likelihood of a correction.  Considering these factors, a price drop seems more probable in the short term due to the negative analyst rating and concerns about iPhone sales, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong due to the robust services segment. The probability estimates reflect this balanced perspective, leaning slightly towards a price fall in the near term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer interest in AI features, which could lead to missed revenue estimates and disappointing Q1 guidance. Additionally, Apple faces challenges in China with declining iPhone sales and regulatory hurdles for its AI features. The potential loss of Alphabet's $20 billion annual payment due to antitrust issues adds further risk. Despite strong services revenue growth and high margins, the stock's elevated P/E ratio and diminishing prospects for an iPhone upgrade cycle suggest downside risk. The negative sentiment from a rare downgrade is likely to weigh on investor confidence in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, Jefferies, due to weak iPhone shipment expectations and concerns that Apple's AI features are not resonating with consumers. The analyst downgraded Apple to underperform and set a price target of $200.75. Despite a strong business model, particularly in services revenue which grew 13% last fiscal year, the downgrade and weak iPhone shipment expectations are likely to negatively impact the stock price. Additionally, Apple's struggles in China and potential risks related to the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article reports a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, citing weak iPhone shipments and a lack of resonance with consumers regarding Apple's AI features. Additionally, the analyst expects Apple to miss current revenue estimates and potentially disappoint with its Q1 guidance. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, which has been growing steadily. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the negative analyst rating and potential revenue misses, but the strong business model and high-margin services revenue provide a cushion, preventing a very high probability of a significant fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing concerns over iPhone shipments and AI features. Despite Apple's strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses present significant near-term risks. The market typically reacts negatively to such analyst downgrades.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade to an underperform rating by Jefferies, along with concerns about weak iPhone shipments and the lack of consumer interest in AI features, suggests a bearish outlook for Apple. The potential for missed revenue estimates and disappointing guidance further supports the likelihood of a stock price decline. While Apple has a strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the immediate negative sentiment from the downgrade and the challenges in the smartphone market, particularly in China, outweigh these positives. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to the rare 'underperform' rating from Jefferies. This rating highlights concerns about weak iPhone shipments, lack of consumer interest in AI features, and potential revenue misses. While Apple's strong services revenue provides some support, the negative sentiment from the downgrade and challenges in China outweigh these positives in the short term. The consistency in predictions across different models reinforces the bearish outlook. Given this, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect the strong consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple in the short term, primarily due to the rare underperform rating from Jefferies.  This rating, coupled with concerns about weak iPhone sales, lackluster consumer response to AI features, and potential revenue misses, significantly outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's strong services business. While Apple's services revenue is a significant strength and provides a buffer against potential weakness in hardware sales, the immediate negative sentiment from the downgrade and the challenges in the Chinese market are likely to dominate market reaction in the short term.  The previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.65 to 0.7.  Considering the confluence of negative factors and the consensus of previous models, a similar probability of a price fall is warranted. The long-term prospects remain strong due to the services segment, but the short-term impact of the negative news is likely to be more pronounced.  The high P/E ratio also suggests the stock might be overvalued, increasing the likelihood of a correction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Jefferies' rare underperform rating, citing weak iPhone shipments and lack of consumer interest in AI features, suggests potential revenue misses and disappointing guidance. Challenges in China, including declining iPhone sales and regulatory hurdles for AI, further weigh on the stock. The potential loss of Alphabet's $20 billion annual payment due to antitrust issues adds long-term risk. On the positive side, Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, provides some cushion. However, the stock's elevated P/E ratio and diminishing prospects for an iPhone upgrade cycle suggest downside risk. The negative sentiment from the downgrade is likely to dominate in the short term, outweighing the positives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple's stock price due to the rare underperform rating from Jefferies, weak iPhone shipment expectations, and lackluster consumer interest in AI features. Despite a strong business model and high-margin services revenue, the downgrade and potential revenue misses pose significant near-term risks. The analyst's price target of $200.75 and concerns about Apple's performance in China further weigh on the stock. However, the long-term prospects remain relatively strong due to the robust services segment.

The previous predictions from other models also indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75.
