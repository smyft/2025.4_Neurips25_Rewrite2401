Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being posed implies there could be significant news or an event that investors should be aware of, which might lead to increased volatility. Given the lack of negative or positive indicators in the headline, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the potential for the news to be neutral or slightly positive, as Apple is generally a stable company with a strong market presence. Thus, a slight edge is given to the probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive news or investor optimism leading up to the event.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
