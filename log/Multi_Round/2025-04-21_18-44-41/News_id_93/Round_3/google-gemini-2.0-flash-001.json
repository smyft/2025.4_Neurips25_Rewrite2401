(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Where the UK\u2019s ISA millionaires are investing\nNews Content: The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a trend of increasing investment among ISA millionaires, with a focus on blue-chip companies and diversified portfolios. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, the overall sentiment from the news is more about the general investment behavior of ISA millionaires rather than specific news about Apple itself. Given that ISA millionaires tend to invest for the long term and favor stable, dividend-paying stocks, this could indicate a positive outlook for AAPL. However, without specific catalysts or negative news directly affecting Apple, the probabilities of significant movement are moderate. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive investment sentiment but also acknowledge the potential for a fall due to market volatility or external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on investment trends among UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for blue-chip stocks and diversified funds. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which is a popular fund among these investors, the article doesn't directly provide strong positive or negative signals for Apple's stock. The general trend of ISA millionaires investing in technology funds suggests a positive sentiment towards technology stocks, but this is a weak signal. The article does not contain any specific negative information about Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Given the indirect nature of the information, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) is relatively low. The mention of Apple within a popular fund suggests a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but the effect is expected to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment strategies of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their holdings in various stocks and funds.  While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, a fund popular with this group, the news itself doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's performance or prospects. The article's focus is on the broader investment trends of high-net-worth individuals in the UK, not on specific company news that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement due to this news is considered low.  Any price movement would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment trends of UK ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including popular funds like the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has Apple (AAPL) as one of its top holdings. The article does not provide any direct negative or positive news about Apple Inc. itself, but the inclusion of AAPL in a top-performing fund suggests continued investor confidence. However, since the news is more about general investment trends rather than specific company performance, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the indirect positive sentiment from being part of a high-performing fund.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of ISA millionaires on the Hargreaves Lansdown platform, specifically highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the top holdings in the Legal & Global Global Technology Index Trust, which is popular among these investors. The article also mentions that the fund has delivered a strong performance, with a 38% increase over the past year. This suggests that investors have confidence in the company's long-term prospects. However, there is no direct news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) itself in the article. The popularity of the fund that includes Apple as a top holding, and the overall positive sentiment towards technology stocks, could have a mildly positive impact on the stock price. But, given that the news is not directly about Apple, the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment habits of 'ISA millionaires' in the UK, highlighting their preference for established, dividend-paying companies. Although Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the holdings in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has seen a significant increase, the article does not directly focus on Apple's performance or provide new information that would significantly impact its stock price. Given that the article does not contain specific positive or negative news about Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced, but slightly leaning towards a neutral or slight positive impact due to the indirect mention of Apple within a successful fund.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the investment behavior of ISA millionaires, who tend to invest in stable, dividend-paying companies like Legal & General and BP. Although these companies have recently faced challenges, they continue to pay dividends and maintain a strategy of returning capital to investors. For Apple Inc., the news mentions it as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, indicating strong investor confidence in the technology sector. However, specific news affecting Apple is not mentioned directly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news discusses the investment trends of ISA millionaires, highlighting their preference for blue-chip stocks and diversified portfolios. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in a popular technology fund, which suggests a positive sentiment towards the stock. However, the article does not provide specific news or catalysts directly affecting Apple, leading to a more neutral outlook. The overall trend of increasing investment among ISA millionaires indicates a stable interest in established companies, which could positively influence AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging the potential for a fall due to market volatility or external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment trends of UK ISA millionaires, noting their preference for blue-chip stocks and diversified funds. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, a fund popular among these investors. While this is a positive signal, the article doesn't provide any specific news directly impacting Apple's performance. The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent sentiment of slightly positive to neutral impact on Apple's stock price. Considering this, I'll adjust the probabilities slightly upwards, reflecting the continued positive sentiment and the indirect positive signal from being included in a popular fund.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the investment strategies of wealthy UK investors, mentioning Apple (AAPL) only indirectly as a holding in a high-performing technology fund.  The article doesn't provide any specific news about Apple's performance or prospects. While the fund's success might suggest some positive sentiment towards technology stocks, including AAPL, this is a weak signal.  The overall impact on AAPL's stock price from this news is likely to be minimal.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly centered around 0.5, reflecting the lack of direct Apple-specific information. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the consensus of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the positive performance of the fund holding AAPL, but the effect is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the investment trends of UK ISA millionaires, with a focus on their preference for diversified and balanced portfolios, including popular funds like the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has Apple (AAPL) as one of its top holdings.

However, the article does not provide direct information about Apple's performance or prospects.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a top holding in the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust, which has performed well. While the article does not provide specific news about Apple, the overall sentiment from the ISA millionaires' preference for stable, well-performing technology funds could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited, as the article does not provide direct catalysts or negative news about the company.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights the investment trends of UK ISA millionaires, who are increasingly investing in blue-chip stocks and diversified portfolios.

However, the article does not provide specific news or catalysts directly affecting Apple, leading to a more neutral outlook.
