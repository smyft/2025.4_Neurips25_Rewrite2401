A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity markets ended higher, which generally reflects positive sentiment among investors. The inauguration of President Trump may lead to expectations of pro-business policies, potentially benefiting large corporations like Apple Inc. Given this context, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising as investors may react positively to the overall market trend and potential policy changes. However, there is always a risk of volatility and market corrections, which is why the probability of a price fall is not negligible.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher on Tuesday as Trump took office. This suggests a positive market sentiment overall. While the headline doesn't specifically mention Apple, a generally positive market environment often benefits large-cap companies like Apple. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or any sector-specific impacts makes it difficult to assign a very high probability to a price rise. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall further limits the analysis. Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline states that US equities markets ended higher on the day Trump took office.  This is a general market trend and doesn't offer specific information about Apple.  While a positive market day might correlate with a positive movement in Apple's stock price, the connection is weak without more specific information about Apple's performance or any Trump administration policies that might directly impact the company.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is largely based on pre-existing market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in this news snippet.  A neutral stance is assumed, with slightly higher probability assigned to a rise due to the overall market positivity mentioned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher as President Donald Trump takes office. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major component of these indexes, is likely to benefit from the overall market optimism. Given the broad market uptick, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including benchmark equity indexes, ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. While the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or its stock performance, it suggests a positive overall market trend. Given that Apple's stock is a significant component of major US equity indexes, it is likely that AAPL's stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on Tuesday as markets reacted to President Donald Trump's initial actions. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which could have a favorable impact on major technology stocks like Apple Inc. Historically, Apple's stock has been sensitive to broader market trends and political developments. Given the positive market close, it is reasonable to assume that Apple's stock might also be positively affected, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day when President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including Apple Inc. However, the news does not specifically mention Apple or any factors directly affecting the company's performance. Therefore, while the overall market trend is positive, the specific impact on Apple's stock price cannot be definitively determined from this information alone.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
