A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity markets ended higher, which generally reflects positive sentiment among investors. The inauguration of President Trump may lead to expectations of pro-business policies, potentially benefiting large corporations like Apple Inc. Given this context, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising as investors may react positively to the overall market trend and potential policy changes. However, there is always a risk of volatility and market corrections, which is why the probability of a price fall is not negligible.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher on Tuesday as Trump took office. This suggests a positive market sentiment overall. While the headline doesn't specifically mention Apple, a generally positive market environment often benefits large-cap companies like Apple. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or any sector-specific impacts makes it difficult to assign a very high probability to a price rise. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall further limits the analysis. Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline states that US equities markets ended higher on the day Trump took office.  This is a general market trend and doesn't offer specific information about Apple.  While a positive market day might correlate with a positive movement in Apple's stock price, the connection is weak without more specific information about Apple's performance or any Trump administration policies that might directly impact the company.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is largely based on pre-existing market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in this news snippet.  A neutral stance is assumed, with slightly higher probability assigned to a rise due to the overall market positivity mentioned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher as President Donald Trump takes office. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major component of these indexes, is likely to benefit from the overall market optimism. Given the broad market uptick, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including benchmark equity indexes, ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. While the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or its stock performance, it suggests a positive overall market trend. Given that Apple's stock is a significant component of major US equity indexes, it is likely that AAPL's stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article mentions that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on Tuesday as markets reacted to President Donald Trump's initial actions. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which could have a favorable impact on major technology stocks like Apple Inc. Historically, Apple's stock has been sensitive to broader market trends and political developments. Given the positive market close, it is reasonable to assume that Apple's stock might also be positively affected, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day when President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including Apple Inc. However, the news does not specifically mention Apple or any factors directly affecting the company's performance. Therefore, while the overall market trend is positive, the specific impact on Apple's stock price cannot be definitively determined from this information alone.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity markets ended higher on the day President Trump took office, suggesting a positive market sentiment. As Apple Inc. is a major component of these indexes, it is likely to benefit from the overall market optimism. While the news does not provide specific information about Apple's performance, the general trend in the market is favorable for large-cap companies like Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising compared to falling, reflecting the positive sentiment in the broader market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that the news of US equity markets ending higher on Trump's inauguration day is a generally positive signal for Apple (AAPL). While the news doesn't directly mention Apple, the positive market sentiment is likely to have a positive impact on a large-cap company like Apple. The previous predictions ranged from 0.55 to 0.7 for a price rise. Considering this and the lack of any specific negative information about Apple, I will slightly increase the probability of a price rise, but not too drastically, as the news is quite general and the full article is unavailable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive overall market trend on the day of President Trump's inauguration.  While the article lacks specifics about Apple, the general market positivity suggests a likely positive correlation for Apple's stock price.  However, the lack of detail and the paywalled nature of the full article limit the certainty of this correlation.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise, and the general positive market sentiment, a probability slightly above the average of previous predictions is assigned to a price rise.  The probability of a price fall is the complement of the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive sentiment in the US equity markets following President Trump's inauguration, which could benefit large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is a significant component of major US equity indexes, the overall market uptick is likely to positively influence its stock price. While the news does not provide specific details about Apple, the general market trend suggests a higher probability of a price rise. However, the absence of company-specific factors introduces some uncertainty, warranting a moderate probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive overall market sentiment, which often benefits large-cap companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the headline does not specifically mention Apple or any factors directly affecting the company's performance, the general market trend is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the information provided and the consensus among various predictions, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. However, the effect is likely to be moderate due to the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or any sector-specific impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher as President Donald Trump takes office. This suggests a favorable overall market trend, which could positively impact major technology stocks like Apple Inc. Given the broad market uptick and the fact that Apple's stock is a significant component of major US equity indexes, it is likely that AAPL's stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. However, the lack of specific information about Apple's performance or any Trump administration policies that might directly impact the company introduces some uncertainty. Considering the predictions from other models, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, and taking into account the potential for market volatility and the limited information provided, a balanced estimate is warranted.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day when President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including Apple Inc. However, the news does not specifically mention Apple or any factors directly affecting the company's performance. The majority of previous predictions suggest a slight bias towards a rising stock price, but with varying degrees of confidence. Considering the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's significant presence in major indexes, it is reasonable to assign a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity markets ended higher on the day President Trump took office, suggesting a positive market sentiment.

Previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, ranging from 0.55 to 0.72. Given this consensus and the lack of any specific negative information about Apple, I will slightly increase the probability of a price rise, but not too drastically, as the news is quite general and the full article is unavailable. I will also consider the trend of the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive overall market trend on the day of President Trump's inauguration.  This positive market sentiment is likely to have a positive correlation with Apple's stock price, given that Apple is a major component of US equity indexes. However, the lack of specific details about Apple in the news and the paywalled nature of the full article limit the certainty of this correlation.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (averaging around 0.63 for a rise), but with a range reflecting uncertainty.  Considering the general positive market trend and the consensus of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty due to the limited information provided.  The probability of a price fall is the complement of the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher as President Donald Trump takes office.

However, the effect is likely to be moderate due to the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or any sector-specific impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.64, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.36, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive overall market trend on the day of President Trump's inauguration, which could benefit large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is a significant component of major US equity indexes, the overall market uptick is likely to positively influence its stock price.

As Apple Inc. is a major component of these indexes, it is likely to benefit from the overall market optimism. While the news does not provide specific information about Apple's performance, the general trend in the market is favorable for large-cap companies like Apple. Previous predictions from various models consistently lean towards a higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the positive sentiment in the broader market. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.74, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.26, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity markets ending higher on the day President Trump took office.

This positive market sentiment is likely to correlate positively with Apple's stock price, given its position as a major component of US equity indexes. However, the lack of specific details about Apple in the news and the paywalled nature of the full article limit the certainty of this correlation.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, converging around 0.65.  Considering the general positive market trend, the consensus of previous predictions, and the inherent uncertainty due to limited information, I'm assigning a probability slightly above the average of previous predictions to a price rise. The probability of a price fall is the complement of the probability of a price rise.  The slight increase in probability of a rise in later rounds reflects the strengthening consensus among the models, but the lack of specific information about Apple keeps the probability from being significantly higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US benchmark equity indexes ending higher as President Donald Trump takes office.
