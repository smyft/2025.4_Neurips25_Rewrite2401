While the headline doesn't specifically mention Apple, a generally positive market environment often benefits large-cap companies like Apple. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or any sector-specific impacts makes it difficult to assign a very high probability to a price rise. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall further limits the analysis. Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
