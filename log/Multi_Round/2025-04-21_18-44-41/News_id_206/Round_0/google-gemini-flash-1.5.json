This is a general market trend and doesn't offer specific information about Apple.  While a positive market day might correlate with a positive movement in Apple's stock price, the connection is weak without more specific information about Apple's performance or any Trump administration policies that might directly impact the company.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is largely based on pre-existing market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in this news snippet.  A neutral stance is assumed, with slightly higher probability assigned to a rise due to the overall market positivity mentioned.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
