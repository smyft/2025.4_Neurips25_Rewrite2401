(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already set low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade, removal of price target, and lowered revenue/EPS forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and the lack of compelling AI applications further exacerbate the negative sentiment. The cited data from Canalys showing significant declines in iPhone shipments to China reinforces these concerns. While the article mentions upcoming Q1 earnings, the overall tone suggests that these earnings may not be strong enough to offset the negative factors. The fact that the stock dipped in morning trading after the news broke is also indicative of negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative.  Oppenheimer, a reputable firm, downgraded Apple's stock and lowered its price target due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The cited 25% drop in Q4 iPhone shipments to China is significant.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a counter-narrative, the pre-earnings downgrade and lowered revenue/EPS forecasts significantly increase the likelihood of a negative market reaction. The mention of increased competition and a lack of compelling AI applications further fuels the bearish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although a positive earnings surprise could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing slower iPhone sales, market share losses in China, and increased competition. The firm also reduced its revenue and EPS forecasts, which are negative signals for investors. Additionally, the article mentions declining iPhone shipments in China and a slower replacement cycle, further dampening growth prospects. Given these factors, the market sentiment is likely to be bearish in the short term, especially ahead of the earnings release. However, the actual stock movement will also depend on the earnings results and any forward guidance provided by Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The downgrade from Outperform to Perform, along with the removal of a $250 price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, presents a negative outlook. Additionally, the mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth further supports a negative sentiment. Given that the article mentions Apple shares dipped after the downgrade, it suggests an immediate negative impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. Additionally, iPhone shipments to China declined significantly in Q4 and for all of 2024. Given this negative news, it is likely that the stock price will fall. However, the article also mentions that the stock was only down a fraction in morning trading, suggesting that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China are significant negative factors. The removal of the price target and reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts further indicate a pessimistic outlook. These factors outweigh any short-term market reaction or upcoming earnings. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of continued downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, along with the removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, indicates a significant bearish sentiment surrounding Apple's growth prospects. The concerns over slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and increased competition further exacerbate this negative outlook. The reported decline in iPhone shipments to China and the expectation of a slower replacement cycle add to the uncertainty. Although the upcoming earnings report could provide some counter-narrative, the overall tone of the news suggests that the market is likely to react negatively. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is considerably higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is overwhelmingly bearish, driven by Oppenheimer's downgrade, concerns about iPhone sales in China, and lowered financial forecasts. The consistent prediction of a higher probability of a stock price fall reflects the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. While earnings could offer a surprise, the pre-earnings downgrade and negative data points make a positive outcome less likely. Given the trend of negative predictions and the lack of any counterbalancing positive information, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The overwhelming consensus among the previous models is that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.  The downgrade by Oppenheimer, a reputable firm, coupled with the reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, and the concerning decline in iPhone sales in China, paints a bearish picture. While the upcoming earnings report could potentially offer a positive surprise, the pre-earnings negative sentiment and the already lowered expectations make a positive surprise less likely. The fact that the stock dipped after the news broke further supports the bearish outlook.  The previous models' predictions range from 0.2 to 0.3 for a price rise and 0.7 to 0.8 for a price fall. Considering this, and the weight of the negative news, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly towards the more pessimistic end of the range.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales, market share losses in China, and increased competition. The removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further underscore a bearish outlook. The reported 25% decline in iPhone shipments to China in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024 adds to the negative sentiment. While the stock was only down a fraction in morning trading, the overall tone of the news and the consensus from previous predictions suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The upcoming earnings report could provide some counterbalance, but the pre-earnings downgrade and lowered forecasts likely dominate the short-term market reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The firm also removed its $250 price target and reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts. The significant decline in iPhone shipments to China (25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024) and increased competition in the Chinese market further exacerbate the negative sentiment.

The upcoming Q1 earnings report may provide some counter-narrative, but the pre-earnings downgrade and lowered forecasts increase the likelihood of a negative market reaction.

The investment firm also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. Additionally, iPhone shipments to China declined significantly in Q4 and for all of 2024. These factors suggest a negative outlook for the company's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which also indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, it is likely that the market sentiment will remain bearish in the short term, especially ahead of the earnings release. However, the actual stock movement will also depend on the earnings results and any forward guidance provided by Apple. Given the predominantly negative news and the consistent bearish sentiment among the previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer, reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, and significant declines in iPhone shipments in China. Several models provided in the previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although the initial market reaction was limited, reflecting some degree of price adjustment prior to the news, the overall tone of the news continues to be negative. The upcoming earnings report carries significant weight but is unlikely to offset the current negative sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, along with the removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, indicates a significant bearish sentiment surrounding Apple's growth prospects.

The previous rounds of predictions overwhelmingly favor a stock price decline, reflecting the negative sentiment surrounding the company's near-term prospects. While the upcoming earnings report could offer a surprise, the pre-earnings downgrade and negative data points make a positive outcome less likely.

The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further solidify this bearish outlook. While the upcoming earnings report could potentially offer a positive surprise, the pre-earnings negative sentiment and lowered expectations make this less likely. The consistent bearish trend across multiple prediction rounds reinforces the negative sentiment.  The initial market reaction, while muted, suggests that some negative impact was already priced in.

Reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further reinforce this bearish sentiment. While the upcoming earnings report could theoretically offer a positive surprise, the pre-earnings negative sentiment and lowered expectations make this unlikely. The consistent bearish trend across multiple prediction rounds, and the fact that the stock dipped slightly after the news broke, strongly suggests that the market has already partially priced in the negative news.
