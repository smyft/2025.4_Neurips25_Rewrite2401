(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Oppenheimer's downgrade, removal of price target, and lowered revenue/EPS forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and the lack of compelling AI applications further exacerbate the negative sentiment. The cited data from Canalys showing significant declines in iPhone shipments to China reinforces these concerns. While the article mentions upcoming Q1 earnings, the overall tone suggests that these earnings may not be strong enough to offset the negative factors. The fact that the stock dipped in morning trading after the news broke is also indicative of negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
