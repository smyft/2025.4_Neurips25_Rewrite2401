(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already set low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade, removal of price target, and lowered revenue/EPS forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and the lack of compelling AI applications further exacerbate the negative sentiment. The cited data from Canalys showing significant declines in iPhone shipments to China reinforces these concerns. While the article mentions upcoming Q1 earnings, the overall tone suggests that these earnings may not be strong enough to offset the negative factors. The fact that the stock dipped in morning trading after the news broke is also indicative of negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative.  Oppenheimer, a reputable firm, downgraded Apple's stock and lowered its price target due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The cited 25% drop in Q4 iPhone shipments to China is significant.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a counter-narrative, the pre-earnings downgrade and lowered revenue/EPS forecasts significantly increase the likelihood of a negative market reaction. The mention of increased competition and a lack of compelling AI applications further fuels the bearish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although a positive earnings surprise could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing slower iPhone sales, market share losses in China, and increased competition. The firm also reduced its revenue and EPS forecasts, which are negative signals for investors. Additionally, the article mentions declining iPhone shipments in China and a slower replacement cycle, further dampening growth prospects. Given these factors, the market sentiment is likely to be bearish in the short term, especially ahead of the earnings release. However, the actual stock movement will also depend on the earnings results and any forward guidance provided by Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The downgrade from Outperform to Perform, along with the removal of a $250 price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, presents a negative outlook. Additionally, the mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth further supports a negative sentiment. Given that the article mentions Apple shares dipped after the downgrade, it suggests an immediate negative impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm also reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth. Additionally, iPhone shipments to China declined significantly in Q4 and for all of 2024. Given this negative news, it is likely that the stock price will fall. However, the article also mentions that the stock was only down a fraction in morning trading, suggesting that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China are significant negative factors. The removal of the price target and reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts further indicate a pessimistic outlook. These factors outweigh any short-term market reaction or upcoming earnings. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of continued downward pressure on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
