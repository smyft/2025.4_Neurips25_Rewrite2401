(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and Meta Surge While AI Giants Crumble--Is the AI Boom Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment for Apple due to a significant increase in stock price following strong demand forecasts for iPhones and a favorable market reaction to advancements in AI technology. The raised iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan suggest improved sales expectations, which could lead to a positive earnings report. However, the overall market sentiment is mixed due to concerns about AI cost deflation affecting other tech giants. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, the stock is already up 3.7% in early afternoon trading, driven by the perception that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) will benefit on-device AI for iPhones. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital indicate lingering concerns about iPhone sales. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a crucial event that could significantly influence the stock price. The DeepSeek news, while positive for Apple's on-device AI prospects, also introduces uncertainty about the overall AI investment landscape, which could indirectly affect Apple. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negative ones in the short term, but the upcoming earnings report introduces significant uncertainty. Therefore, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant jump in iPhone build estimates for the first half of 2025, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from China, and the potential for increased on-device AI capabilities due to the emergence of more cost-effective AI models.  This is further supported by Apple's outperformance compared to other tech giants amidst concerns about AI cost deflation. However, counterbalancing these positives are lingering concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and the stock's current position 12% below recent highs. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining investor sentiment. While the positive news regarding iPhone demand and the potential benefits of cheaper AI models are significant, the existing negative sentiment and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report prevent a strongly bullish prediction.  The overall impact of the DeepSeek news is positive for Apple, as it suggests a shift towards more efficient AI development, benefiting Apple's on-device AI strategy. However, the market reaction to this news is complex and not solely focused on Apple's prospects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a 3.7% jump in stock price due to the perception that smaller, more efficient AI models could benefit iPhone's on-device AI capabilities. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand from China, which could signal strong future sales. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 will be critical. Overall, the positive news about AI and iPhone demand outweighs the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's stock price is likely to rise due to the company's potential to benefit from smaller and more efficient AI models, as well as increased iPhone demand. The article mentions that Apple's stock jumped 3.7% and Meta climbed 0.6% despite the rest of Big Tech taking a beating. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive news and increased demand, but also acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties that could lead to a fall in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighted by a 3.7% increase in stock price due to strong demand forecasts for iPhones and the potential benefits of more efficient AI models. JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25 further support this positive sentiment. However, the stock remains 12% off its recent highs, and there are concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds uncertainty, but the overall positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging the risks that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple. The stock's recent surge, driven by the perception that cost-effective AI models benefit on-device iPhone AI and increased iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan due to strong Chinese demand, are significant positive catalysts. While concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades exist, the immediate market reaction and analyst upgrades suggest a positive short-term trend. The upcoming earnings report is a key event, but the current momentum favors a positive outcome. Considering the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a rise, and the specific positive news regarding AI and iPhone demand, I'm maintaining a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant increase in iPhone build estimates driven by strong Chinese demand, and the potential for on-device AI improvements due to more cost-effective AI models.  Apple's outperformance amidst broader tech sector AI-related declines is also a positive sign. However, counterbalancing these are lingering concerns about iPhone sales (reflected in recent downgrades), and the stock's position 12% below recent highs. The upcoming earnings report is a major uncertainty.  While the positive news is substantial, the existing negative sentiment and the earnings report's potential impact prevent a strongly bullish prediction. The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the uncertainty warrants a more conservative estimate than some of the previous predictions.  I'm factoring in the potential for the market to react negatively to the earnings report, even if the numbers are slightly ahead of consensus.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc.

These factors suggest improved sales expectations and potential positive earnings. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical event that could sway investor sentiment. While the positive catalysts (AI benefits and iPhone demand) seem to outweigh the negatives, the uncertainty around the earnings report and lingering sales concerns temper the bullish outlook. Overall, the probability of the stock price rising is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock price jumped 3.7% due to the perception that smaller, more efficient AI models, like those from DeepSeek, will benefit on-device AI for iPhones.

However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30 introduces significant uncertainty, which prevents a strongly bullish prediction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors for Apple Inc., including a significant increase in stock price driven by perceived benefits from smaller, more efficient AI models for iPhones. JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China. These positive factors outweigh the concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades.
