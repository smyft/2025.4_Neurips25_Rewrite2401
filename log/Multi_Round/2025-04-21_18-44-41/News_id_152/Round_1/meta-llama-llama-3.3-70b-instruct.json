(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights optimism around Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing significant AI investments by companies like Meta, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Dan Ives' comments suggest that the market may be underestimating the potential of these investments, which could lead to a bullish outlook for Apple as it prepares to report earnings. Given the context of strong expectations for tech earnings and the potential for positive surprises, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Dan Ives' positive outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly highlighting the potential of AI spending and Meta's lead in this area. While Apple is mentioned as reporting earnings on Thursday, the primary focus is on the broader tech sector and Meta's AI initiatives. The article suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI investments, which could lead to positive surprises in earnings reports. However, the article doesn't provide specific details about Apple's AI strategy or expected earnings performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and relies on the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. Given the positive sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but the lack of specific Apple-related information keeps the probability from being overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's increased investment in AI, with Apple mentioned only in passing as a company reporting earnings next week.  Dan Ives's comments are largely centered on Meta's AI spending and its potential impact. While positive sentiment towards AI investment exists, the news doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively muted compared to companies directly discussed.  The overall market reaction to Big Tech earnings will be a significant factor, but this news alone doesn't provide a strong indication of whether Apple's stock will rise or fall.  We assume a neutral stance with slightly higher probability of no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments and their potential to drive growth. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech group reporting earnings, and the overall tone suggests optimism about AI-driven monetization and growth. Given the bullish outlook on AI and the broader tech sector, this news is likely to positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock is somewhat indirect, as the primary focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to the positive sector sentiment, while the probability of a fall is low unless earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to be strong, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any negative news or concerns that could lead to a fall in the stock price. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
