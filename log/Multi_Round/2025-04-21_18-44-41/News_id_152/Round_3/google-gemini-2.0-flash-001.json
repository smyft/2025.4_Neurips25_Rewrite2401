(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights optimism around Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing significant AI investments by companies like Meta, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Dan Ives' comments suggest that the market may be underestimating the potential of these investments, which could lead to a bullish outlook for Apple as it prepares to report earnings. Given the context of strong expectations for tech earnings and the potential for positive surprises, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Dan Ives' positive outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly highlighting the potential of AI spending and Meta's lead in this area. While Apple is mentioned as reporting earnings on Thursday, the primary focus is on the broader tech sector and Meta's AI initiatives. The article suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI investments, which could lead to positive surprises in earnings reports. However, the article doesn't provide specific details about Apple's AI strategy or expected earnings performance. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and relies on the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. Given the positive sentiment and the upcoming earnings report, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but the lack of specific Apple-related information keeps the probability from being overwhelmingly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's increased investment in AI, with Apple mentioned only in passing as a company reporting earnings next week.  Dan Ives's comments are largely centered on Meta's AI spending and its potential impact. While positive sentiment towards AI investment exists, the news doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively muted compared to companies directly discussed.  The overall market reaction to Big Tech earnings will be a significant factor, but this news alone doesn't provide a strong indication of whether Apple's stock will rise or fall.  We assume a neutral stance with slightly higher probability of no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments and their potential to drive growth. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the Big Tech group reporting earnings, and the overall tone suggests optimism about AI-driven monetization and growth. Given the bullish outlook on AI and the broader tech sector, this news is likely to positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock is somewhat indirect, as the primary focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending. The probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to the positive sector sentiment, while the probability of a fall is low unless earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to be strong, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This positive sentiment and expectation of strong earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any negative news or concerns that could lead to a fall in the stock price. Therefore, based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive sentiment towards Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing significant AI investments by companies like Meta, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Dan Ives' comments suggest that the market may be underestimating the potential of these investments, which could lead to a bullish outlook for Apple as it prepares to report earnings. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, the overall optimism surrounding AI and the tech sector suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news focuses on positive sentiment surrounding Big Tech earnings, particularly highlighting the potential impact of AI investments. Dan Ives's comments suggest that Wall Street may be underestimating the significance of these investments, which could lead to positive surprises in earnings reports. While the article doesn't provide specific details about Apple's AI strategy or expected earnings performance, the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the upcoming earnings report suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise. Considering the previous predictions, there's a general consensus of positive sentiment, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. I will adjust my prediction slightly to reflect this consensus and the potential for positive surprises in earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's positive outlook, driven largely by anticipated significant AI investments. While Apple is mentioned as reporting earnings soon, the news lacks specific information about Apple's performance or AI strategy.  The positive sentiment surrounding AI spending is likely to have a positive, albeit indirect, influence on Apple's stock price. However, the lack of Apple-specific details prevents a strongly bullish prediction.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.45 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned. The probability of a price fall is relatively low, given the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, but the lack of specific positive news for Apple keeps it above zero.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Big Tech earnings, with a focus on AI investments, particularly by Meta, and mentions Apple (AAPL) as part of the Big Tech group reporting earnings. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI on these companies. While the news is generally positive for the tech sector, its direct impact on Apple's stock is less clear, as the primary focus is on Meta's AI spending. The positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings could indirectly benefit Apple, but without specific information about Apple's performance or AI strategy, the impact is more muted. Considering the overall positive sector sentiment and upcoming earnings, but also the lack of direct Apple-related specifics, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, highlighting Dan Ives' positive outlook on the sector, particularly focusing on AI investments. While Apple is mentioned as reporting earnings on Thursday, the primary focus is on Meta's AI spending and its potential impact. The overall sentiment is positive, suggesting that Wall Street may be underestimating the potential of AI-driven growth. Given the bullish outlook on AI and the broader tech sector, this news is likely to positively influence investor sentiment toward Apple. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock is somewhat indirect, as the primary focus of the news is on Meta's AI spending. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article highlights a positive outlook on Big Tech earnings, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, believes that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI on Big Tech companies, including Apple. This sentiment, combined with the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, suggests a bullish outlook for the tech sector. Given that Apple is part of this sector and is scheduled to report earnings, the positive sentiment is likely to influence investor attitudes towards Apple, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. The lack of specific negative news or concerns about Apple's earnings or performance further supports this assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing significant AI investments by Meta and potentially other companies in the sector. Although the news primarily focuses on Meta's AI spending, it suggests a broader optimism towards AI investments and their potential to drive growth in the tech sector, including Apple. Apple is part of the group of companies reporting earnings next week, and the overall tone indicates a bullish outlook on AI and technology stocks. The news does not provide specific information about Apple's performance or prospects, but the positive sector sentiment and the expectation of strong earnings could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. Given the cumulative predictions from other models, there seems to be a moderate to high chance of a stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally positive sentiment towards Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing significant AI investments by companies like Meta. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Wall Street may be underestimating the potential of these investments, which could lead to a bullish outlook for Apple as it prepares to report earnings. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, the overall optimism surrounding AI and the tech sector suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising compared to falling. Given the consensus from previous predictions, which lean towards a positive sentiment, I estimate a moderate to high probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive, albeit indirect, impact on Apple's stock price due to the overall positive sentiment surrounding Big Tech earnings and AI investments. While the news focuses more on Meta's AI spending, the general optimism in the tech sector, as highlighted by Dan Ives, is expected to positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple as well. The lack of specific negative news about Apple further supports this view. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the indirect positive influence, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is positive for the tech sector as a whole, driven by anticipated strong AI investments.  However, the information is largely focused on Meta's AI spending, with Apple only mentioned in passing as reporting earnings.  While the overall positive sentiment could indirectly benefit Apple, the lack of Apple-specific details weakens the bullish case.  The consensus among previous models shows a range of probabilities for a price rise, mostly between 0.6 and 0.7, with a few outliers. Considering the indirect nature of the news's impact on Apple and the lack of specific information about Apple's performance, I'm adjusting the probability of a price rise slightly lower than the highest predictions, but still reflecting the overall positive sector sentiment. The probability of a price fall remains relatively low, given the general optimism surrounding Big Tech earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, with a focus on AI investments and the positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives.

However, the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or AI strategy tempers the optimism slightly.
