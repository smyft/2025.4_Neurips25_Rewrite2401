(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, historical data shows that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price tends to react minimally. Given the current market conditions and the lack of strong growth predictions for Berkshire, the probability of a stock price rise is low. Conversely, the probability of a stock price fall is moderate due to potential investor sentiment and market reactions leading up to the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B) and its relationship with Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by Apple's results. Historical data shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings have not led to substantial gains for Berkshire. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and analysts are not predicting significant growth. Furthermore, Berkshire's lack of recent stock buybacks suggests that even Warren Buffett may not see the stock as particularly attractive at the moment. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Berkshire Hathaway. The article does not directly mention any news that would affect Apple's stock price, but it does mention that Apple will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales. This could be a positive catalyst for Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Berkshire Hathaway's potential reaction to Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While Apple is Berkshire's largest holding, the historical correlation between their stock price movements is only moderate (0.49). Past instances show that even strong Apple earnings reports haven't resulted in significant Berkshire Hathaway price increases.  The article also highlights concerns about Berkshire Hathaway's valuation and lack of recent stock buybacks, suggesting that even positive Apple news might not significantly impact Berkshire's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of a Berkshire Hathaway stock price rise due to Apple's earnings is low. The probability of a fall is also low, as the news doesn't directly suggest negative factors for Berkshire. The article's main focus is on whether to buy Berkshire Hathaway, not Apple.  Therefore, the analysis focuses on the impact of Apple's news on Berkshire Hathaway, not Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway's performance and its significant holding in Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article highlights that Apple's upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could impact Berkshire Hathaway's stock, but historical data shows only a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks. Past instances indicate that even when Apple's stock soared after earnings, Berkshire's stock saw minimal movement (less than 1-1.7%). The article also suggests that Berkshire's valuation is not currently attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. Given this, the direct impact of Apple's earnings on Berkshire's stock is likely limited, and there's no strong indication that Apple's earnings will significantly affect its own stock price in this context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, it notes that historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not particularly attractive, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6, and that Warren Buffett has not been buying back shares, which could indicate that he does not see the stock as undervalued. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's results is moderate, but not high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. However, historical data shows a moderate correlation between the two companies' stock performances, and Berkshire's stock price has not always reacted strongly to Apple's earnings reports. Additionally, the article notes that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and analysts do not predict exceptional growth for the company. Considering these factors, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising or falling in response to Apple's earnings report is uncertain.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its potential impact based on Apple's upcoming earnings report. The article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price historically has not shown significant movements correlated with Apple's performance. Additionally, the article advises against rushing to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock, emphasizing that it may not be undervalued and its earnings growth is not predicted to be exceptional.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
