It's cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.7. 2025 earnings are expected to rise 30.3%.\n\nBarrick Gold is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nShould a gold miner, like Barrick Gold, be on your short list?\n\n3.

(AAPL) is currently experiencing a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. Despite being a part of the 'Magnificent 7' and having a strong market presence, the high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock may be overvalued. The overall market sentiment and the company's current performance metrics lead to a higher probability of further decline in stock price rather than recovery in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article from Zacks Market Edge mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of the five stocks discussed in their podcast. While the article itself doesn't contain overwhelmingly positive or negative information, it highlights that Apple's stock is down 11.3% year-to-date, trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests a bearish outlook. The article poses the question of whether further declines would present a buying opportunity, implying potential for further price drops. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. However, the mention of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's holding in Apple provides some support, preventing a completely bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The Zacks Market Edge podcast mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of five stocks discussed, alongside companies from diverse sectors.  While the podcast notes Apple's recent decline (11.3% year-to-date) and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell),  it doesn't offer any specific new information or analysis that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The mention itself is brief and part of a broader discussion.  The 'Sell' rating is a factor suggesting potential downward pressure, but it's not a new development and is already reflected in the current market price.  Therefore, the probability of a price movement significantly influenced by this news alone is low.  The probabilities are weighted more towards the existing market trends and overall economic factors rather than this specific podcast mention.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a podcast that analyzes various stocks. Apple is mentioned as a Magnificent 7 stock and part of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire. However, it is noted that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are up only 15.4% over the last year. The article highlights that Apple is not cheap, trading with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The tone of the article suggests caution regarding Apple's stock, indicating potential downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a list of five stocks analyzed in a Zacks Market Edge podcast. Apple is described as a Magnificent 7 stock with a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 4, indicating a sell rating. The discussion suggests that despite the recent weakness, Apple's high P/E ratio makes it not cheap. However, the question is raised as to whether further decline would present a buying opportunity. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a clear catalyst for a significant stock price increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The analysis mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are up 15.4% over the last year. The forward P/E ratio of 30.1 is considered high, and the Zacks Rank is a 4, or Sell. However, Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on various market and economic factors. Since the article does not provide a clear positive or negative outlook, the probabilities are estimated based on the neutral tone of the analysis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s recent stock performance and its current valuation metrics. The news highlights that Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and is currently trading with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered expensive. Additionally, it has a Zacks Rank of 4, indicating a 'Sell' rating. The overall tone of the news suggests cautious sentiment towards Apple, despite its strong historical performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. The high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock may be overvalued, contributing to a cautious outlook. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and has strong backing from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, the overall tone of the news is neutral to slightly negative, with no clear catalysts for a price increase. This leads to a higher probability of further decline in stock price rather than recovery in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a negative outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its year-to-date decline, high P/E ratio, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). While it's a 'Magnificent 7' stock and held by Berkshire Hathaway, the current sentiment suggests more downside risk. The news article itself doesn't offer any new positive catalysts. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the lack of positive news, the probability of a further price fall remains higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece is a summary of a podcast discussing several stocks, including Apple.  While it mentions Apple's recent decline (11.3% year-to-date), high P/E ratio (30.1), and Zacks Rank 4 (Sell), it doesn't offer any new, impactful information. The podcast's question about whether further decline would create a buying opportunity suggests uncertainty, not a definitive prediction.  The previous predictions range from 0.25 to 0.45 probability of a price rise, and 0.55 to 0.75 probability of a price fall.  Considering the lack of significant new information in this news and the existing bearish sentiment reflected in the Zacks Rank and P/E ratio, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall. However, the range of previous predictions suggests considerable uncertainty, and the news itself is not a strong catalyst for either a significant rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.

Based on the information provided, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.

Moreover, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), suggesting bearish sentiment. Although mentioned as a Magnificent 7 stock and part of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, the overall tone and metrics point towards a higher probability of further declines. The probabilities presented in previous rounds generally lean towards a higher probability of stock price falling, with most models predicting between 60-75% likelihood of decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. The high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock may be overvalued, contributing to a cautious outlook. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and has strong backing from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, the overall tone of the news is neutral to slightly negative, with no clear catalysts for a price increase. This leads to a higher probability of further decline in stock price rather than recovery in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment surrounding Apple (AAPL) in the provided news and previous predictions heavily influences this assessment. The key factors are the year-to-date decline of 11.3%, the high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and the Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). While Apple's status as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and its backing by Berkshire Hathaway offer some support, they are insufficient to outweigh the bearish signals. The news article itself doesn't introduce any new positive catalysts, and the trend in previous predictions reinforces the expectation of further price decline. Therefore, the probability of a price fall remains significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news piece is a brief mention of Apple within a broader podcast discussing multiple companies.  While it highlights Apple's recent decline (11.3% year-to-date), high P/E ratio (30.1), and Zacks Rank 4 (Sell), it provides no new, significant information to alter the existing market sentiment. The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.75.  The lack of positive news and the continued bearish indicators (high P/E, Zacks Sell rating) reinforce this negative outlook.  While Apple's status as a 'Magnificent 7' company and its association with Warren Buffett offer some support, these factors are already priced into the market. Therefore, I'm maintaining a higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.

However, it notes a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The tone of the article is neutral to slightly negative, suggesting caution due to overvaluation and bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most estimates ranging between 0.6 to 0.75. Given the lack of positive catalysts and the prevailing bearish indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is assessed to be higher than that of rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article from Zacks Market Edge discusses Apple Inc.

The news article itself doesn't introduce any new positive catalysts, and the trend in previous predictions reinforces the expectation of further price decline.

The consensus from previous rounds is strongly bearish, and there's no new information to suggest a reversal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news piece is a brief mention of Apple within a larger podcast covering multiple companies.  While it highlights negative aspects \u2013 a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a high P/E ratio of 30.1, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) \u2013 it offers no new, significant information to drastically shift market sentiment.  The consistent negative sentiment across previous prediction rounds, focusing on the high P/E ratio and sell rating, heavily influences my assessment.  Apple's status as a 'Magnificent 7' company and its association with Warren Buffett provide some support, but these factors are likely already priced into the market.  The lack of positive news and the prevailing bearish indicators suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, the news itself is not a strong catalyst for a significant price movement in either direction.  Considering the consensus from previous models and the lack of positive news, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock price predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.
