A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently experiencing a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. Despite being a part of the 'Magnificent 7' and having a strong market presence, the high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock may be overvalued. The overall market sentiment and the company's current performance metrics lead to a higher probability of further decline in stock price rather than recovery in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article from Zacks Market Edge mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of the five stocks discussed in their podcast. While the article itself doesn't contain overwhelmingly positive or negative information, it highlights that Apple's stock is down 11.3% year-to-date, trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests a bearish outlook. The article poses the question of whether further declines would present a buying opportunity, implying potential for further price drops. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. However, the mention of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's holding in Apple provides some support, preventing a completely bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The Zacks Market Edge podcast mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of five stocks discussed, alongside companies from diverse sectors.  While the podcast notes Apple's recent decline (11.3% year-to-date) and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell),  it doesn't offer any specific new information or analysis that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The mention itself is brief and part of a broader discussion.  The 'Sell' rating is a factor suggesting potential downward pressure, but it's not a new development and is already reflected in the current market price.  Therefore, the probability of a price movement significantly influenced by this news alone is low.  The probabilities are weighted more towards the existing market trends and overall economic factors rather than this specific podcast mention.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a podcast that analyzes various stocks. Apple is mentioned as a Magnificent 7 stock and part of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire. However, it is noted that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are up only 15.4% over the last year. The article highlights that Apple is not cheap, trading with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The tone of the article suggests caution regarding Apple's stock, indicating potential downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a list of five stocks analyzed in a Zacks Market Edge podcast. Apple is described as a Magnificent 7 stock with a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 4, indicating a sell rating. The discussion suggests that despite the recent weakness, Apple's high P/E ratio makes it not cheap. However, the question is raised as to whether further decline would present a buying opportunity. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but it does not provide a clear catalyst for a significant stock price increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks analyzed by Zacks Market Edge. The analysis mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are up 15.4% over the last year. The forward P/E ratio of 30.1 is considered high, and the Zacks Rank is a 4, or Sell. However, Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the four pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on various market and economic factors. Since the article does not provide a clear positive or negative outlook, the probabilities are estimated based on the neutral tone of the analysis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s recent stock performance and its current valuation metrics. The news highlights that Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and is currently trading with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered expensive. Additionally, it has a Zacks Rank of 4, indicating a 'Sell' rating. The overall tone of the news suggests cautious sentiment towards Apple, despite its strong historical performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
