A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple and Google facing a probe in the UK regarding their mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory scrutiny, which can create uncertainty for investors. Such investigations can lead to potential fines or changes in business practices, which may negatively impact stock prices. However, Apple's strong market position and previous resilience to regulatory challenges may mitigate the negative impact. Therefore, while there is a significant chance of a price decline due to the news, the overall strength of the company may also support a smaller chance of price stability or increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty and can lead to potential fines or changes in business practices, which investors typically view negatively. While the full impact is unknown without access to the full article, the initial headline suggests a potential negative impact. The lack of details in the provided excerpt makes a precise probability assessment difficult, but the presence of a regulatory probe generally leans towards a negative outlook in the short term. The fact that the article is behind a paywall suggests it contains potentially market-moving information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  While the specifics of the probe are unknown due to the paywalled nature of the article, regulatory investigations generally carry uncertainty and potential negative consequences.  A significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's profitability and stock price. However, Apple is a large, established company with significant resources to navigate such investigations.  The impact is likely to be relatively small compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price, such as overall market conditions, product releases, and financial performance. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price, rather than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges. Historically, such investigations can create uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors, often leading to short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position and financial resilience may mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to the immediate negative implications of regulatory scrutiny, but the probability of a rise is lower unless Apple's response is particularly reassuring or the market perceives the probe as insignificant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, restrictions on business practices, or even fines for the companies involved. Historically, such investigations and regulatory actions have had a negative impact on tech stocks, as they can limit the companies' ability to operate freely or lead to financial penalties. Given this context, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising seems lower than the probability of it falling, as the news could be perceived as negative for the company's future prospects and profitability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, it's also possible that the companies may be able to navigate these regulatory challenges without significant harm to their business or reputation, potentially limiting the downside impact on their stock prices. Given the uncertainty and potential risks associated with regulatory probes, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that both Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a probe by UK authorities into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Such regulatory scrutiny often leads to negative market sentiment as it can affect the companies' operations, revenue streams, and overall profitability. Given the competitive landscape and the potential implications for business practices, there is a higher likelihood of investor concerns leading to a potential short-term sell-off.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
