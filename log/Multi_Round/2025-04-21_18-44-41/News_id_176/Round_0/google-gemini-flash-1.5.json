While the specifics of the probe are unknown due to the paywalled nature of the article, regulatory investigations generally carry uncertainty and potential negative consequences.  A significant fine or mandated changes could negatively impact Apple's profitability and stock price. However, Apple is a large, established company with significant resources to navigate such investigations.  The impact is likely to be relatively small compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price, such as overall market conditions, product releases, and financial performance. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price, rather than a significant rise or fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
