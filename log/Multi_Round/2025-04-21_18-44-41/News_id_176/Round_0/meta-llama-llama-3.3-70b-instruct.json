This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased costs, legal liabilities, or changes in their business practices, which might negatively impact their stock prices. However, it's also possible that the companies may be able to navigate these regulatory challenges without significant harm to their business or reputation, potentially limiting the downside impact on their stock prices.
