(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) is facing a challenging environment with recent stock performance lagging behind its peers in the Magnificent 7 group. Concerns about its AI strategy and ongoing issues in China have contributed to a 15% decline from its 52-week high. While some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect a potential AI partnership announcement, the overall bearish outlook and the possibility of a guidance cut weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially in the context of the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall earnings season is strong and Apple's Q4 margins are expected to be modestly up, the stock has underperformed, losing 15% since its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Analyst sentiment is somewhat bearish, with some projecting a guidance cut and estimates for future fiscal years being revised downwards. However, bulls believe the China issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce an AI partnership soon. The article also highlights the strong performance of other Mag 7 companies, particularly Tesla, which could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards the tech sector as a whole. Given the negative sentiment and downward revisions, a price fall is slightly more probable, but the potential for a positive earnings surprise or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a rise significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the overall market sentiment is positive, with strong Q4 earnings expectations for the S&P 500 and the 'Magnificent 7', Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, putting downward pressure on the stock. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships in the Chinese AI market as a positive catalyst.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly improve, which is a positive factor.  Considering the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted, with a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, although the magnitude of the movement is uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights several key points about Apple Inc. (AAPL): 1) The stock has underperformed recently, losing about 15% of its value due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. 2) Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 have been declining. 3) However, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential AI partnerships (e.g., with Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). 4) Apple's net margins are expected to be modestly up year-over-year. Given the mixed sentiment, the stock's reaction will likely depend on whether the earnings report and guidance alleviate or confirm these concerns. The probability of a rise is tempered by the potential for positive surprises in AI strategy or margins, while the probability of a fall is supported by ongoing China risks and downward EPS revisions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has been struggling lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone, acknowledging China headwinds but expecting a local AI partner announcement soon. Given the current sentiment and expectations, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports for several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. The overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index is strong, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026. Given the mixed sentiments and expectations, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been underperforming compared to its peers and the broader market, primarily due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Despite some analysts projecting a guidance cut, there are bullish views suggesting that the negative sentiment is overdone and that Apple might announce a local AI partner soon. Tesla's stock performance contrasts with Apple's, showing a positive trend despite similar concerns, which could affect investor perception. However, Apple's upcoming earnings and the potential for a positive AI-related announcement may influence its stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q4 earnings report. While the overall earnings season appears strong, Apple's stock has underperformed recently, losing about 15% of its value due to concerns about its AI strategy and issues in China. Analysts are divided, with some projecting a guidance cut and downward revisions in EPS estimates, while others believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect potential positive developments, such as an AI partnership announcement. Given the bearish sentiment and the potential for a price fall, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling, but the possibility of a rise remains significant due to the upcoming earnings report and potential positive surprises.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a slightly negative outlook for Apple, primarily due to concerns about its China market and AI strategy. The stock has already experienced a 15% drop, and bearish analysts anticipate a guidance cut. While some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect a potential AI partnership announcement, the overall trend and analyst sentiment suggest continued downward pressure. The strong earnings season overall and Apple's expected margin improvement offer some counterweight, but the prevailing concerns outweigh these positives. Given the trend of previous predictions and the continued concerns, I am slightly more bearish than the average of the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader market and many S&P 500 companies show strong Q4 earnings, Apple's stock has underperformed significantly due to China-related concerns and uncertainty about its AI strategy.  Bearish sentiment is fueled by potential guidance cuts and downward revisions of future fiscal year EPS estimates. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone, pointing to the possibility of a new AI partnership in China as a potential catalyst.  Apple's expected modest margin improvement is a positive factor.  Considering the conflicting signals and the previous predictions which range from 0.35 to 0.55 probability of a price rise, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the weight of the negative factors (underperformance, China concerns, potential guidance cut). However, the potential for a positive surprise related to AI partnerships keeps the probability of a rise significant. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, which I will take into account.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) reveals a mixed sentiment. On the negative side, Apple's stock has underperformed recently, losing about 15% of its value due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 have been declining. On the positive side, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential AI partnerships with companies like Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance. Additionally, Apple's net margins are expected to be modestly up year-over-year. Given these mixed signals, the stock's reaction will likely depend on whether the earnings report and guidance alleviate or confirm these concerns. The probability of a rise is tempered by the potential for positive surprises in AI strategy or margins, while the probability of a fall is supported by ongoing China risks and downward EPS revisions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

However, Apple bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and potential AI partnerships. Given the mixed sentiment, with both positive and negative views presented, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on the news. The recent performance of other Mag7 companies, particularly Tesla's strong showing, could also influence investor sentiment towards tech stocks. Overall, while there are valid concerns, the potential for positive surprises in AI strategy or margins could temper the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

(AAPL). On one hand, the stock has underperformed, with a decline of about 15% since its 52-week high due to concerns over China and AI strategy. There is also bearish sentiment regarding a potential guidance cut and downward revisions in future EPS estimates. On the other hand, there are bulls who believe the negative sentiment is overdone and that Apple might announce a local AI partner, which could positively impact the stock. The recent strong earnings for Tesla and positive overall market trends may also influence investor sentiment.
