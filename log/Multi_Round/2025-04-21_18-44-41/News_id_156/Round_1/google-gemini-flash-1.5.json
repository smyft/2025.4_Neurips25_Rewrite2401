(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple enlisting Kim Vorrath to improve its AI and Siri capabilities suggests a strategic move to address the company's shortcomings in the AI space. This could be seen positively by investors, as it indicates a commitment to enhancing product offerings and competitiveness. However, the challenges Apple faces in catching up with competitors like OpenAI and Google, along with the criticism of Siri's current performance, may temper enthusiasm. Overall, the news is likely to be viewed as a step in the right direction, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is taking steps to address its perceived shortcomings in AI, particularly with Siri. While the appointment of a veteran executive like Kim Vorrath signals a commitment to improvement and efficient execution, it also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI capabilities relative to competitors. The article mentions past failures and delays, as well as criticisms of current AI offerings. The fact that Apple is bringing in someone known for 'fixing troubled products' suggests the situation is viewed internally as needing significant improvement. The negative aspects of the news (falling behind competitors, Siri's shortcomings, inaccurate AI-generated news) are balanced by the positive aspects (Vorrath's appointment, focus on improving AI infrastructure, planned Siri overhaul). Given the mixed signals, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate. The market may react positively to the commitment to AI, but concerns about Apple's current position could temper enthusiasm. I am giving a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, as the market generally reacts positively to news of companies addressing strategic weaknesses, especially in a key area like AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's efforts to improve its AI capabilities and Siri, areas where it has lagged behind competitors.  While the appointment of a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products is positive, the news also highlights existing challenges and past setbacks, including criticism of Siri's performance and inaccurate AI-generated news recaps.  The fact that this is a significant internal restructuring to address a known weakness suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative aspects. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore moderate, as the move is a step in the right direction but doesn't guarantee immediate success. The probability of a price fall is low, as the news doesn't reveal any major negative developments beyond what was already known.  The overall impact is likely to be relatively neutral in the short term, with potential for positive movement in the longer term if the improvements to AI and Siri are successful.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products and managing major projects. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its perceived shortcomings in AI, which could be viewed positively by investors as a step towards future growth and competitiveness. However, the news also underscores Apple's current lag behind peers like OpenAI, Google, and Samsung in AI, which might raise concerns about its ability to catch up.
