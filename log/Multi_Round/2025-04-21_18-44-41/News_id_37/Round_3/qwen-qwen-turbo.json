(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple reports record earnings, but misses on iPhone estimates\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) met Wall Street\u2019s expectations with fiscal first-quarter earnings driven by the holiday season.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenues of $124.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 \u2014 a 4% increase year over year. Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported strong earnings, meeting the expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share, which is positive. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which raises concerns about future sales particularly as it may indicate weakening demand for iPhones. Despite the record earnings report, analysts remain cautious about future growth and some have downgraded Apple, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. After-hours trading initially saw a rise in shares, indicating some optimism, but ongoing concerns about future product sales and demand might lead to a tempered outlook. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a price increase but also acknowledge the risks of a price drop due to unmet expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings, meeting overall revenue and EPS expectations. This is generally positive. However, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, a significant concern given the iPhone's importance to Apple's overall performance. The after-hours trading rise suggests an initial positive reaction to the overall record earnings and the forward guidance of \"low to mid single digit\" growth for the March quarter. However, the market had closed down for the day (-0.74% and -5.1% YTD), and the missed iPhone targets could temper enthusiasm. Furthermore, the Jefferies downgrade mentioning weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, coupled with concerns around the iPhone SE 4 demand, creates a negative sentiment in the medium term. The market's reaction is likely going to be mixed, initially rising but falling later due to the poor forecast of iPhone sales.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings, exceeding expectations on revenue and EPS. However, iPhone sales missed expectations, and guidance for the next quarter also fell short of analyst predictions.  While the exceeding overall earnings initially pushed the stock price up in after-hours trading, the miss on iPhone sales and weaker-than-expected guidance are significant negative factors. Jefferies' prior downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales further contribute to a bearish outlook. The positive aspect of record earnings and exceeding expectations in other areas is counterbalanced by the negative points about missed expectations and weaker future guidance.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall movement might be relatively modest due to the record earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported record earnings, meeting Wall Street's expectations with a 4% year-over-year revenue increase and higher-than-expected EPS and net income. The CEO's optimistic remarks about future growth and the rollout of new features like Apple Intelligence could boost investor confidence. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which is significant since the iPhone is Apple's flagship product. Additionally, analyst downgrades and cautious outlooks on future iPhone models (e.g., iPhone 17/18 and SE 4) could weigh on the stock. The after-hours trading showed a 3% rise, suggesting short-term optimism, but the year-to-date decline of 5.1% reflects underlying concerns. Balancing these factors, the stock is likely to experience volatility with a slight edge toward a rise due to the overall positive earnings report and guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings, but missed on iPhone estimates. The company's revenues and earnings per share met expectations, but iPhone revenue was lower than anticipated. Despite this, Apple shares rose in after-hours trading due to optimistic guidance for the March quarter. The mixed results and cautious outlook from Jefferies analysts, who downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform,' may influence investor sentiment. However, the overall positive earnings report and the expectation of 'low to mid single digits' growth on an annual basis for the March quarter could support the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The company reported record earnings, meeting Wall Street's expectations, with a 4% increase in revenue year over year. However, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, which could potentially negatively impact the stock price. Despite this, Apple's guidance for the March quarter was more optimistic than expected, with 'low to mid single digits' growth, which could lead to a stock price increase. Considering these mixed signals, the stock price movement will depend on how investors weigh the company's overall performance against the missed iPhone estimates. Given the record earnings and positive guidance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. Additionally, the guidance for the next quarter suggests low to mid-single digit growth, which could be seen as modest compared to previous quarters. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While the record earnings and meeting overall revenue expectations are positive, the miss on iPhone revenue estimates is a significant concern, as the iPhone is Apple's flagship product. The initial after-hours trading bump suggests positive investor sentiment due to the record earnings and optimistic guidance, but the Jefferies downgrade citing weak future iPhone sales and lackluster demand for the iPhone SE 4 introduces doubt. Considering Jefferies originally predicted a miss and the current results validate some of their concerns, their outlook heavily influenced by Asia supply chain knowledge weighs heavily. The previous predictions ranged from 0.35 to 0.6 for a price rise, reflecting the inherent uncertainty due to the mixed news. I'm reducing the probability of a rise compared to the average of the previous predictions because Jefferies' concerns about future iPhone sales are hard to ignore.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's report presents a mixed bag. While exceeding expectations in overall revenue and EPS, the miss on iPhone sales is a significant negative.  This is amplified by Jefferies' downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales. The positive aspects (record earnings, positive, albeit modest, guidance) are countered by the negative (missed iPhone sales expectations, analyst downgrades, concerns about future product demand). The initial post-earnings market reaction (3% rise after-hours) suggests some short-term optimism based on the record earnings overall. However, the longer-term outlook is clouded by the iPhone miss and the cautious guidance. Considering the previous predictions, which range widely from 0.35 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, and the inherent uncertainty, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a fall due to the significant concerns about iPhone sales. The overall trend indicated by the previous predictions and the mixed nature of the earnings report leans slightly toward a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported record earnings, meeting Wall Street's expectations with a 4% year-over-year revenue increase and higher-than-expected EPS and net income. The CEO's optimistic remarks about future growth and the rollout of new features like Apple Intelligence could boost investor confidence. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which is significant since the iPhone is Apple's flagship product. Additionally, analyst downgrades and cautious outlooks on future iPhone models (e.g., iPhone 17/18 and SE 4) could weigh on the stock. The after-hours trading showed a 3% rise, suggesting short-term optimism, but the year-to-date decline of 5.1% reflects underlying concerns. Balancing these factors, the stock is likely to experience volatility with a slight edge toward a rise due to the overall positive earnings report and guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported record earnings, meeting overall revenue and EPS expectations, but missed iPhone revenue estimates. The company's guidance for the March quarter suggests 'low to mid single digits' growth, which is somewhat modest. Despite the positive aspects of the earnings report, the missed iPhone targets and cautious outlook from analysts, including a downgrade by Jefferies, create a mixed sentiment. The stock rose in after-hours trading initially but has been down 5.1% year-to-date. Balancing these factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall positive earnings report and guidance, but the risks of a price drop due to unmet iPhone expectations and future growth concerns are significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Apple's mixed earnings report presents a complex picture for investors. While the company reported record earnings, meeting expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share, it missed iPhone revenue estimates. This miss is significant due to the iPhone's importance to Apple's overall performance. However, the after-hours trading saw a rise in shares, indicating some initial optimism, possibly due to the record earnings and the forward guidance of 'low to mid single digits' growth for the March quarter. The downgrade by Jefferies and concerns about future iPhone sales introduce negativity. Given these mixed signals, and considering the probabilities provided by other models which range from a slight edge towards a rise to a slight edge towards a fall, a balanced approach seems reasonable. The positivity from the record earnings and guidance is counterbalanced by the negativity from the missed iPhone estimates and cautious analyst outlooks. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling should reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the overall positive earnings report but also acknowledging the significant risks and uncertainties, especially regarding future iPhone sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share, which is positive. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which is significant. This miss could indicate potential challenges in the key product line, potentially impacting future growth. Additionally, Jefferies' downgrade and concerns over future iPhone models like the iPhone 17/18 and SE 4 could further weigh on investor sentiment. Yet, the guidance for the March quarter offers some optimism with 'low to mid single digits' growth, which could support a somewhat positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported record earnings and exceeded overall revenue and EPS expectations, which are positive indicators for investor sentiment. However, the company missed on iPhone revenue estimates, raising concerns about future sales, especially with analyst downgrades suggesting weak demand for upcoming models. The company\u2019s guidance for \u2018low to mid single digits\u2019 growth is also somewhat modest compared to previous expectations. After-hours trading saw a rise in share price, indicating some initial optimism, but the year-to-date decline and mixed analyst outlook suggest that caution will prevail. Overall, given the strong earnings but mixed signals regarding iPhone sales, there's a slight inclination towards a price rise, but significant risks remain which also warrant a substantial probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The key factors influencing Apple's stock price are the record earnings balanced against the missed iPhone revenue expectations. The initial after-hours trading jump showed optimism, but the downgrade from Jefferies and concerns about future iPhone sales (17/18 and SE 4) temper this. Prior rounds of predictions varied, reflecting the mixed signals; most models hover near 50/50 splits or lean slightly positive. Considering this and Jefferies' cautionary stance, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than from Round 0, but the positive earnings still provide some cushion. The after hour trading showing a 3% rise does suggest some confidence but the missed iPhone revenue still is concerning. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: Apple's earnings report presents a mixed picture. While record overall earnings and meeting expectations on key metrics like revenue and EPS are positive, the significant miss on iPhone sales is a major cause for concern.  This miss, coupled with a Jefferies downgrade citing weak future iPhone sales and concerns over the iPhone SE 4, casts a shadow of doubt on future performance.  The initial after-hours price increase reflects a short-term positive reaction to the record earnings, but the longer-term outlook is uncertain.  The predictions from various models in previous rounds show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty.  Considering the missed iPhone sales, the negative analyst sentiment, and the overall uncertainty, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise. However, the record earnings and positive, albeit modest, forward guidance prevent the probability of a fall from being overwhelmingly high. The overall trend indicated by previous predictions and the mixed nature of the earnings report leans slightly toward a fall, but with significant uncertainty, indicating a relatively even split in probabilities, favoring a fall by a small margin.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

(AAPL). On the positive side, the company reported record earnings, meeting and exceeding Wall Street's expectations with revenue and EPS. The CEO's optimistic remarks and new AI features could boost investor confidence. However, missing the iPhone revenue estimates highlights concerns over the flagship product's future sales. Jefferies' downgrade and cautious outlook on future models further add to these concerns. Initial after-hours trading showed a rise, but long-term outlook remains uncertain. Balancing the mixed signals provided by previous rounds of predictions, there's a tendency towards a slight positive bias despite the mixed outcomes.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
