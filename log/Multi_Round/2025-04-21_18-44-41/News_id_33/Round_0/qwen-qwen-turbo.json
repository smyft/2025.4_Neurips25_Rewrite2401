Such underperformance in a core segment could dampen investor sentiment, particularly given high market expectations of Apple. However, the overall revenue growth, albeit modest, indicates the company isn't struggling and remains financially robust. This mixed signal suggests a cautious market reaction where a slight dip is more probable than a strong surge, but substantial volatility is likely.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}"
