(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The decrease in iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver for Apple, indicates potential challenges in meeting investor expectations. Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales relative to analyst projections can create negative sentiment among investors, leading to potential downward pressure on the stock price. As a result, there is a greater likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising, especially as investors are awaiting a payoff from AI initiatives that have yet to materialize.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2023 earnings showed a slight miss on iPhone sales, falling short of analyst expectations. While overall revenue showed a modest increase, the decline in iPhone sales, its most valuable product, is a concern. The news highlights the market's anticipation of an AI-driven growth spurt that hasn't yet materialized.  Investors are likely to react negatively to the missed expectations in the short term, potentially causing a price drop. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the anticipation of future AI advancements could limit the extent of the decline.  The long-term outlook for Apple remains positive due to its strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and potential for AI integration. Therefore, the probability of a price fall immediately following this news is considered higher than a price rise, but the fall is expected to be limited and potentially followed by a recovery as investors reassess the AI potential.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone sales fell slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the company's total revenue still rose by almost 4% year-over-year, suggesting some resilience. The mention of AI as a potential future growth driver may mitigate some negative reactions, but the immediate miss on iPhone sales is likely to weigh more heavily on the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's iPhone sales have declined slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst projections. Although the total revenue increased by almost 4% from the same quarter last year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, may be perceived negatively by investors. The market was likely expecting more significant growth driven by artificial intelligence (AI) software. Given that the news did not meet investor expectations regarding iPhone sales and the AI-driven growth, it is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price. However, the overall revenue increase and the company's ability to maintain growth could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales for Apple, which is a key product and significant revenue source for the company. This decline, although small, misses analyst projections and might indicate that the anticipated growth from artificial-intelligence software has not yet materialized. However, Apple's total revenue still saw an increase, suggesting that other segments of the company's business are performing well. Considering these factors, the news has both positive and negative aspects for investors. The slight decline in iPhone sales and the miss on projections could lead to a negative reaction, but the overall revenue growth might mitigate this effect. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising due to this mixed news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's reported slight decline in iPhone sales in the December quarter falls short of analyst expectations and signals that the anticipated impact from AI software on their key product isn't materializing yet. Such underperformance in a core segment could dampen investor sentiment, particularly given high market expectations of Apple. However, the overall revenue growth, albeit modest, indicates the company isn't struggling and remains financially robust. This mixed signal suggests a cautious market reaction where a slight dip is more probable than a strong surge, but substantial volatility is likely.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which missed analyst expectations, thus likely leading to negative investor sentiment in the short term. While total revenue increased, the decline in iPhone sales, a critical product for Apple, could overshadow this positive news. The anticipation of future AI-driven growth hasn't yet materialized, further contributing to caution among investors. Given this context and the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a decrease in stock price due to these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of AAPL stock falling due to the slightly negative iPhone sales figures, which missed analyst expectations despite overall revenue growth. The lack of immediate AI payoff adds to the concern. However, others' predictions have a distribution from 0.35-0.45 for the stock price to rise. Taking into account the overall revenue growth and historical resilience of AAPL, while I agree that the immediate reaction will be negative, I slightly adjust the probability to account for factors others may be aware of, indicating positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple's overall revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, is a significant negative.  This miss is particularly concerning as the iPhone is Apple's most important product, and the anticipated AI-driven growth has not yet materialized.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 probability.  The fact that several models independently arrived at similar conclusions strengthens this prediction. While the overall revenue increase provides some support, the shortfall in iPhone sales, the core driver of Apple's value, likely outweighs this positive aspect in the short-term market reaction. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a price fall, though less extreme than some of the previous predictions, reflecting the mitigating effect of the overall revenue increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales for Apple, which is a key revenue driver, missing analyst expectations. This could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term, especially given the high expectations surrounding AI-driven growth. However, Apple's total revenue still showed a modest increase, suggesting resilience in other areas of the business. The mixed signals from the news, with a slight miss in iPhone sales but overall revenue growth, suggest a higher probability of a negative reaction in the stock price due to the importance of the iPhone segment. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of around 0.65 for a fall and 0.35 for a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone sales fell slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations. While the total revenue increased by almost 4% year-over-year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, may be perceived negatively by investors. The market was likely expecting more significant growth driven by artificial intelligence (AI) software. Given that the news did not meet investor expectations regarding iPhone sales and the AI-driven growth, it is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the anticipation of future AI advancements could limit the extent of the decline. Therefore, the probability of a price fall immediately following this news is considered higher than a price rise, but the fall is expected to be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales for Apple, which is a key product and significant revenue source for the company. This decline, although small, misses analyst projections and might indicate that the anticipated growth from artificial-intelligence software has not yet materialized. However, Apple's total revenue still saw an increase, suggesting that other segments of the company's business are performing well. Considering the mixed reactions from various models, with predictions ranging from 0.3 to 0.45 for a stock price rise, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the immediate disappointment in iPhone sales. Yet, the resilience in total revenue and the potential for future AI-driven growth could mitigate the decline, making the probability of a fall slightly higher than that of a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a minor decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product. Despite overall revenue growth, the miss on iPhone sales expectations may negatively impact investor sentiment. The market's anticipation of an AI-driven boost has not yet been realized, potentially leading to a cautious or slightly pessimistic market reaction. Previous predictions suggest a similar trend of lower chances of rising stock prices due to this news.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news about Apple indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, which missed analyst expectations. The iPhone is a critical revenue driver for Apple, and any decline in its sales can negatively impact investor sentiment. While total revenue did rise by almost 4%, the negative news regarding iPhone sales is likely to overshadow this positive aspect. Additionally, there are concerns about the anticipated AI-driven growth not materializing yet, which could lead to caution among investors. The majority of previous predictions reflect a general consensus leaning toward a higher probability of the stock price falling, given the mixed signals from the report. Therefore, I predict a higher chance of a price decrease following this news, with a possibility of minor resistance to the decline due to Apple's overall financial resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The slight miss in iPhone sales, a key product, is a concern, especially since it fell short of analyst expectations and the anticipated AI payoff hasn't materialized. This negative sentiment is weighed against the positive aspect of overall revenue growth. Previous rounds show a consistent leaning towards a higher probability of stock price decline. However, several models considered the overall revenue growth and the inherent strength of Apple, moderately decreasing the predicted probability of a price fall. Taking these factors into account, plus other predictions (which might have extra information), I maintain the trend of a likely price decrease, but I slightly adjust the probability to consider the mitigating effect of overall growth, the expectation of AI growth in the future and the unknown factors taken into consideration by others.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple's overall revenue increased, the slight decrease in iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, is a significant negative. This is concerning because the iPhone is Apple's most important product, and the anticipated AI-driven growth hasn't materialized.  The consistent prediction from multiple models in previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 probability. This consensus strengthens the prediction of a fall.  The overall revenue increase provides some mitigation, but the iPhone shortfall likely outweighs this positive in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio, coupled with long-term potential in AI, could limit the extent of any decline. Considering the mixed signals and the consensus of previous predictions, I'm adjusting the probability of a fall slightly lower than the average of previous rounds to account for the mitigating effect of the overall revenue increase and the potential for future growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple's slight decline in iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment, especially given the importance of the iPhone as a key revenue driver. Although total revenue showed a modest increase, the miss on iPhone sales and the absence of anticipated AI-driven growth could overshadow this positive aspect. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 0.6-0.7 probability of a fall. The mixed signals from the news, combined with the market's forward-looking nature and high expectations for Apple, suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term negative reaction. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's iPhone sales fell slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations. While the total revenue increased by almost 4% year-over-year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, may be perceived negatively by investors. The market was likely expecting more significant growth driven by artificial intelligence (AI) software. Given that the news did not meet investor expectations regarding iPhone sales and the AI-driven growth, it is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the anticipation of future AI advancements could limit the extent of the decline. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a mixed picture for Apple, with a slight decline in iPhone sales missing analyst expectations, but overall revenue increasing by almost 4%. The importance of iPhone sales to Apple's revenue and the miss on analyst expectations are significant negative factors. However, the total revenue growth and the potential for future AI-driven growth are positive aspects. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the disappointment in iPhone sales, but also taking into account the resilience in total revenue and the potential for future growth, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a minor decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product. Despite overall revenue growth, the miss on iPhone sales expectations may negatively impact investor sentiment. The market's anticipation of an AI-driven boost has not yet been realized, potentially leading to a cautious or slightly pessimistic market reaction. Previous predictions suggest a similar trend of lower chances of rising stock prices due to this news.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a slight decline in iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations. Since the iPhone is a key revenue driver for Apple, this development is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Although Apple's overall revenue grew by nearly 4%, the disappointment regarding iPhone sales may overshadow this positive aspect. Given the anticipation of AI contributions to growth that have yet to materialize, investors may respond cautiously. The previous predictions largely support a higher probability of stock price falling due to the missed sales projections. Overall, while there is some resilience indicated by total revenue growth, the predominant sentiment leans towards a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The slight miss in iPhone sales, a key product and revenue driver, is a concern, especially considering it fell short of analyst expectations and that the anticipated AI payoff hasn't materialized. This negative sentiment, coupled with consistent predictions across multiple rounds favoring a stock price decline, suggests downward pressure. Despite an almost 4% increase in total revenue, the market is likely to react more strongly to weakness in iPhone sales. However, Apple's financial strength, brand reputation, and future AI growth potential could limit the extent of the fall. Moreover, the consideration of others' predictions might indicate that they have some positive information about the stock that I may have overlooked. Although there is a consensus towards the stock price falling, there are also minor adjustments towards the stock price rising, due to the overall financial resiliance and future growth potential. Therefore, although I predict the stock price will fall, I also consider the adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple's overall revenue increased slightly, the decline in iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, is a significant negative. This is particularly concerning given that the iPhone is Apple's most valuable product, and the anticipated AI-driven growth hasn't yet materialized.  The consistent prediction from multiple models in previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  This consensus, alongside the relatively small revenue growth and the significant shortfall in iPhone sales, strengthens the prediction of a fall.  However, Apple's strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and long-term potential in AI could limit the extent of any decline.  The previous rounds show a consistent shift toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall, with most models predicting a fall probability between 0.6 and 0.7. I take this consensus into account and offer a prediction that considers the overall picture while accounting for the strong brand and future potential of the company.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with a slight decline in iPhone sales missing analyst expectations, while total revenue increased by almost 4%. The iPhone is Apple's most important product, and the miss on sales projections, coupled with the lack of immediate AI-driven growth, may negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. However, the overall revenue growth and Apple's strong financial health provide some positive signals. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 in earlier rounds, and gradually adjusting to slightly lower probabilities (0.58-0.65) as mitigating factors like revenue growth and future AI potential are considered. Given this trend and the mixed nature of the news, the probability of the stock price falling remains slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but the extent of the decline may be limited by Apple's overall resilience.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations. While the total revenue increased by almost 4% year-over-year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, may be perceived negatively by investors. The market was likely expecting more significant growth driven by artificial intelligence (AI) software. Given that the news did not meet investor expectations regarding iPhone sales and the AI-driven growth, it is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the anticipation of future AI advancements could limit the extent of the decline. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these factors, and the mixed signals from the report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.36, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.64, Reasoning: The news about Apple's slight decline in iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment, especially given the importance of the iPhone as a key revenue driver. Although total revenue showed a modest increase, the miss on iPhone sales and the absence of anticipated AI-driven growth could overshadow this positive aspect. Considering the mixed signals from the news and the consensus from previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a minor decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product.
