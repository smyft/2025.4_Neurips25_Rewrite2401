(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The decrease in iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver for Apple, indicates potential challenges in meeting investor expectations. Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales relative to analyst projections can create negative sentiment among investors, leading to potential downward pressure on the stock price. As a result, there is a greater likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising, especially as investors are awaiting a payoff from AI initiatives that have yet to materialize.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2023 earnings showed a slight miss on iPhone sales, falling short of analyst expectations. While overall revenue showed a modest increase, the decline in iPhone sales, its most valuable product, is a concern. The news highlights the market's anticipation of an AI-driven growth spurt that hasn't yet materialized.  Investors are likely to react negatively to the missed expectations in the short term, potentially causing a price drop. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the anticipation of future AI advancements could limit the extent of the decline.  The long-term outlook for Apple remains positive due to its strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and potential for AI integration. Therefore, the probability of a price fall immediately following this news is considered higher than a price rise, but the fall is expected to be limited and potentially followed by a recovery as investors reassess the AI potential.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone sales fell slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the company's total revenue still rose by almost 4% year-over-year, suggesting some resilience. The mention of AI as a potential future growth driver may mitigate some negative reactions, but the immediate miss on iPhone sales is likely to weigh more heavily on the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's iPhone sales have declined slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst projections. Although the total revenue increased by almost 4% from the same quarter last year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, may be perceived negatively by investors. The market was likely expecting more significant growth driven by artificial intelligence (AI) software. Given that the news did not meet investor expectations regarding iPhone sales and the AI-driven growth, it is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price. However, the overall revenue increase and the company's ability to maintain growth could mitigate the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales for Apple, which is a key product and significant revenue source for the company. This decline, although small, misses analyst projections and might indicate that the anticipated growth from artificial-intelligence software has not yet materialized. However, Apple's total revenue still saw an increase, suggesting that other segments of the company's business are performing well. Considering these factors, the news has both positive and negative aspects for investors. The slight decline in iPhone sales and the miss on projections could lead to a negative reaction, but the overall revenue growth might mitigate this effect. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising due to this mixed news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's reported slight decline in iPhone sales in the December quarter falls short of analyst expectations and signals that the anticipated impact from AI software on their key product isn't materializing yet. Such underperformance in a core segment could dampen investor sentiment, particularly given high market expectations of Apple. However, the overall revenue growth, albeit modest, indicates the company isn't struggling and remains financially robust. This mixed signal suggests a cautious market reaction where a slight dip is more probable than a strong surge, but substantial volatility is likely.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
