A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This could negatively impact Apple's market share and revenue projections in a significant market, leading to investor concerns about future growth. As a result, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative development for Apple: losing market share in China, a crucial market for the company. The fact that local competitors, Vivo and Huawei, have surpassed Apple in sales suggests increased competition and potentially weakening brand appeal or pricing issues. This loss of market share directly impacts revenue projections and investor sentiment, likely leading to a decrease in stock price. While Apple is a large, diversified company, a significant setback in a key market like China is a cause for concern.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market to Vivo and Huawei.  China is a significant market for Apple, and this loss of market share is negative news. However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance might be limited, as China represents only a portion of Apple's global sales.  Furthermore, Apple's revenue is diversified across various product lines (iPads, Macs, services, etc.), reducing the impact of a single market's decline.  While the news is negative, the overall effect on the stock price is likely to be muted due to the diversification of Apple's business.  A small price drop is possible, but a significant fall is less likely given Apple's overall financial strength and the limited information available in the headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its leading position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. China is a critical market for Apple, and losing market share there could negatively impact its revenue and growth prospects. Investors may react to this news by selling Apple stock, leading to a potential decline in its price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local companies Vivo and Huawei. This development suggests a potential decline in Apple's sales and market share in a significant market, which could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, investors may view this news as unfavorable for Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This loss of market share in a significant market like China could negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in this information or that Apple's global brand and diverse product lineup could mitigate the impact of this news, leading to a lesser effect on the stock price than might be expected.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple Inc.'s loss of the smartphone crown in China to local brands Vivo and Huawei suggests a decline in market share and potential revenue loss in a significant market. This could negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a probable decrease in stock price. However, Apple's overall performance is influenced by multiple factors, including its services segment and other international markets.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its leading position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This is a significant development as China is a crucial market for Apple, and losing market share could negatively impact revenue and growth prospects. The previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news, reflecting concerns about market share and investor sentiment. While Apple's diversified product portfolio may mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall sentiment remains bearish given the importance of the Chinese market. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds, highlighting Apple's loss of market share in China to Vivo and Huawei, strongly suggests a downward pressure on the stock price. China is a crucial market, and losing the top spot is a significant setback. While Apple has a diversified business, this news is likely to negatively impact investor confidence. Considering the previous predictions and the importance of the Chinese market, I'm maintaining a high probability of the stock price falling, but slightly adjusting it upwards to account for potential market resilience and Apple's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news that Apple has lost its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market to Vivo and Huawei is undeniably negative.  China is a significant market for Apple, and this loss of market share could impact revenue. However, the previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall but not a drastic one.  The consensus seems to acknowledge that Apple's diversification across products and services will likely mitigate the impact of this single negative event.  The lack of detail in the news article (due to the paywall) prevents a more precise assessment. Considering the previous predictions and the inherent resilience of Apple's business model, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledging the possibility of a muted reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant loss of market share for Apple in China, a critical market for the company. This development is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, as it suggests potential declines in revenue and growth prospects. While Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative effects, the overall impact is expected to be negative. Previous predictions also largely favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, aligning with this analysis.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This development suggests a potential decline in Apple's sales and market share in a significant market, which could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability. As a result, investors may view this news as unfavorable for Apple's stock price, leading to a higher probability of a decline. However, considering Apple's diversified product portfolio and global presence, the impact on its stock price may be limited. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei.

However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty might mitigate some of the negative impact. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs and the fact that the news is negative but not catastrophic, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than that of it rising, but not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has lost its leading position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. Given China's significance as a market for Apple, this news is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and could lead to a decline in Apple's stock price. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong global presence could partially offset the impact of this news. Previous predictions from various models suggest a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its leading position in the Chinese smartphone market to local competitors Vivo and Huawei, which is a significant setback given China's importance as a market for Apple. This loss of market share is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to concerns about future revenue and growth prospects. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting a bearish sentiment among analysts. While Apple's diversified product portfolio may mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall consensus remains that the stock price is more likely to decline in response to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.23, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.77, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across previous rounds, stemming from Apple's loss of market share in China to Vivo and Huawei, strongly suggests continued downward pressure on the stock price. China remains a crucial market, and losing the top spot is a significant setback. While Apple possesses a diversified business, this news is likely to negatively impact investor confidence. The consensus from previous models indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the lack of new information and the consistent negative outlook, I will maintain a similar prediction, slightly adjusting the probabilities to reflect the continued negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news that Apple lost its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market to Vivo and Huawei is undeniably negative.

The lack of detail in the news article (due to the paywall) prevents a more precise assessment.  The consistent downward trend in predictions across rounds suggests a solidifying negative sentiment, but not a complete market panic.  Considering the previous predictions and the inherent resilience of Apple's business model, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledging the possibility of a muted reaction. The slight increase in the probability of a price rise in round 1 from some models suggests a potential for some market resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China to local competitors Vivo and Huawei.
