(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today\nNews Content: Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple by two analysts, along with disappointing iPhone sales figures, suggests a negative sentiment surrounding the stock. The potential decline in iPhone shipments, particularly in China, and concerns about Apple's ability to capitalize on AI advancements further contribute to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two analysts downgraded Apple due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. The article highlights weak consumer demand, competition from domestic rivals, and uncertainty about the impact of Apple Intelligence. While Loop Capital remains optimistic about long-term growth, the immediate outlook is weak. The high valuation of Apple, coupled with single-digit growth and China-related risks, suggests limited upside potential. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't directly counter the negative news. Given these factors, the probability of a further stock price fall is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock price. Two analysts downgraded Apple, citing disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China.  Concerns about the impact of the Chinese economic slowdown and the uncertain success of Apple's AI initiatives further contribute to a pessimistic outlook. While the article mentions potential future growth, the immediate concerns outweigh the long-term prospects in the short term. The current valuation of Apple also leaves little room for error.  The 4.1% drop on the day of the news release further supports the negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than the probability of a rise in the immediate future.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights two significant downgrades from Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, due to disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China. The analysts also expressed concerns about the delayed impact of Apple Intelligence and the company's high valuation. These factors suggest negative sentiment around Apple's near-term performance and growth prospects. Given the downgrades and the cited challenges, the market is likely to react negatively in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales and potential weak guidance for the March quarter. The downgrades and lowered price targets suggest a negative outlook for Apple's stock in the short term. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will continue to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter. The downgrades were primarily driven by weak sales in China and concerns about Apple's ability to execute on AI. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will continue to fall in the short term. However, the article also mentions that Apple has a huge, sticky customer base and potential long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, which could lead to a rebound in the stock price. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling as higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates multiple downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. The negative outlook from analysts and the potential delay in the AI-driven upgrade cycle could continue to impact investor sentiment negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
