(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses common investing mistakes and reflects on the author's experience with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges the company's strong brand and historical performance, they also highlight potential complacency and the need for ongoing diligence. The overall tone suggests a cautious optimism about Apple's future, but it also recognizes the competitive landscape and the importance of adapting investment theses. Given this context, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are influenced by the author's mixed sentiments about complacency and market competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strengths, they also point out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that the company faces headwinds. This suggests a more cautious outlook on Apple's future performance. The article doesn't explicitly recommend selling Apple, but it does imply that the stock might not be the high-growth opportunity it once was. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically relate to Apple's current situation. Overall, the article presents a neutral to slightly negative sentiment towards Apple, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, one of which involves Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and history but points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that complacency in holding the stock is a mistake.  However, the author doesn't suggest selling Apple, only that more diligence is needed.  The overall tone is not overtly bearish, but rather cautionary.  The mention of slower growth compared to other companies and the need for increased diligence suggests a slightly higher probability of a price stagnation or minor decline than a significant rise, but the impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be minimal given Apple's overall market position and the relatively mild nature of the critique.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news content discusses subtle investing mistakes, including complacency with Apple's stock. The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and growth but points out that its performance may not meet inflated expectations due to market saturation and competition. This introspective analysis suggests a more cautious view on Apple's future performance, which could influence investor sentiment negatively. However, the overall tone is not alarmist, and Apple remains a favorable investment in the author's view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite Apple's strong brand and past performance, there are signs of potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative or positive news about Apple's future performance but rather serves as a general investment insight. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards stability rather than significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a company where the author was complacent, assuming the company's success would continue forever. However, the article notes that Apple's performance, while impressive, has not been exceptional compared to other companies. The author plans to do more diligence on Apple to avoid complacency. The article does not contain any significant negative news about Apple, but rather serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of ongoing research and analysis. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, as the article does not provide any new, significant information that would impact Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the article is not focused on any immediate negative news concerning Apple but rather serves as a general warning against investment complacency. This reflection is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly in the near term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article reflects on the author's past investing mistakes, particularly regarding complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance, it also highlights concerns about slowing growth relative to competitors and the need for ongoing diligence. The overall sentiment is cautious, suggesting that while Apple remains a favorable investment, there are headwinds that could impact its future performance. This leads to a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price decline due to the caution expressed in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, ecosystem), it also highlights potential headwinds (slower growth, market saturation) and the author's past complacency. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a generic call to action and doesn't specifically endorse Apple. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a slight bearish sentiment. I will adjust the probabilities to reflect this, but not drastically, as the article isn't overtly negative. The fact that the author still considers Apple a favorable investment mitigates the negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example to illustrate the risk of complacency.  The author acknowledges Apple's strengths but highlights slower growth compared to peers and the need for continued diligence.  This is not negative news about Apple's fundamentals, but rather a cautionary tale about investor behavior.  The article lacks any specific negative information that would likely cause a significant stock price drop. While the author's reflection on complacency might slightly reduce overly optimistic investor sentiment, it's unlikely to trigger a major sell-off. Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.4 to 0.55 for a price rise and 0.3 to 0.6 for a price fall, and the overall neutral-to-slightly-cautious tone of the article, a relatively balanced probability is most appropriate. The article is unlikely to significantly move the stock price in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reflects on the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with Apple's stock. While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance, they also highlight potential slowdowns in growth and market saturation. The tone is cautionary rather than overtly negative, suggesting a need for more diligence rather than a sell-off. Given the mixed sentiment and the lack of immediate negative catalysts, the stock price is likely to remain stable with a slight bias towards a potential rise due to Apple's overall strong market position and brand value.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency with Apple's stock.

This isn't negative news about Apple's fundamentals but a cautionary tale about investor behavior. The article lacks specific negative information likely to cause a significant stock price drop.

The article is unlikely to significantly move the stock price in either direction. The slight downward bias in several previous predictions is likely due to the emphasis on the need for more diligence and the acknowledgement of slower growth, but this is not a strong enough signal to predict a significant fall.  Therefore, I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting the overall strength of Apple and the lack of truly negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reflects on the author's personal investing mistakes, including complacency with Apple's stock.
