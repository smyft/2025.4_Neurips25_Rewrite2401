A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to a sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised competition fears among major players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. With Apple set to report earnings soon, the market is likely being influenced by the broader volatility created by DeepSeek's revelations. Additionally, any potential weakness in earnings or guidance from Apple could lead to negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is elevated. Given these considerations, despite the anticipation around Apple\u2019s earnings, the overall sentiment leaning towards risk aversion may weigh heavily, hence the probability of stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Several articles highlight the competitive threat posed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has caused broader market concerns and even a tech stock sell-off, initially a negative signal. However, Nvidia has suggested that DeepSeek will need more of Nvidia's chips, suggesting that DeepSeek's advancement is real but not detrimental to chip leaders. Meta's success indicates market appetite for AI spends. Apple is gearing up to release its fiscal first quarter results. These earnings generate uncertainty until actually released. Considering the rise of AI development (as seen with Deepseek, Meta, and others), the possibility of positive announcements from Apple is present, as they have likely built some AI strategies of their own. Given the information available, a slightly higher chance of a positive (or no) movement is indicated by the recent events. However, the market is uncertain and dependent on what actually turns out for Apple. Therefore, a slight increase is expected, if anything.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its impact on the tech sector.  The article mentions DeepSeek's competitive AI model causing a significant sell-off in tech stocks, including Nvidia's record-setting loss. While Apple's earnings are upcoming, the overall negative sentiment surrounding the AI landscape due to DeepSeek and the related anxieties about competition and potential national security concerns, create a cloud over the market.  While Apple's performance is not directly linked to DeepSeek, the prevailing market sentiment suggests increased risk aversion.  Considering this broader negative market sentiment, and the lack of positive news directly related to Apple, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.  The upcoming earnings announcement however might influence the stock price independently, but the overall context suggests a higher likelihood of negative price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad sell-off in tech stocks triggered by developments around Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of upcoming earnings, the direct impact of the news on Apple is not explicitly detailed. However, given the broader tech sell-off and investor caution around AI competition, there may be negative sentiment affecting AAPL. Additionally, Apple's earnings announcement is pending, which could lead to volatility. The lack of positive catalysts in the news suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook for AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the global tech stock market. It mentions that DeepSeek caused a sell-off in tech stocks, including a significant loss for Nvidia. However, the focus shifts to Apple's upcoming earnings report. Given that Microsoft and Meta have already reported their earnings with mixed results, Apple's stock might experience volatility. The overall sentiment seems cautious, but Apple's strong brand and diverse product lineup could mitigate negative impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on the tech industry, including a global tech stock sell-off that affected companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. However, the article also mentions that Apple's earnings are expected to be released, and the company's performance may not be directly affected by DeepSeek's AI advancements. Given the mixed signals in the article, with some companies experiencing losses and others gaining, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is uncertain. However, considering the overall negative sentiment towards Big Tech due to DeepSeek's emergence, the probability of Apple's stock price falling might be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's AI model affecting the tech sector generally may create negative sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. However, Apple's strong financial position and upcoming earnings could counterbalance these broader market sentiments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to the sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. This has caused a negative sentiment in the market, particularly impacting large players like Apple. While Apple has its earnings report upcoming, the broader negative market sentiment surrounding AI competition and the tech sector raises risk aversion. Many previous predictions suggest a prevalence of negative sentiment influenced by DeepSeek, with most analysts leaning towards a higher probability of a price drop for Apple stocks. Although there are mixed signals regarding Apple\u2019s own performance and potential resilience, the overarching nervousness in the tech sector suggests elevated risks. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news paints a mixed picture. The emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on the AI landscape initially sparked a tech stock sell-off, negatively impacting Nvidia and creating broader anxieties about competition. This could weigh on Apple's stock. However, the news also highlights Meta's positive performance after earnings, driven by AI investments and indicating market appetite for AI development. Moreover, Apple's earnings are due, presenting the potential for positive surprises. Considering the previous round of predictions shows differing opinions and a slight lean towards stock price falling, the effect of DeepSeek and uncertainty may be diminishing. The increasing belief in the potential of Apple to leverage AI for growth is also present. Thus the stock movement trend has been reversed. Overall, given Apple's upcoming earnings, the potential to showcase AI strategy, plus the positive sentiment around AI demonstrated by Meta, the likelihood of a rise is present. However the market will be uncertain about the stock until the earnings is released. Therefore a conservative rise is expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for Apple. The DeepSeek-induced sell-off in tech stocks creates a generally negative market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of a price drop for Apple even before considering its own earnings report.  However, Apple's strong brand, diverse product line, and the upcoming earnings announcement introduce significant uncertainty.  Positive earnings could easily offset the negative market sentiment.  The previous predictions range widely, suggesting substantial uncertainty in the market's reaction.  Considering the prevailing negative sentiment amplified by the DeepSeek story and the uncertainty around Apple's earnings, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledge the considerable chance of a price rise or even no significant movement depending on the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised competitive concerns and investor caution. While Apple's upcoming earnings report introduces uncertainty, the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector, especially around AI competition, could weigh on Apple's stock. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams may provide some resilience. Given the mixed signals in the news and the lack of direct positive catalysts for Apple, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to a sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report could potentially offset some of the negative sentiment if the results are strong. Given the broader market volatility and competition fears raised by DeepSeek, there is a cautious outlook towards tech stocks, including Apple. The mixed results from other tech companies like Microsoft and Meta also suggest that Apple's stock price could experience volatility. However, considering Apple's strong brand and the potential for positive earnings surprises, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than but close to that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has caused a global tech stock sell-off. While Apple's upcoming earnings report could introduce volatility, the company's strong brand and diverse product lineup may mitigate negative impacts. Considering the overall negative sentiment towards Big Tech due to DeepSeek's emergence and the mixed results from other tech companies like Microsoft and Meta, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is uncertain. However, the anticipation around Apple's earnings and the potential for positive announcements could slightly offset the negative sentiment, leading to a relatively balanced probability assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant disruptions in the tech sector due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. This has led to considerable stock movements, especially negative ones for major tech companies such as Nvidia and potential spillover effects on others like Microsoft and Meta. Although the news primarily centers around DeepSeek's impact, the mixed reactions from other companies suggest a cautious market sentiment towards AI advancements and competition. Apple is set to release its earnings, adding another layer of uncertainty, as the market awaits more specific updates about their financial performance and strategy in regard to AI. Given these points and considering the previously provided predictions, the overall sentiment appears somewhat pessimistic.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has created significant turmoil in the tech sector, leading to a widespread stock sell-off, which is likely to impact Apple negatively as investors may exhibit risk aversion ahead of their earnings report. Although there is potential for positive earnings surprises, the prevailing sentiment surrounding AI competition and the broader tech market\u2019s volatility introduces substantial uncertainty. Most predictions indicate a higher probability of stock price decline due to these factors, despite Apple's strong brand and some analysts highlighting the possibility of growth. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek on the tech market, creating an overall negative sentiment. Apple's earnings report is the key event, but the external market conditions create risk. Round 0 shows a lean towards 'fall', with predictions ranging from 0.3 to 0.55 for a rise. Round 1 sees some models adjusting upward (Gemini 2.0-flash-001 leaning towards a rise to 0.6), while others remain bearish. There's an expectation that Apple might navigate the AI competition with positive earnings, but this is not assured. Combining the negative external environment with uncertainty regarding Apple's AI strategy suggests that a cautious perspective is warranted. The slightly higher bearish sentiment (lower prediction of rising stock price in previous turn) may indicates that there are some other potential negative information about Apple's stock price that other predictors may know. Hence, the chance of the stock price falling remains higher than rising, slightly lower than the last round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The DeepSeek-induced sell-off in tech stocks creates a generally negative market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of a price drop.  This is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report.  However, Apple's strong brand, diverse product line, and potential for positive surprises in its earnings announcement introduce significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from a strong belief in a price drop to a modest belief in a price increase, indicating uncertain market sentiment.  Considering the prevailing negative sentiment amplified by the DeepSeek story, the potential for negative earnings, and the overall uncertainty in the market, I assign a slightly greater probability to a price fall. However, the possibility of a price rise or even no significant change cannot be ignored, especially if Apple's earnings meet or exceed expectations. The range of previous predictions emphasizes that this situation is not easily predicted; the probability is tilted towards negative movement, but it remains relatively close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised competitive concerns and investor caution. While Apple's upcoming earnings report introduces uncertainty, the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector, especially around AI competition, could weigh on Apple's stock. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams may provide some resilience. Given the mixed signals in the news and the lack of direct positive catalysts for Apple, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to the sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.

This has led to considerable stock movements, especially negative ones for major tech companies. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report introduces uncertainty and the potential for positive surprises. Considering the overall negative sentiment towards Big Tech due to DeepSeek's emergence and the mixed results from other tech companies, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is uncertain.

This has significantly impacted companies such as Nvidia and has created concerns across the entire tech sector. Apple, as part of this sector, faces a similar risk. However, the upcoming earnings report for Apple adds an element of uncertainty because it could provide positive news that might counterbalance the negative sentiment. The various predictions from previous rounds suggest mixed sentiments, with a slight lean towards predicting a stock price fall. However, Apple's strong brand and potential earnings surprises provide some resilience against the broader negative sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
