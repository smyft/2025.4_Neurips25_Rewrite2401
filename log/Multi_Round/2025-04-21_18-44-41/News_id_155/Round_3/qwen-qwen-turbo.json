(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What Analysts Expect from Apple's Q1 2025 Earnings Report\nNews Content: The release of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) Fiscal First Quarter 2025 results is anticipated to draw market players' attention, with the global market conditions taking a toll on the sector. Apple is expected to post revenue of $124 billion this quarter, a nice 3% year-over-year increase. EPS is expected to rise from $1.47 in the previous quarter to $2.35.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with OONEF.\n\nTo a large extent, Apple's stock relies on the emergent performance of its core iPhone lineup, which brings in a large chunk of the company's revenue. Red flags are going up for analysts regarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge. Under its services segment, which includes the App Store and subscription offers, the company, too, is focusing on slower growth compared to its previous quarters on account of regulatory pressures.\n\nInvestors will look to hear commentary on the Vision Pro headset and its broader product roadmap to get a better-educated sense of whether Apple's innovation can sustain future growth. The report also is expected to feature heavily on share buybacks and capital returns to investors.\n\nApple Shares are down about 14% from their 2024 high, and the upcoming earnings call could set the stage for how Apple's stock moves in 2025. The key risks are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. is expected to show a modest revenue increase and a significant rise in EPS, which could be positive for the stock. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment, along with external macroeconomic pressures, create uncertainty. The stock has already seen a decline of 14% from its 2024 high, indicating potential bearish sentiment. Overall, while there are positive indicators, the risks and current market conditions suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q1 2025 earnings. While revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and overall global market conditions. The success of the Vision Pro and future product roadmap are crucial for sustaining growth, and the report is expected to highlight share buybacks. The stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, indicating existing market concerns. The key risks identified are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, as the market may react negatively to the concerns surrounding iPhone sales and services growth, unless the Vision Pro commentary is exceptionally positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and the overall impact of global market conditions.  The success of the Vision Pro headset and the company's broader product roadmap are crucial for future growth, and investor reaction to these factors will heavily influence the stock price.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates existing market uncertainty.  Given the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely due to the uncertainty surrounding the new product and the macro environment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, revenue is expected to grow by 3% year-over-year to $124 billion, and EPS is projected to rise significantly from $1.47 to $2.35. This could indicate strong profitability and may boost investor confidence. Additionally, the focus on share buybacks and capital returns could be viewed favorably by the market. However, there are notable concerns: iPhone sales are showing signs of plateauing, which is critical as it drives a large portion of Apple's revenue. The services segment is also experiencing slower growth due to regulatory pressures, and the stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high. The market will likely weigh these factors, with particular attention to the Vision Pro headset and future innovation commentary. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a negative reaction due to the heightened risks and existing downward trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, highlighting expectations of a 3% year-over-year revenue increase to $124 billion and an EPS rise to $2.35. However, concerns are raised about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. Despite a 14% decline from its 2024 high, the stock's future movement hinges on the earnings call's commentary on product innovation, particularly the Vision Pro headset, and capital returns to investors. The key risks mentioned are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities. Given the mixed expectations and risks, there's a cautious outlook but with a slightly positive bias due to the anticipated revenue and EPS growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, which is expected to show a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about iPhone sales volumes and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that Apple's stock is down 14% from its 2024 high, and the earnings call could set the stage for the stock's movement in 2025. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the concerns about iPhone sales and regulatory pressures may outweigh the expected revenue and EPS growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected revenue growth of 3% and an increase in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35 suggest positive indicators. However, there are concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. Additionally, the stock has already declined by 14% from its peak, which might indicate some pessimism among investors. The Vision Pro headset and share buybacks may provide some positive sentiment but are not yet proven to drive substantial growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report for Apple Inc. presents a mixed outlook. While a 3% year-over-year revenue increase and a significant rise in EPS are positive indicators, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures create uncertainty. The stock has already declined by 14% from its 2024 high, indicating existing market pessimism. The market's reaction will heavily depend on commentary regarding the Vision Pro headset and future product innovation. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise, reflecting the cautious sentiment among analysts and investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The consensus from previous predictions leans towards a slightly negative outlook, primarily due to concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment. While the expected revenue and EPS growth are positive, the market seems to be more focused on the potential downsides. The stock's 14% decline from its 2024 high further reinforces this bearish sentiment. The success of Vision Pro is uncertain, and regulatory pressures add to the concerns. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the inherent risks, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive aspects include projected revenue and EPS growth. However, significant concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower services segment growth due to regulatory pressures, and general macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro is crucial, and its impact is uncertain. The 14% drop from the 2024 high reflects existing market pessimism.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning slightly bearish. Considering the balanced but slightly negative sentiment from the news and the previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the potential for a positive surprise from the Vision Pro or strong buyback announcements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, the expected revenue growth of 3% and a significant rise in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35 could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, the focus on share buybacks and capital returns may be viewed favorably. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and the stock's 14% decline from its 2024 high introduce significant risks. The market's reaction will likely hinge on the earnings call's commentary on the Vision Pro headset and future innovation. Given the mixed signals and existing downward trend, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but neither is overwhelmingly likely due to the uncertainty surrounding new products and the macro environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report.

Considering the mixed signals and the cautious outlook from previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.

Previous predictions consistently show a slightly bearish bias, with probabilities of a price fall generally exceeding those of a price rise.  Considering the balanced but slightly negative sentiment from the news and the consistent bearish trend in previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall. The potential for a positive surprise from the Vision Pro or strong buyback announcements exists, but the overall risk profile leans towards a negative market reaction unless the earnings call significantly addresses the concerns regarding iPhone sales and services growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed outlook.
