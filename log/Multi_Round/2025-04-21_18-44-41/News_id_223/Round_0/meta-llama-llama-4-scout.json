(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\nNews Content: https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/barclays-price-target-raised-to-350-gbp-from-320-gbp-at-deutsche-bank\n\nDeutsche Bank raised the firm\u2019s price target on Barclays (BCS) to 350 GBp from 320 GBp and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Even if you give Barclays no credit for the least predictable parts of their strategy, the shares offer significant value, the firm told investors in a research note on Friday. Barclays trades at an implied cost of equity of 18%. There is clearly embedded skepticism in the valuation which Deutsche attributes to two primary factors, namely the plan to take market share in the investment bank on the same capital base, and growth in the U.S. consumer business but at much wider margins.\n\nInvest with Confidence:\n\nFollow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.

(AAPL). The article mentions that Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Barclays (BCS) to 350 GBp from 320 GBp, which is a positive sentiment towards Barclays, not Apple. Therefore, this news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Barclays\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"BCS\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```\n\nNote that the news is actually about Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL), so I assume there was a mistake in providing the news about Apple but actually referring to Barclays. \n\nIn this case, I estimate that there is a 70% chance that the stock price of Barclays (BCS) will rise and a 30% chance that it will fall due to the raised price target by analysts at Deutsche Bank. \n\nHowever, if we were to mistakenly assume that this news is about Apple (AAPL), I would estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news is not related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and seems to be about Barclays (BCS) receiving a raised price target from Deutsche Bank. Therefore, it is unlikely to have any impact on Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"No relevant news provided for AAPL\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
