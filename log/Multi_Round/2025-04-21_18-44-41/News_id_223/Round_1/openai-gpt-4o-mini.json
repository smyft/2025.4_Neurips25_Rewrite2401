(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\nNews Content: https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/barclays-price-target-raised-to-350-gbp-from-320-gbp-at-deutsche-bank\n\nDeutsche Bank raised the firm\u2019s price target on Barclays (BCS) to 350 GBp from 320 GBp and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Even if you give Barclays no credit for the least predictable parts of their strategy, the shares offer significant value, the firm told investors in a research note on Friday. Barclays trades at an implied cost of equity of 18%. There is clearly embedded skepticism in the valuation which Deutsche attributes to two primary factors, namely the plan to take market share in the investment bank on the same capital base, and growth in the U.S. consumer business but at much wider margins.\n\nInvest with Confidence:\n\nFollow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Barclays' price target being raised, which is a positive indicator for Barclays itself, not Apple Inc. However, the mention of Apple in the context of Barclays' credit card partnership suggests that any positive sentiment towards Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple. Given that the news does not directly impact Apple's fundamentals and is more focused on Barclays, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism rather than a strong bullish sentiment for Apple. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be moderate, while the probability of it falling is lower due to the lack of negative news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL). The article discusses Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays. While the article mentions Apple in the context of Barclays potentially taking over the Goldman Sachs credit card partnership, this is indirect and doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price in a significant way based solely on this news. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, but not enough to warrant a high probability of a significant rise. The news is more relevant to Barclays than Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Apple in relation to Barclays' potential credit card partnership, the price target change for Barclays has no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving up or down due to this news is extremely low, primarily influenced by other market factors and not this specific news item.  Any movement would be coincidental.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily discuss Barclays (BCS) and its price target upgrade by Deutsche Bank, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the news mentions Apple in the context of a potential credit card partnership with Barclays, this is a secondary detail and not the main focus. The direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price is minimal, as it does not provide any significant new information about Apple's financial performance or strategic direction. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Barclays' price target being raised by Deutsche Bank, indicating a positive outlook for the company. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of exploring a potential credit card partnership with Barclays, which could be seen as a neutral or slightly positive development for Apple. Given that the primary focus of the article is on Barclays and not Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the mention of Apple in a positive business development context could slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.95, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Deutsche Bank raising the price target for Barclays PLC (BCS), but it mistakenly refers to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. However, positive news about any company in the financial sector can indirectly influence investor sentiment and market conditions. Therefore, there might be a slight positive effect, but it is minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
