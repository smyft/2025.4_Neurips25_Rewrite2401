(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it prepares to report earnings. While U.S. stock futures are generally higher, suggesting a positive market sentiment, Apple faces challenges such as increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to its AI initiatives. Analysts expect tepid revenue growth, which could weigh on the stock. However, Apple's relatively lower exposure to the AI spending concerns compared to peers may provide some support. Overall, the mixed signals lead to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors influencing Apple's stock price. Positive factors include the overall positive sentiment in the market indicated by higher futures, and Apple's relatively lower exposure to the AI spending concerns compared to other Big Tech companies. Baird analysts suggest Apple is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without massive spending. However, negative factors are also present. The news mentions tepid quarterly revenue growth expectations, intensifying competition in the Chinese market, and mixed-to-poor reviews for Apple Intelligence, potentially not driving iPhone sales significantly. The Fed's wait-and-see approach to rate cuts could also dampen enthusiasm. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than a fall, reflecting the concerns about revenue growth and AI reception.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is positive, with futures pointing upwards.  However, the news regarding Apple is mixed. While the broader tech sector is showing some resilience in the face of concerns about AI spending (Microsoft and Meta's responses to the DeepSeek model), Apple's own AI initiatives have received mixed reviews, potentially impacting iPhone sales.  The tepid revenue growth forecast also casts a shadow.  The Fed's decision to hold rates steady could be seen as slightly positive, reducing uncertainty, but it's not a major factor specifically impacting Apple.  Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, but both probabilities are relatively close to 0.5, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed environment for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is less exposed to the competitive pressures from DeepSeek's low-cost AI model compared to its Big Tech peers, and it is positioned to benefit from generative AI without massive spending. However, Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in China and mixed reviews for its AI-enhanced features. The overall market sentiment is slightly positive with futures higher, but tech earnings and Fed decisions add uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for tech stocks, with some companies like Meta Platforms seeing better-than-expected revenue, while others like Microsoft faced disappointment due to tepid outlooks for their cloud computing units. Apple's upcoming earnings report is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth, which could be influenced by intensifying competition in its Chinese market and lukewarm reception to its AI offerings. However, Apple is considered less exposed to the AI spending concerns compared to its peers. Given the overall positive movement in U.S. stock futures and the wait-and-see approach by the Fed, there seems to be a cautiously optimistic sentiment. But, specific challenges faced by Apple, such as competition in China and mixed reviews of its AI features, might cap the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall positive trend in the tech industry, with many big tech companies, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, reporting their quarterly earnings. Despite concerns over the emergence of a low-cost AI model from a Chinese start-up, executives from these companies have defended their AI spending plans. Apple, which is due to report its quarterly earnings, is expected to unveil tepid revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the risks associated with the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers, and its relatively modest capital expenditures on AI could be seen as a positive. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and its wait-and-see approach to future policy moves may also have a positive impact on the stock market. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including AI spending, cost-cutting measures, and the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. For Apple specifically, there is mention of potential tepid revenue growth and mixed reviews on AI features, which might impact investor sentiment negatively. However, it is noted that Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers. Overall, the tech sector seems to be recovering slightly with futures higher, but specific concerns for Apple may temper this positive trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it prepares to report earnings. While U.S. stock futures are generally higher, indicating positive market sentiment, Apple faces challenges such as increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to its AI initiatives. Analysts expect tepid revenue growth, which could weigh on the stock. However, Apple's relatively lower exposure to AI spending concerns compared to peers may provide some support. The overall sentiment in the tech sector is cautiously optimistic, but specific challenges for Apple temper this outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a price fall due to these concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall market sentiment is positive with higher futures, Apple faces specific challenges. These include expected tepid revenue growth due to competition in China and mixed reviews for its AI initiatives. However, Apple's lower exposure to AI spending concerns compared to peers is a positive. The previous predictions are varied, with some leaning towards a fall and others towards a rise, indicating uncertainty. Considering the negative factors related to revenue and AI reception, but also the positive market sentiment and Apple's relative strength in AI spending, I'm slightly leaning towards a fall, but not as strongly as some previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include higher US stock futures, suggesting overall market optimism, and Apple's relatively lower exposure to the risks associated with massive AI investments compared to its peers.  Analysts at Baird highlight Apple's strong position to benefit from generative AI without significant capital expenditure. However, negative factors outweigh these positives.  Tepid revenue growth expectations, intensified competition in China, and mixed reviews for Apple's AI initiatives are significant concerns. The Fed's wait-and-see approach on interest rates provides little directional guidance for Apple specifically.  Considering the preponderance of negative factors and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, the probability of a price fall is judged to be higher than a price rise.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, which aligns with my assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the overall market sentiment is positive with U.S. stock futures ticking higher, and Apple is less exposed to the AI spending concerns that are affecting other Big Tech companies. Additionally, Apple's relatively modest capital expenditures on AI compared to peers could be seen as a positive. However, Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth due to intensifying competition in China and mixed-to-poor reviews for its AI-enhanced features. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady adds some stability but doesn't significantly impact Apple's outlook.
