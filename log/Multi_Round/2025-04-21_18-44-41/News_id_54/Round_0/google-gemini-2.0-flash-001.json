While the headline mentions two leading AI stocks, it doesn't explicitly name Apple. However, Apple is widely considered a major player in the technology sector and is actively investing in AI. The implication is that Apple *could* be one of the companies Berkshire Hathaway is invested in, or at least benefit from the overall AI trend that Berkshire is betting on. Warren Buffett's investment decisions are generally viewed positively by the market, so this news is likely to create positive sentiment around companies involved in AI. Therefore, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the news is somewhat vague and doesn't directly confirm Berkshire's investment in Apple, which limits the potential positive impact. Also, the market's overall condition and other company-specific news will also influence the stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett Has $74 Billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $301 Billion Portfolio Tied Up in 2 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
