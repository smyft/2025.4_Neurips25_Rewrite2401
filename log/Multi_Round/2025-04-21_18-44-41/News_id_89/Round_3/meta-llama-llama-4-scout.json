(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been underperforming, down 8% in 2025, and analysts have shown bearish sentiment with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). While there are some positive expectations for China sales and Services revenue, the overall growth has been stagnant, and the lack of revisions in EPS suggests limited optimism. The upcoming earnings report will be critical, but the mixed signals and recent performance indicate a higher probability of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While EPS is expected to grow, top-line growth has been stagnant. China revenue has been a concern, but forecasts suggest a potential positive change. Services revenue is a strong point, consistently exceeding expectations. iPhone sales, driven by Apple Intelligence, are crucial but uncertain. The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. Overall, the negative factors (bearish analyst sentiment, past China performance, stagnant top-line growth) slightly outweigh the potential positives (Services growth, potential China recovery, Apple Intelligence impact). Therefore, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows 8% year-over-year growth and Services are expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's overall growth has cooled, China revenue has been consistently underperforming, and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects analyst bearishness.  The positive year-over-year growth forecast for China sales is a potential upside, but the overall picture is cautious.  Given the mixed signals and the existing bearish sentiment, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) financial news suggests mixed signals. On the negative side, the stock has underperformed in 2025, with an 8% decline, and the company's top and bottom line growth has been cooling. China revenue has been a concern, with five consecutive misses, though the upcoming quarter is expected to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment among analysts. On the positive side, the Services segment has been robust, with record levels and consistent outperformance, and the iPhone segment has shown recent recovery. The key factors to watch are China results, Services momentum, and the adoption of Apple Intelligence. Given the mixed signals, the stock's movement will likely depend on the actual earnings results and guidance, particularly around these key metrics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. The stock has had a rough start to 2025, down 8%, and is currently ranked #4 (Sell) by Zacks. Key metrics to watch include China's sales results, Services segment performance, and iPhone sales, particularly related to Apple Intelligence. While some metrics like Services are expected to show growth, overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, suggesting a stable but not particularly positive outlook. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's current underperformance, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling if the earnings report does not exceed expectations or provide strong guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. However, top-line revisions have been slightly more negative. The article highlights key metrics to watch, including China results, Services results, and iPhone results. Given the mixed signals and the current bearish sentiment among analysts (Zacks Rank #4), I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's earnings are anticipated with a mixed outlook. While there is expectation for growth in services and potentially positive year-over-year changes in China sales, the overall trend shows a slowdown in revenue and earnings growth. The Zacks Investment Research highlights a stagnation in top-line performance, and the company is marked with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The iPhone segment and the performance in China will be crucial factors. Although there is potential for positive surprises, especially with services and possibly China sales, the overall negative analyst sentiment and stagnation in growth remain significant concerns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's upcoming earnings report presents a mixed outlook. While there are expectations for growth in the Services segment and a potential positive change in China sales, the overall trend indicates stagnation in revenue and earnings growth. The stock has underperformed significantly in 2025, down 8%, and currently holds a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), reflecting bearish sentiment among analysts. Key metrics such as China revenue and iPhone sales will be critical in determining the stock's movement. Given the prevailing negative sentiment and the mixed signals from the earnings expectations, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While Services are expected to perform well and China sales might show positive growth, the overall growth has been stagnant, and the stock has underperformed. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. Considering these factors, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a price rise compared to the initial predictions, but still maintaining a higher probability of a price fall due to the existing negative sentiment and underperformance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to perform strongly, and China sales might show their first positive year-over-year growth in several quarters, several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's overall growth has cooled, the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain, and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects significant bearish analyst sentiment.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65.  Considering the mixed signals and the prevailing bearish sentiment, I slightly adjust the probability of a price fall upwards, reflecting the weight of negative factors and the consensus of previous predictions. The potential for positive surprises in Services and China sales is acknowledged, but the overall picture remains cautious.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial news presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, there is expected growth in EPS (8% year-over-year) and Services revenue (14% year-over-year), with potential for a positive turnaround in China sales. However, the stock has underperformed in 2025, down 8%, and the company's overall growth has been stagnant. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects bearish sentiment among analysts, and key concerns include China's performance and the uncertain impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales. Given these mixed signals and the current bearish sentiment, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial news presents a mixed outlook.

The EPS is expected to grow 8% year-over-year. Given these mixed signals, with both positive and negative factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The stock's movement will likely depend on the actual earnings results and guidance, particularly around these key metrics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial news presents a mixed outlook.

While there is cautious optimism around Services revenue and potential improvement in China sales, the overall trend shows a slowdown in revenue and earnings growth. The Zacks Investment Research highlights a stagnation in top-line performance, and the company is marked with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates bearish sentiment among analysts. The stock has underperformed in 2025, down roughly 8%, and the iPhone segment's performance and guidance on Apple Intelligence will be crucial factors. Overall, the negative sentiment and lack of strong positive catalysts suggest a slightly higher likelihood of a price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's upcoming earnings report presents a mixed outlook.

While Services and potential China recovery offer some upside, the stagnant growth, underperformance in 2025, and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) weigh heavily. Previous predictions consistently favored a price fall. I'm slightly adjusting the probabilities to reflect the continued bearish sentiment and the lack of strong positive catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include expected growth in the Services segment (14% YoY) and the potential for a positive year-over-year change in China sales for the first time in several quarters.  However, significant negative factors outweigh these positives.  Apple's overall growth has cooled, the stock has underperformed in 2025 (down 8%), and it holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating strong bearish sentiment among analysts. The success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain, and the overall top and bottom-line growth has been stagnant.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65, with a slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise in the second round. Considering the weight of negative factors, the prevailing bearish sentiment, and the consensus of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall.  While the positive aspects are noted, the overall picture remains cautious, and the risk of the stock price falling is greater than the potential for a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's financial news presents a mixed outlook.
