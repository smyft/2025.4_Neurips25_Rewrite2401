(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\nNews Content: (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity launched an agent-based assistant for Android devices on Thursday as it looks to take on larger rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and incumbent assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.\n\n\"We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,\" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.\n\nOpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.\n\nTech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.\n\nLast year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the \"coming months.\"\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity, which aims to compete with established players like Apple's Siri. While this indicates increased competition in the AI assistant space, Apple has been actively enhancing Siri and has partnerships with OpenAI, which may mitigate the impact of this new competitor. The overall sentiment around AI advancements is generally positive, and Apple's ongoing developments in this area could support its stock price. However, the introduction of a new competitor could create some uncertainty. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Perplexity's entry might pose a minor threat to Apple's Siri, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. This suggests a general trend of innovation and competition in the AI assistant space, which is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Perplexity AI's launch of an Android AI assistant, posing a potential competitive threat to Apple's Siri.  While Perplexity explicitly states its desire to launch on iOS,  the news itself doesn't directly impact Apple's financial performance.  Apple's integration of AI technologies like ChatGPT into Siri already positions them in this competitive space. The article highlights advancements from competitors like Amazon and OpenAI, but doesn't suggest a significant shift in market share or Apple's competitive standing. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Any price movement would be more likely due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity on Android, which aims to challenge existing assistants like Apple's Siri. While this introduces new competition, Apple has already integrated advanced AI capabilities into Siri through Apple Intelligence and a partnership with OpenAI. The news does not present an immediate threat to Apple's market position or its AI strategy, as Apple's ecosystem and brand strength provide a significant competitive moat. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, given the reaffirmation of Apple's ongoing AI advancements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the launch of Perplexity's AI assistant on Android, which could potentially compete with Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. However, Apple's own voice assistant, Siri, has already incorporated ChatGPT and is planning more advanced features. The introduction of Perplexity's assistant does not directly impact Apple's core business significantly, nor does it provide a substantial competitive advantage to Perplexity over Apple's existing AI integrations. The news does not directly indicate a significant threat to Apple's stock performance in the near term. Given that the news does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or product launches, it is likely to have a minimal impact on the stock price. The probability of a stock price rise or fall seems to be more aligned with neutral to slightly positive market sentiment, as advancements in AI are generally seen as beneficial for tech companies involved. However, since this news isn't directly about Apple's products or financial performance, we can assume a relatively low impact on its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the launch of Perplexity Assistant, an AI-powered assistant, on Android devices, which aims to compete with established players like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Although the article mentions Apple and its voice assistant, Siri, the news does not directly imply a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the fact that Perplexity expressed interest in making its assistant available on iOS, pending Apple's permission, could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive development for Apple, as it suggests potential future collaboration or integration opportunities. Given the competitive landscape and the ongoing advancements in AI technology, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news is estimated to be relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news describes Perplexity launching a new AI assistant for Android as competition to existing services like Siri and Alexa. This might not directly impact Apple Inc.'s stock price since it is more about competitive dynamics within the AI assistant market. However, there's a slight positive sentiment as it indicates ongoing innovation and potential for partnerships or improvements in Apple's own AI offerings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Perplexity launching an AI assistant on Android introduces increased competition in the AI assistant market, which includes Apple's Siri. However, Apple has already made significant advancements in AI integration with Siri and has partnerships with OpenAI, which mitigates the potential negative impact of this new competitor. The overall sentiment around AI advancements remains positive, and while there is some uncertainty due to competition, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards stability, with a modest chance of a price rise due to ongoing innovation in the sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The previous rounds show a consistent assessment that the news of Perplexity's AI assistant launch has a limited direct impact on Apple's stock. Most models lean towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, acknowledging the increased competition but also recognizing Apple's existing AI integrations and partnerships. The fact that Perplexity desires to be on iOS is a slightly positive signal. Given this trend and the lack of any significant new information, I will maintain a similar stance, slightly favoring a neutral to slightly positive outlook. However, considering the general market volatility and the potential for unforeseen reactions, I will adjust the probabilities slightly to reflect a bit more uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.12, Reasoning: The news about Perplexity's new AI assistant is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price.  While it represents increased competition in the AI assistant market, Apple has already integrated advanced AI features into Siri and is actively developing its AI capabilities further.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, mostly clustering around a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple.  The fact that Perplexity wants to be on iOS could even be seen as slightly positive, suggesting potential future collaboration.  Considering the overall consensus and the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.  The slight positive sentiment from some models is likely due to the ongoing advancements in AI generally being viewed favorably for tech companies.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity on Android, which aims to compete with Apple's Siri. While this introduces competition, Apple has already integrated advanced AI capabilities into Siri through Apple Intelligence and partnerships like with OpenAI. The news does not present an immediate threat to Apple's market position, and the potential for Perplexity's assistant to be available on iOS could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive development. Given the minimal direct impact on Apple's financial performance and its strong ecosystem, the stock price is likely to remain stable with a slight inclination towards positive sentiment due to the reaffirmation of Apple's AI advancements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the launch of Perplexity's AI assistant on Android, which aims to compete with Apple's Siri and other established players. However, Apple has already been enhancing Siri with Apple Intelligence and has a partnership with OpenAI for ChatGPT integration. This suggests that Apple is well-positioned in the AI assistant market, and Perplexity's entry, while potentially competitive, does not directly threaten Apple's market position or financial performance. The news is more reflective of the broader industry trend in AI advancements rather than a specific catalyst for Apple's stock price movement. Given this context, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a neutral to slightly positive outlook, considering Apple's ongoing AI developments and its competitive strengths.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Perplexity's AI assistant launch on Android does not directly imply a significant impact on Apple's stock price.
