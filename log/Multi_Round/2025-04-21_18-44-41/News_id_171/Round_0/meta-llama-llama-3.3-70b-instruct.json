(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\nNews Content: (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity launched an agent-based assistant for Android devices on Thursday as it looks to take on larger rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and incumbent assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.\n\n\"We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,\" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.\n\nOpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.\n\nTech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.\n\nLast year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the \"coming months.\"\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Although the article mentions Apple and its voice assistant, Siri, the news does not directly imply a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the fact that Perplexity expressed interest in making its assistant available on iOS, pending Apple's permission, could be seen as a neutral to slightly positive development for Apple, as it suggests potential future collaboration or integration opportunities. Given the competitive landscape and the ongoing advancements in AI technology, the overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news is estimated to be relatively low.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}"
