This is generally positive news for the stock market as it suggests inflation may be under control, reducing the likelihood of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed.  Since Apple is a major component of US equity indexes, this positive market sentiment is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. However, without access to the full news article, the impact's magnitude is uncertain.  The probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but other factors not mentioned in the headline could influence the stock price.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equity Indexes Rise as Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Comes in Line With Expectations\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```\n"
