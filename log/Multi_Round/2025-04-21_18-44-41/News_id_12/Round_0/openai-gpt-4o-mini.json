This generally suggests a stable economic environment, which is positive for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that AAPL is a major player in the tech sector and often benefits from overall market sentiment, the probability of its stock price rising is higher. However, market reactions can be unpredictable, and there is still a chance of a decline due to profit-taking or other market factors. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equity Indexes Rise as Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Comes in Line With Expectations\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}"
