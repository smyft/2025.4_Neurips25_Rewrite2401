A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes have risen due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure aligning with expectations. This generally suggests a stable economic environment, which is positive for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that AAPL is a major player in the tech sector and often benefits from overall market sentiment, the probability of its stock price rising is higher. However, market reactions can be unpredictable, and there is still a chance of a decline due to profit-taking or other market factors. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are rising because the Fed's preferred inflation gauge came in line with expectations. This suggests that the market is reacting positively to the inflation data, implying that the Fed may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as previously feared. Lower interest rate expectations are generally positive for stock prices, as they reduce borrowing costs for companies and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds. Since the overall market is rising, it is likely that Apple (AAPL) will also experience a positive movement. However, the news is quite general and doesn't specifically mention Apple, so the impact might be moderate. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall limits the depth of the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose because the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge met expectations.  This is generally positive news for the stock market as it suggests inflation may be under control, reducing the likelihood of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed.  Since Apple is a major component of US equity indexes, this positive market sentiment is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. However, without access to the full news article, the impact's magnitude is uncertain.  The probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but other factors not mentioned in the headline could influence the stock price.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, as inflation data in line with expectations reduces uncertainty about future Fed actions, such as interest rate hikes. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major component of US equity indexes, is likely to benefit from this broader market uplift. However, since the full content of the news article is not available, the analysis is based solely on the headline and general market behavior.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in line with expectations. This suggests a positive market reaction to the news, which could imply that Apple's stock price may also rise. As the news is neutral to positive for the overall market and does not contain any negative information specific to Apple, it is reasonable to assume that Apple's stock price has a higher chance of rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which could have a favorable impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the inflation gauge came in line with expectations, it may alleviate concerns about inflation and interest rate hikes, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a rise in stock prices. However, the direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect, as it is a general market trend rather than company-specific news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes rose because the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations. This suggests a positive outlook on economic conditions, which typically has a favorable impact on broad market stocks like those of Apple Inc. Since Apple's performance is closely tied to broader market trends, it is likely to benefit from improved investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure aligning with expectations, which generally suggests a stable economic environment. This is positive for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it implies reduced uncertainty regarding interest rate hikes. Given that AAPL is a significant player in the tech sector and often benefits from overall market sentiment, the probability of its stock price rising is higher. However, the lack of specific news about Apple means there is still a chance for a decline due to other market factors. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that the news is generally positive for the market, and therefore likely positive for Apple (AAPL). The Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations suggests a stable economic environment, reducing the likelihood of aggressive interest rate hikes. This is typically favorable for stock prices. Most models have assigned a higher probability to a price rise. Given this established trend and the lack of any new negative information, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of market movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the market, indicating that inflation is under control, which is generally good for stocks.  All previous models predicted a higher probability of a price rise for Apple, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.  The consensus points towards a positive market reaction, and Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. However, the lack of specific information about Apple in the news article limits the certainty of the prediction.  The range of previous predictions suggests some uncertainty, and the fact that the full article is behind a paywall prevents a more in-depth analysis.  Therefore, I'm leaning towards the consensus but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of other market factors influencing the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market reaction as US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a stable economic environment, which is generally favorable for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given AAPL's prominence in the tech sector and its correlation with broader market trends, the probability of its stock price rising is higher. Previous predictions from various models also support this view, with most assigning a higher probability to a price rise (ranging from 0.6 to 0.7) compared to a fall (ranging from 0.3 to 0.4). The consensus leans towards a positive impact, albeit with some uncertainty due to the lack of specific details about Apple in the news. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations.

The consensus from various predictions is that the stock price has a higher chance of rising than falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 for a rise and 0.3 to 0.4 for a fall. Considering the positive market sentiment and Apple's significant presence in the market, I estimate a slightly higher probability for the stock price to rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure aligning with expectations, suggesting a stable economic environment. This is generally positive for large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL).

The previous predictions from other models also suggest a higher probability of a price rise, with estimates ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. Considering this information, I estimate a probability of stock price rise of 0.68, slightly above the average of the previous predictions, and a probability of stock price fall of 0.32, slightly below the average of the previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure meeting expectations.

Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Considering the consensus and the positive market environment, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of market movements and the lack of company-specific news. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall also limits the depth of the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is positive for the overall market as inflation is in line with expectations, reducing the likelihood of aggressive interest rate hikes.

The consensus among previous models is that Apple's stock price is more likely to rise than fall, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 for a rise and 0.25 to 0.4 for a fall.  However, the lack of Apple-specific news and the limited information in the headline create uncertainty.  The upward trend in predictions across rounds suggests increasing confidence in a positive market reaction.  Considering the positive market sentiment and the consensus, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market reaction as US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations.
