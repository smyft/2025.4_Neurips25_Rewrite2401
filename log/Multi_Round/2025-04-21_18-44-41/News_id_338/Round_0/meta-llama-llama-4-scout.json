The tone suggests a consideration of the company's position and potential rather than providing a specific event or earnings data that could drive the stock price up or down. Given the neutral nature of the headline and the lack of specific information that could be considered positive or negative, it is reasonable to assume that the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are equal. However, given that the news is about Apple being considered a buy, sell, or hold, it might slightly lean towards a positive consideration, but not significantly. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.5 and falling as 0.5.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
