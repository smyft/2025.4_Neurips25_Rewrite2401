(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, primarily in share buybacks, which has historically supported stock prices by reducing outstanding shares and increasing EPS. However, concerns about stagnant sales in physical products and a high P/E ratio suggest potential overvaluation. While the buyback program may provide some support, the lack of growth in product sales and high valuation could lead to downward pressure on the stock. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise due to the buyback program.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, it highlights Apple's massive stock buyback program, which has significantly boosted EPS and incentivized long-term investing. The article also mentions the continued strength of the iPhone and the growth of Apple's services segment. However, there are also negative points. The article points out that physical product sales have stalled, and Apple's P/E ratio is historically high. Furthermore, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stake in Apple, signaling potential concerns about valuation or future growth. The article also mentions Apple Intelligence, which is a positive catalyst. Considering these factors, the positive aspects related to the buyback program and services growth are somewhat offset by concerns about product sales, valuation, and Buffett's reduced stake. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so. The 'Double Down' advertisement is disregarded as it is promotional material and not directly related to the core analysis of Apple's financial health based on the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock buyback program as the primary driver of its EPS growth, overshadowing its AI investments. While this buyback program reduces outstanding shares and boosts EPS, potentially attracting investors, the article also points out concerns: stagnant physical product sales for two years, and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42.  Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stake further adds to the negative sentiment. The high valuation and slowing sales growth outweigh the positive impact of the buyback program and AI initiatives in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise, although the overall market conditions mentioned (strong bull market) could partially mitigate the negative impact of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant investment in stock repurchases, which has been a major driver of its earnings per share (EPS) growth. The article notes that Apple has reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% over 11 years, boosting EPS. This could make the stock more attractive to investors. However, the article also points out concerns such as stagnant sales of Apple's physical products and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, which may deter some investors. Additionally, Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple signals potential overvaluation. The positive aspects of buybacks and strong services growth are balanced by these negative factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's significant investment of $725 billion in stock repurchases over 11 years, which has reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% and boosted its earnings per share (EPS). While this investment has fueled Apple's growth, the article also highlights concerns about the company's physical product sales stalling and its historically high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of over 42. Despite these concerns, the article presents a positive view of Apple's growth driven by its share buybacks and subscription services. However, the mixed signals about Apple's product sales and valuation could temper investor enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's $725 billion investment in share repurchases, which has fueled the company's growth and increased its earnings per share. However, it also notes that Apple's physical product sales have stalled, and the stock's price-to-earnings ratio is historically high. Additionally, billionaire Warren Buffett has sold a significant portion of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, which could be a sign of caution. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still relatively high due to Apple's strong brand and continued innovation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's significant stock repurchase program and its impact on EPS growth, which has been a strong contributor to the company's stock performance. However, concerns are raised regarding the stagnation in physical product sales and the historically high P/E ratio, which could negatively affect investor sentiment. The recent sell-off by Warren Buffett adds to these concerns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment in stock buybacks, which has historically supported stock prices by reducing outstanding shares and increasing earnings per share (EPS). However, concerns about stagnant sales in physical products and a historically high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio suggest potential overvaluation. While the buyback program may provide some support, the lack of growth in product sales and high valuation could lead to downward pressure on the stock. The mixed signals from the news, along with the previous predictions, indicate a cautious outlook with a slight edge towards a price rise due to the buyback program, but overall sentiment leans towards a potential decline due to valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The previous rounds show a trend towards a more bearish outlook on Apple, primarily due to concerns about stagnant product sales, high valuation (P/E ratio), and Warren Buffett's reduced stake. While the buyback program is a positive factor, its impact seems to be diminishing in the face of these negative signals. The models are increasingly weighing the negative aspects more heavily. Given this trend and the continued concerns highlighted in the news, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a higher likelihood of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The massive $725 billion stock buyback program is a significant positive, demonstrably boosting EPS and signaling confidence from insiders.  However, this is counterbalanced by serious concerns: stagnant physical product sales for two consecutive years, a historically high P/E ratio exceeding 42, and Warren Buffett's substantial reduction of his stake.  While the buybacks artificially inflate EPS, the underlying sales stagnation suggests a potential lack of future growth. The high P/E ratio indicates the market is already pricing in significant future growth, making the stock vulnerable to negative surprises. Buffett's actions are a strong bearish signal, suggesting he sees better investment opportunities elsewhere.  The overall market's bullish trend might offer some support, but the fundamental issues with Apple's product sales and valuation are significant enough to outweigh the positive impact of the buybacks in the short to medium term. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the weight of the negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 are noted. Additionally, Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple signals potential overvaluation. Balancing these factors, the positive impact of the buyback program on EPS and investor sentiment is countered by negative factors such as high valuation and slowing sales growth. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of a fall, reflecting a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, highlighting both positive and negative factors.
