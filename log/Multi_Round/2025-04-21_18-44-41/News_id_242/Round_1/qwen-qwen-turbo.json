(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's service restoration and Trump's involvement suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressure on tech companies like Apple. However, the uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the law and the bipartisan support for it raises concerns. While there may be a short-term positive sentiment due to the potential for TikTok to remain operational, the long-term implications of regulatory scrutiny could weigh on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about a rise in stock price, balanced by the risk of a fall due to regulatory uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and subsequent restoration of service has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, a TikTok ban could benefit Apple indirectly as users and advertisers might shift to platforms accessible through the App Store, potentially increasing Apple's revenue from app sales and in-app purchases. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban, the political maneuvering, and the potential for a reversal create volatility. The fact that the app was briefly unavailable on the App Store could also be seen as a negative, highlighting the potential for future disruptions. The news also mentions that Google and Microsoft have taken steps to comply with the law, which could be interpreted as a sign that the ban is likely to proceed. Given these conflicting factors, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain, but the potential for increased app store revenue is a slightly positive factor. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not by a large margin.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the initial shutdown might have seemed positive for Apple (as it removed a competitor from the App Store), the subsequent restoration, driven by Trump's intervention, negates this positive impact.  The uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok in the US, coupled with the legal challenges and political infighting, creates a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple.  Apple's involvement is indirect; the law affects their App Store's compliance and potential fines. The potential for significant fines if Apple doesn't comply is a risk, but the likelihood of a complete and permanent TikTok ban remains uncertain.  The article also highlights potential benefits for Meta, a competitor, which could indirectly negatively impact Apple's stock price if users shift to Meta's platforms. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, while the probability of a fall is also relatively low, leaning towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the temporary shutdown and potential restoration of TikTok services in the US, with implications for tech companies like Apple (AAPL). Apple's App Store was mentioned as one of the platforms affected by the TikTok ban. The uncertainty around the ban's enforcement and potential political resolutions could create volatility. However, Apple's diversified business model and strong ecosystem may mitigate significant negative impact. The news does not directly indicate a major positive or negative catalyst for Apple's stock, but the resolution of the TikTok issue could restore some stability. Given the mixed signals and lack of direct financial impact on Apple, the probabilities are balanced with a slight tilt towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential shutdown and its impact on tech companies, particularly Apple (AAPL) which operates the App Store where TikTok was previously available, could have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. However, given that TikTok's availability does not directly correlate with Apple's core business or revenue streams significantly, and considering that TikTok's ban or availability does not directly influence Apple's major services or products, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal. The situation could potentially benefit competitors in the social media space or related sectors but does not directly threaten Apple's core business. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news seems relatively low, unless broader market sentiments or regulatory actions against TikTok influence investor perceptions about Apple's ecosystem and services.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown of TikTok in the US due to a new law banning the app, and the potential for President Trump to issue an executive order to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect. This situation may impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company's App Store is involved in the ban. However, the article does not directly mention any significant negative impact on Apple's business. Instead, it highlights the potential beneficiaries of a TikTok ban, such as Meta (META) and other social media companies. Considering this, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, as the impact on Apple is indirect and not significantly negative.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential impact on TikTok's operations in the U.S. and the involvement of Apple (AAPL) and other companies in compliance with the new law. The news indicates that TikTok is working towards restoring service after going dark. While this situation may affect the stock price of companies like Apple, which hosts TikTok in its app store, the direct impact on Apple's stock might be minimal since the event primarily affects TikTok. The broader market sentiment, regulatory actions, and long-term impacts need consideration.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
