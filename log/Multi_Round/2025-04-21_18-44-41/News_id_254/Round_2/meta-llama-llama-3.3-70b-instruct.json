In 2023, Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d marked the year\u2019s biggest blockbuster, grossing nearly $1.5 billion globally.\n\nNetflix also remained focused on sports events, which likely drove 9 million subscriber additions in the holiday quarter, courtesy of the \u201cJake Paul vs. Mike Tyson\u201d boxing match, National Football League games, and the \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nAfter its password-sharing crackdown, The streaming giant added premium sports content to its platform to attract younger viewers and advertising dollars.\n\nBMO Capital\u2018s Brian Pitz expects Netflix\u2019s advertising-based video-on-demand (AVOD) monthly active users (MAUs) to reach 90 million by 2025, up from 70 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, backed by Squid Game 2 and WWE.\n\nPrice Actions: IMAX stock is up 3.09% at $23.08 at last check Friday.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on IMAX securing a deal with Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the 'Narnia' film, which has positively impacted IMAX's stock price. While this news is significant for IMAX, it does not directly affect Apple's stock. However, the mention of Apple as a competitor in the theatrical release space may suggest that Apple could benefit indirectly if the trend of theatrical releases continues to grow. Given the positive sentiment around IMAX and Netflix, there is a slight chance that Apple's stock could see a rise due to overall market optimism. However, the direct impact on Apple is minimal, leading to a lower probability of significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on IMAX and Netflix, with Apple (AAPL) only mentioned as a comparator to Netflix's previous reluctance to theatrical releases. The IMAX stock jumped on the news, and Netflix also saw a rise. The news is generally positive for IMAX and Netflix, suggesting a potential shift in Netflix's strategy that could be beneficial. However, the direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is minimal. While the article mentions Apple allowing theatrical releases, this is not new information and doesn't directly influence Apple's stock based on this specific news. Therefore, the probability of AAPL rising or falling significantly based solely on this news is relatively low, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the overall positive sentiment in the streaming/entertainment industry.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on IMAX and Netflix's deal for the theatrical release of 'Narnia'.  While Apple is mentioned in passing as a competitor that has released movies theatrically before streaming, the news is not directly relevant to Apple's business or financial performance. The article highlights Netflix's strategy of theatrical releases for select films and its success in attracting subscribers.  There is no information provided that would suggest a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price change for Apple due to this news is considered negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia,' which positively impacted IMAX's stock. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a rival streamer that allows theatrical releases before streaming, but the news does not directly impact AAPL's operations or financials. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant effect on AAPL's stock price. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance to AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has caused IMAX stock to jump. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions. Despite this, there is no direct positive or negative news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the article. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are estimated based on the indirect relevance and potential market sentiment. Given that the news does not directly impact AAPL and considering the neutral to positive market sentiment around streaming and theatrical releases, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to overall market trends and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the film 'Narnia', which has led to a jump in IMAX's stock price. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. as a rival streamer that has allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services. Since the news is primarily about IMAX and Netflix, and Apple is only mentioned as a competitor, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space could potentially lead to a slight increase in Apple's stock price due to the growing demand for streaming services and theatrical releases.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia.' This deal is expected to bring substantial benefits to both companies, as it leverages IMAX's theater network and Netflix's content production capabilities. The news has already caused IMAX's stock to jump, suggesting positive investor sentiment. However, since the news does not directly reference Apple Inc., we need to consider indirect impacts such as potential increased competition or collaboration effects. Given the focus on the deal between IMAX and Netflix, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on IMAX securing a deal with Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the 'Narnia' film, which has positively impacted IMAX's stock price. While Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the theatrical release space, the direct impact on Apple's stock is minimal. The overall market sentiment around streaming and theatrical releases is positive, which could lead to a slight increase in Apple's stock price. However, the lack of direct relevance to Apple's operations suggests that the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the IMAX-Netflix deal, with Apple mentioned only as a competitor that also releases movies theatrically. The previous predictions vary widely, with some seeing a slight positive impact due to overall market sentiment, while others see minimal impact. Considering the lack of direct impact and the mixed opinions from previous rounds, I'll lean towards a neutral stance, but slightly adjust the probabilities based on the general positive sentiment in the streaming/entertainment industry and the fact that Apple is a major player in that space. The previous round predictions are quite diverse, ranging from 0.05 to 0.55 for the probability of a rise, indicating a high degree of uncertainty. I will adjust my prediction to be slightly more conservative, acknowledging the limited direct impact but also the potential for indirect positive influence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news focuses on IMAX and Netflix's deal for a theatrical release of 'Narnia'.  Apple is mentioned only in passing as a competitor that also employs a theatrical release strategy before streaming.  The news is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance. While a positive sentiment in the entertainment industry *could* indirectly benefit Apple, the connection is weak.  The previous predictions show a wide range, with most models assigning a low probability of significant price movement for AAPL.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the consensus of previous models, I predict a very low probability of a significant price change in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia,' which has positively impacted IMAX's stock. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space, but the news does not directly impact Apple's operations or financials. Given the lack of direct relevance to AAPL and the neutral to slightly positive market sentiment around streaming and theatrical releases, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple is low. The slight mention of Apple as a competitor might lead to minimal indirect effects, but these are unlikely to cause substantial price changes.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia,' which has positively impacted IMAX's stock price. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a competitor that has allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services. However, there is no direct positive or negative news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the article.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a rival streamer that allows theatrical releases before streaming, but the news does not directly impact AAPL's operations or financials. Considering the indirect relevance and potential market sentiment, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are estimated.

Apple Inc. is mentioned only in passing as a rival in the theatrical release space. While this news indicates a growing trend towards theatrical releases, it doesn't provide direct information affecting Apple's stock price. The previous predictions from various models suggest a slight neutral to positive sentiment, but the impact on Apple remains indirect. Hence, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple is low.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
