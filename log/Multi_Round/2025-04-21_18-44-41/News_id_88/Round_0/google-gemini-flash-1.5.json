(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While initial reactions suggest decreased AI spending due to increased efficiency, the expert interviewed believes that medium-term compute intensity and GPU needs might actually increase. This creates uncertainty.  Apple's direct involvement in the immediate impact of DeepSeek's advancements is not explicitly mentioned.  The news focuses more on the broader tech sector and chip manufacturers like Nvidia.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and less significant than the impact on companies directly involved in GPU manufacturing or AI model development.  The overall market sentiment is one of cautious optimism, with a recovery underway after the initial sell-off.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the uncertain outlook on AI spending, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```\n"
