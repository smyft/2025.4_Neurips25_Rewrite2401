(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential recovery in tech stocks following a sell-off, which could positively impact Apple Inc. as a major player in the tech sector. The commentary from T. Rowe Price suggests that while there may be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong. This could imply that Apple, which invests heavily in AI and technology, may benefit from increased demand and innovation in the sector. However, there is also a cautionary note regarding potential overconcentration and scaling back of investments by some tech players, which could create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, but with some risk of volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The initial tech sell-off driven by DeepSeek AI's advancements initially caused concern about reduced AI spending by Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple that are investing heavily in AI. However, the expert analysis suggests that the DeepSeek innovation might actually increase compute intensity and GPU demand in the medium term, which could benefit companies like Nvidia but also indirectly benefit Apple if it leads to more advanced AI applications. The expert also highlights that the rate of AI spending is a business model question for hyperscalers, implying that Apple's specific strategy will be crucial. The easing of the tech sell-off is a positive sign. Overall, the news is slightly positive, but with some uncertainty. I am giving a slightly higher probability to a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, impacting the overall AI spending outlook for Big Tech.  While initial reactions suggest decreased AI spending due to increased efficiency, the expert interviewed believes that medium-term compute intensity and GPU needs might actually increase. This creates uncertainty.  Apple's direct involvement in the immediate impact of DeepSeek's advancements is not explicitly mentioned.  The news focuses more on the broader tech sector and chip manufacturers like Nvidia.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and less significant than the impact on companies directly involved in GPU manufacturing or AI model development.  The overall market sentiment is one of cautious optimism, with a recovery underway after the initial sell-off.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the uncertain outlook on AI spending, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a tech sell-off, particularly influenced by DeepSeek AI's advancements, on Big Tech's AI spending. While there is short-term concern about overconcentration and spending, the medium-term outlook remains strong with potential increased compute needs benefiting companies like Apple, which is heavily invested in AI and technology. The initial negative reaction might cause a slight dip, but the long-term prospects and Apple's position in the tech sector suggest resilience and potential growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on Big Tech's spending on AI, causing a tech sell-off. However, according to T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo, while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong. He suggests that AI spending might not decrease but could instead increase in compute intensity and GPU utilization. This outlook is generally positive for tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it suggests that the sector's long-term prospects remain intact despite short-term volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek AI on Big Tech's spending on AI, with a portfolio manager suggesting that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong.
