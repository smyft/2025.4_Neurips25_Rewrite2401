      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: All Eyes Are on the iPhone\nNews Content: Apple earnings are expected to show growth from last year, but it\u2019s iPhone demand that\u2019s still top of mind concern for investors. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to report earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $124.3 billion. In the same period last year, Apple posted EPS of $2.18 with revenue of $119.6 billion.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with EPS projected to rise from $2.18 to $2.35 and revenue increasing from $119.6 billion to $124.3 billion. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the overall positive earnings forecast, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern about iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on iPhone demand as the primary concern for investors, even though earnings are expected to show growth. While the expected EPS and revenue are higher than the previous year, the emphasis on iPhone demand suggests that any shortfall in iPhone sales could negatively impact the stock price. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether Apple meets, exceeds, or falls short of iPhone sales expectations. Given the uncertainty and the focus on a single product line, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. If iPhone sales are strong, the stock will likely rise. If they are weak, the stock will likely fall. The market has already priced in some growth, so simply meeting expectations might not be enough to cause a significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple is expected to show earnings growth, investor focus remains heavily on iPhone demand.  The projected EPS and revenue growth are modest (around 8% and 4% respectively).  If Apple meets or slightly exceeds expectations, the stock price might see a modest rise, but if iPhone sales disappoint, even if overall earnings are positive, the stock price could fall. The uncertainty surrounding iPhone demand creates a significant risk factor.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of a price rise given the expected earnings growth, but a significant possibility of a price fall if iPhone sales are weaker than anticipated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. While the earnings growth is a positive signal, the uncertainty around iPhone demand could temper investor optimism. Overall, the mixed sentiment (positive earnings growth but concerns about iPhone demand) suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the earnings beat, but with notable risk of a fall if iPhone demand disappoints.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Apple's upcoming earnings report, with expectations of growth in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue compared to the same period last year. However, the primary concern for investors is iPhone demand. The expected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion represent growth, which is a positive indicator. Yet, the emphasis on iPhone demand suggests that investors are cautious about the company's future performance. Given that the expectations are already priced into the stock, any positive surprise in the earnings report could lead to a stock price rise, while a negative surprise or weak iPhone demand outlook could lead to a fall. Based on the information provided, it seems that the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to the expected growth, but with a significant risk of a negative reaction if iPhone demand concerns are not alleviated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth from last year, with expected earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $124.3 billion, which is higher than the same period last year. This suggests a positive outlook for the company. However, the top of mind concern for investors is iPhone demand, which could potentially impact the stock price if the actual demand is lower than expected. Given the overall positive earnings expectation, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth, which is positive for the stock price. However, the focus on iPhone demand suggests that any deviation from these high expectations could have a significant impact. The projected earnings per share and revenue are both higher than the previous year, which is likely to be viewed positively by the market. Nonetheless, the stock price movement could be influenced by how well the iPhone sales meet investor expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, which is an improvement over last year's figures. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a primary concern introduces uncertainty. If iPhone sales meet or exceed expectations, the stock price is likely to rise. Conversely, if iPhone demand falls short, it could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a price drop. Given the overall positive earnings forecast but significant risk associated with iPhone demand, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of a fall if demand disappoints.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive outlook due to expected earnings growth. However, the persistent concern about iPhone demand introduces significant uncertainty. The models' predictions range from slightly bearish (0.45 rise) to quite bullish (0.75 rise). Considering the trend and the emphasis on iPhone demand as a potential risk factor, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly more conservative than the most bullish predictions, but still leaning towards a rise given the expected growth. The market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual iPhone sales figures and the management's guidance on future demand.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings show growth (EPS up ~8%, revenue up ~4%), the significant emphasis on iPhone demand as the key investor concern introduces considerable uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning bullish due to the expected earnings beat and others more bearish due to the iPhone demand uncertainty.  The modest growth projections suggest that simply meeting expectations might not be enough to significantly boost the stock price.  Therefore, a substantial positive surprise regarding iPhone sales is needed for a significant price rise. Conversely, even a slight miss on iPhone sales could trigger a price drop, despite the overall earnings growth. Considering the overall sentiment and the potential for both positive and negative surprises, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to the expected earnings growth but acknowledging the significant risk of a fall if iPhone sales disappoint.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with EPS projected to rise from $2.18 to $2.35 and revenue increasing from $119.6 billion to $124.3 billion. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the overall positive earnings forecast, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern about iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a higher probability of a rise (with some models like qwen/qwen-turbo predicting 0.75), but also acknowledge the risk from iPhone demand, I am inclined to slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a balanced but optimistic view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, which represents an increase from the previous year's $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue. However, the primary concern for investors remains iPhone demand. Given that the earnings growth is modest and largely expected, the market's reaction will likely depend on whether Apple meets, exceeds, or falls short of iPhone sales expectations. If the company meets or exceeds expectations, especially regarding iPhone demand, the stock price is likely to rise. Conversely, if iPhone sales are weak or do not meet expectations, the stock could fall. Based on the overall positive earnings forecast but with caution regarding iPhone demand, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth from last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, which suggests a positive outlook for the company. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern for investors introduces uncertainty. Considering the overall positive earnings expectation and the potential risk from iPhone demand, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The predictions from other models also suggest a range of opinions, with some weighing the positive earnings growth more heavily and others emphasizing the risk from iPhone demand. Given the mixed sentiment, I lean towards a moderate probability of a stock price rise, acknowledging the potential for a fall if iPhone demand disappoints.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's expected earnings growth, which is positive for the stock price. However, the primary concern for investors is iPhone demand, which could impact the stock price if it doesn't meet expectations. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, reflecting the mixed sentiment around the stock due to the focus on iPhone demand. Considering the overall positive earnings expectations and the general market optimism, there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise. However, the substantial focus on iPhone demand introduces considerable risk, suggesting a non-negligible probability of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, which is an improvement over last year's figures. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a primary concern introduces uncertainty. If iPhone sales meet or exceed expectations, the stock price is likely to rise. Conversely, if iPhone demand falls short, it could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a price drop. Given the overall positive earnings forecast but significant risk associated with iPhone demand, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of a fall if demand disappoints.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds indicates a generally positive outlook due to expected earnings growth. However, the recurring concern about iPhone demand introduces significant uncertainty and acts as a major risk factor. The models' predictions range from slightly bearish to bullish, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the emphasis on iPhone demand as a potential risk factor, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly more conservative than the most bullish predictions, but still leaning towards a rise given the expected growth. The market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual iPhone sales figures and the management's guidance on future demand. I am also factoring in the modest growth projections, which suggest that simply meeting expectations might not be enough to significantly boost the stock price. Therefore, a substantial positive surprise regarding iPhone sales is needed for a significant price rise. Conversely, even a slight miss on iPhone sales could trigger a price drop, despite the overall earnings growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings show modest growth, the overwhelming focus on iPhone demand as the key investor concern introduces significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, reflecting this mixed sentiment.  The consensus leans slightly bullish due to the expected earnings beat, but the risk of iPhone sales disappointing remains substantial.  A significant positive surprise regarding iPhone sales would be needed for a substantial price rise; conversely, even a slight miss could trigger a price drop despite overall earnings growth.  Considering the overall sentiment and the potential for both positive and negative surprises, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to the expected earnings growth but acknowledging the significant risk of a fall if iPhone sales disappoint.  The iterative predictions show a slight convergence towards a higher probability of a rise, but the uncertainty around iPhone demand persists as a major factor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company is expected to report growth in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, with EPS projected at $2.35 and revenue at $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 and $119.6 billion respectively in the same period last year. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the primary concern for investors is iPhone demand, which introduces significant uncertainty. If iPhone sales meet or exceed expectations, the stock price is likely to rise. Conversely, if demand falls short, it could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a price drop. Considering the overall positive earnings forecast but the notable risk associated with iPhone demand, the probabilities are weighted towards a modestly higher chance of the stock price rising, but with a significant possibility of a fall if iPhone sales disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is expected to report earnings growth, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year.

Considering the overall sentiment and the potential for both positive and negative surprises, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to the expected earnings growth but acknowledging the significant risk of a fall if iPhone sales disappoint. Given the trend of previous predictions converging around 0.6, I will stick with a similar estimate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While expected earnings show modest growth (around 8% EPS and 4% revenue), the overwhelming focus on iPhone demand as the primary investor concern introduces significant uncertainty.  Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, reflecting this mixed sentiment.  The consensus leans slightly bullish due to the expected earnings beat, but the risk of iPhone sales disappointing remains substantial. A significant positive surprise regarding iPhone sales would be needed for a substantial price rise; conversely, even a slight miss could trigger a price drop despite overall earnings growth.  Considering the overall sentiment and the potential for both positive and negative surprises, and the iterative convergence of predictions towards a higher probability of a rise, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to the expected earnings growth but acknowledging the significant risk of a fall if iPhone sales disappoint. The slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise across the prediction rounds suggests a growing confidence in the positive earnings outlook, but the persistent concern about iPhone demand keeps the probability of a fall from being negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is expected to report earnings growth, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year.
