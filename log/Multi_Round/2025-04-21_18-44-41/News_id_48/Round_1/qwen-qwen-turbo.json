      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: All Eyes Are on the iPhone\nNews Content: Apple earnings are expected to show growth from last year, but it\u2019s iPhone demand that\u2019s still top of mind concern for investors. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to report earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $124.3 billion. In the same period last year, Apple posted EPS of $2.18 with revenue of $119.6 billion.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report earnings growth, with EPS projected to rise from $2.18 to $2.35 and revenue increasing from $119.6 billion to $124.3 billion. This positive earnings outlook generally supports a bullish sentiment. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand as a concern suggests that if the demand does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the overall positive earnings forecast, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the concern about iPhone demand introduces some risk, leading to a lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on iPhone demand as the primary concern for investors, even though earnings are expected to show growth. While the expected EPS and revenue are higher than the previous year, the emphasis on iPhone demand suggests that any shortfall in iPhone sales could negatively impact the stock price. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether Apple meets, exceeds, or falls short of iPhone sales expectations. Given the uncertainty and the focus on a single product line, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. If iPhone sales are strong, the stock will likely rise. If they are weak, the stock will likely fall. The market has already priced in some growth, so simply meeting expectations might not be enough to cause a significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple is expected to show earnings growth, investor focus remains heavily on iPhone demand.  The projected EPS and revenue growth are modest (around 8% and 4% respectively).  If Apple meets or slightly exceeds expectations, the stock price might see a modest rise, but if iPhone sales disappoint, even if overall earnings are positive, the stock price could fall. The uncertainty surrounding iPhone demand creates a significant risk factor.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of a price rise given the expected earnings growth, but a significant possibility of a price fall if iPhone sales are weaker than anticipated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue in the same period last year. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. While the earnings growth is a positive signal, the uncertainty around iPhone demand could temper investor optimism. Overall, the mixed sentiment (positive earnings growth but concerns about iPhone demand) suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the earnings beat, but with notable risk of a fall if iPhone demand disappoints.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Apple's upcoming earnings report, with expectations of growth in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue compared to the same period last year. However, the primary concern for investors is iPhone demand. The expected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion represent growth, which is a positive indicator. Yet, the emphasis on iPhone demand suggests that investors are cautious about the company's future performance. Given that the expectations are already priced into the stock, any positive surprise in the earnings report could lead to a stock price rise, while a negative surprise or weak iPhone demand outlook could lead to a fall. Based on the information provided, it seems that the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to the expected growth, but with a significant risk of a negative reaction if iPhone demand concerns are not alleviated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth from last year, with expected earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $124.3 billion, which is higher than the same period last year. This suggests a positive outlook for the company. However, the top of mind concern for investors is iPhone demand, which could potentially impact the stock price if the actual demand is lower than expected. Given the overall positive earnings expectation, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth, which is positive for the stock price. However, the focus on iPhone demand suggests that any deviation from these high expectations could have a significant impact. The projected earnings per share and revenue are both higher than the previous year, which is likely to be viewed positively by the market. Nonetheless, the stock price movement could be influenced by how well the iPhone sales meet investor expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
