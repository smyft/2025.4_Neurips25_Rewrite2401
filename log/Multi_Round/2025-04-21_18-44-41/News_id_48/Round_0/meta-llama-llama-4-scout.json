However, the primary concern for investors is iPhone demand. The expected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion represent growth, which is a positive indicator. Yet, the emphasis on iPhone demand suggests that investors are cautious about the company's future performance. Given that the expectations are already priced into the stock, any positive surprise in the earnings report could lead to a stock price rise, while a negative surprise or weak iPhone demand outlook could lead to a fall. Based on the information provided, it seems that the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a positive reaction due to the expected growth, but with a significant risk of a negative reaction if iPhone demand concerns are not alleviated.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"All Eyes Are on the iPhone\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
