(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trending tickers: Apple, Intel, Novartis, Shell, Smiths Group\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL)\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday, following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure. Next steps will be closely watched, with Engine also floating the possibility of a US listing for its John Crane energy services arm which Engine describes as its jewel in the crown.\u201d\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SMIN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price.

Despite a strong performance in net income and services revenue, concerns about the rollout of AI features and declining revenue from China may temper investor enthusiasm. Analysts have mixed views, with some highlighting the need for Apple to accelerate its AI offerings to drive upgrades. Overall, the positive earnings report suggests a higher probability of stock price rise, but the caution surrounding AI and market conditions introduces some risk of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock is trading higher in premarket due to a better-than-expected earnings report. Net income and sales are up, and services revenue is growing strongly. However, China revenue is down, and there are concerns about the rollout of Apple Intelligence, particularly its limited language support. Analysts have mixed opinions, with some seeing it as a strong quarter and others questioning Apple's AI strategy. The year-to-date performance is negative, influenced by broader tech sector concerns. Considering the positive earnings report and premarket surge, the probability of a rise is higher, but the AI concerns and China revenue decline introduce some uncertainty. The positive premarket movement is a strong indicator, but the negative sentiment around AI implementation and the China slowdown temper the outlook. The overall market sentiment and upcoming news events will also play a role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a premarket surge of 3.4% following a strong quarterly earnings report that exceeded expectations.  While net income and sales showed healthy growth, concerns remain regarding the slow rollout of AI services, particularly the lack of non-English language support and the cautious approach to AI integration. Analyst comments highlight both positive aspects (strong quarter, exceeding expectations) and negative aspects (slow AI rollout, potential for hindering handset upgrades). The year-to-date performance is negative, influenced by broader tech sector anxieties. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the earnings report, but the lingering concerns about AI strategy temper this optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong quarterly performance with net income up 7% and sales up 4% year-over-year, alongside a 14% increase in services revenue. The stock was already trading 3.4% higher in premarket, indicating positive market reaction. However, concerns about slower AI rollout and a decline in China revenue (-11%) could temper gains. Analysts are optimistic but cautious about the pace of AI integration. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a rise is higher due to the overall strong earnings beat, but there is some risk of a pullback if AI concerns persist.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates. The company's net income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Services revenue was up 14%, although revenue from China was down 11%. Analysts have expressed mixed views, with one calling it 'another very strong quarter' and another expressing caution regarding Apple's approach to AI services. Given the positive premarket movement and beat of estimates, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, but concerns about AI rollout and competition may temper this rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's quarterly profit and sales exceeded estimates, with a 7% increase in net income and a 4% increase in sales. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% increase. However, the article also mentions that Apple's rollout of AI services has been slow and that the company is being cautious in its approach. Despite this, the overall tone of the article suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock. The premarket trading saw Apple's stock 3.4% higher, indicating a positive market reaction to the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
