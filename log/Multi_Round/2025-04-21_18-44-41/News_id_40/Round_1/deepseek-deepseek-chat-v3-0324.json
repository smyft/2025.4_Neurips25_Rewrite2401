      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Seeing iPhone Strength in Markets With AI\nNews Content: Apple Intelligence isn't available everywhere, but iPhone demand is stronger where the software is live, says CEO Tim Cook. On the conference call Thursday, Cook said that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger in places where the company has rolled out Apple Intelligence than where the software isn't yet available. \"The 16 outperformed the 15,\" Cook said.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is experiencing stronger iPhone demand in markets where its new AI software, Apple Intelligence, has been rolled out. This suggests positive consumer reception and potential for increased sales, which is likely to boost investor confidence. Tim Cook's comments about the iPhone 16 outperforming the previous model further support a bullish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Tim Cook's statement about stronger iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available indicates a potential driver for future revenue growth. The fact that the iPhone 16 is outperforming the iPhone 15 in these markets further reinforces this positive outlook. While the availability of Apple Intelligence is currently limited, the data suggests that its wider rollout could lead to increased iPhone sales and overall revenue. This positive sentiment is likely to encourage investors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, market sentiment can be influenced by other factors, and the impact of this news may be limited by the current availability of Apple Intelligence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence, suggesting a positive correlation between the software and product demand.  This implies successful integration of AI features and potentially increased customer loyalty and spending. While this is positive, it's important to note that this is only one factor influencing Apple's stock price.  Other macroeconomic factors, competition, and future product announcements will also play a significant role.  The statement is also somewhat vague, lacking specific sales figures or market share data. Therefore, while the news is generally positive, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate rather than dramatic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone 16 family is performing better year-over-year in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting strong demand driven by the AI features. This positive performance in key markets is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, as it signals continued product strength and potential revenue growth. Given the positive sentiment from the CEO and the focus on a high-margin product like the iPhone, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple's iPhone sales are stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence (AI) is available. This indicates a positive impact of AI features on iPhone demand. Given that the company's CEO, Tim Cook, mentioned the iPhone 16 family outperformed the iPhone 15 family in regions where Apple Intelligence has been rolled out, it implies that the integration of AI features could be a significant growth driver for Apple. This information is likely to be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to an increase in the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, which suggests a positive impact on iPhone sales. This strength in sales could lead to increased revenue and potentially better-than-expected earnings, which are factors that typically contribute to a stock price increase. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price of Apple Inc. might rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
