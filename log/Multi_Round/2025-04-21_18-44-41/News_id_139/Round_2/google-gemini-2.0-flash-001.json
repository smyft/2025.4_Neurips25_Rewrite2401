(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's market position, particularly in China, and potential revenue losses from legal challenges. Additionally, the lack of a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and high valuation metrics suggest bearish sentiment. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his entire stake in Apple, a move that indicates a lack of confidence in the stock, further supports the likelihood of a price decline. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a prominent hedge fund manager, Steven Cohen, sold his entire stake, signaling a lack of confidence. This is further supported by concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of revenue from the Google search deal, and the lack of an expected upgrade cycle driven by AI features. The high valuation relative to expected earnings growth also raises concerns. These factors suggest a potential price decrease. However, Apple is a strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. The 'Double Down' recommendation from Motley Fool, despite being a general advertisement, could also influence some investors positively. Considering these opposing forces, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stake is negative, the reasons cited for the sale \u2013 slowing iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the lack of a significant iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI features \u2013 are all significant concerns.  These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, existing services business, and projected 9% earnings growth offer some counterbalance.  The article's conclusion to \"avoid this stock\" strongly leans towards a negative outlook.  The information about Axon Enterprise is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement, except insofar as it highlights Cohen's shift in investment strategy away from Apple.  Considering the weight of negative factors, the probability of a price rise is assigned a lower value.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to regulatory issues, and lackluster consumer response to AI features. Additionally, the stock's current valuation is considered expensive with a P/E ratio of 33, and its recent price increase has been driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. The sale of Apple stock by a successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen further signals a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term prospects. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and bought a small position in Axon Enterprise (AXON). The article discusses various challenges faced by Apple, including loss of market share in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to a legal issue with Google, and the absence of an expected iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's current valuation of 33 times earnings appears expensive with expected earnings growth of 9%. For Axon Enterprise, the article highlights its strong growth trajectory, with revenue expected to increase 32% in 2024, and its leadership in public safety products with AI features. However, it also notes that Axon's valuation is concerning at 120 times adjusted earnings. Given that Cohen, a successful hedge fund manager, sold his Apple stake and bought into Axon, it suggests a vote of confidence in Axon's prospects and a lack of confidence in Apple's. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news might be limited as the sale took place in the third quarter and does not reflect current market conditions or future performance directly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses billionaire Steven Cohen's decision to sell his stake in Apple Inc. and invest in Axon Enterprise, a company that has seen significant growth in the AI sector. The article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue, and a lack of enthusiasm for its AI features. In contrast, Axon Enterprise has demonstrated strong growth and a solid financial performance. However, the article also notes that Axon's valuation is somewhat concerning. Based on this analysis, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher due to the challenges it faces, while Axon's stock price may rise despite its high valuation due to its strong growth trajectory.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that a well-regarded investor, Steven Cohen, has sold his entire stake in Apple, suggesting a lack of confidence in the company's future performance. This could be interpreted negatively by other investors, potentially leading to a decline in Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including loss of market share in China and potential revenue losses from the Safari search deal. On the other hand, Axon Enterprise is presented positively, showing strong growth and increasing demand for its AI-integrated products. However, the high valuation multiples for Axon may concern some investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's market position, particularly with declining iPhone sales in China and potential revenue losses from legal challenges. Steven Cohen's decision to sell his entire stake in Apple signals a lack of confidence, which could negatively influence other investors. Additionally, the absence of a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and high valuation metrics further support a bearish sentiment. While Apple has a strong brand and loyal customer base, the weight of the negative factors suggests a higher probability of a price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment across previous rounds, driven by concerns about Apple's performance in China, potential revenue losses, and lack of a significant upgrade cycle, reinforces the likelihood of a price decline. Steven Cohen's sale of his stake remains a significant negative signal. While Apple is a strong company, the immediate headwinds appear to outweigh any potential positive catalysts. The 'Double Down' advertisement is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment given the specific issues highlighted in the news article. The trend of predictions leaning towards a price fall further supports this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  While Apple remains a strong brand, the confluence of negative factors outweighs the positives.  The significant decline in iPhone sales in China, the potential loss of substantial services revenue, the lackluster response to AI features, and the high P/E ratio all point towards a potential price decline.  Steven Cohen's sale of his entire stake reinforces this negative sentiment. Although the Motley Fool's 'Double Down' recommendation is mentioned, it's presented as an advertisement and doesn't significantly alter the overall negative picture painted by the news.  The previous predictions also largely agree on a higher probability of a price fall. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including the sale of Steven Cohen's entire stake, declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue, and lackluster consumer response to AI features. Additionally, the stock's high valuation (P/E ratio of 33) and recent price increase driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth further support a bearish outlook. While Apple has a strong brand and loyal customer base, the weight of negative factors suggests a higher probability of a price decline. The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most assigning a 0.65-0.75 probability to a decline. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue due to a legal issue with Google, and the lack of an expected iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI features. Additionally, Steven Cohen's sale of his entire stake in Apple and purchase of Axon Enterprise suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. The current valuation of Apple at 33 times earnings appears expensive relative to its expected 9% earnings growth. While Apple has a strong brand and loyal customer base, the weight of these negative factors suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline. In contrast, Axon Enterprise, which Cohen bought into, shows strong growth potential and a leadership position in public safety products with AI features, but this information is more relevant to Axon's stock price than Apple's.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc.

These factors, combined with the prominent hedge fund manager Steven Cohen selling his entire stake in Apple, suggest a negative outlook. While Apple has strengths such as a strong brand and loyal customer base, the current challenges outweigh these positives.
