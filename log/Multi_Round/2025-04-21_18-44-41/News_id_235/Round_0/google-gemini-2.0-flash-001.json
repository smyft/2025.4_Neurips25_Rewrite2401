(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

While the article highlights potential benefits for the tech sector due to reduced regulation and increased AI investment, it also mentions that Big Tech leaders are trying to win the backing of the new administration, suggesting potential challenges or uncertainties. The positive sentiment from Wedbush's Dan Ives, predicting a 25% increase in tech stocks, is a strong bullish signal. However, the article doesn't specifically focus on Apple's individual prospects, instead discussing the tech sector as a whole. Given the potential for reduced regulation and AI investment, but also the uncertainty surrounding the relationship between Big Tech and the Trump administration, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall.
