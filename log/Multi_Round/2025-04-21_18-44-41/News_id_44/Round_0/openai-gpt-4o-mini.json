The news highlights mixed results from other tech companies, with some missing estimates and others exceeding them. This could create a cautious sentiment among investors regarding Apple's performance. Given the anticipation of the earnings report, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising if the report meets or exceeds expectations, but also a significant risk of falling if it disappoints. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, but with considerable risk of a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
