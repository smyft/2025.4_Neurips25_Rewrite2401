      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\nNews Content: Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings miss analysts\u2019 estimates but the stock rises on optimism over the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s growth projections, Microsoft\u2019s Azure growth misses estimates, and Meta\u2019s fourth-quarter profit handily tops forecasts. Apple\u2019s quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell, which typically leads to uncertainty in stock price movement. The news highlights mixed results from other tech companies, with some missing estimates and others exceeding them. This could create a cautious sentiment among investors regarding Apple's performance. Given the anticipation of the earnings report, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising if the report meets or exceeds expectations, but also a significant risk of falling if it disappoints. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, but with considerable risk of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates Apple's earnings report is scheduled for after the closing bell. This means the current stock price movement will be based on speculation and anticipation of the report. The performance of other tech companies mentioned in the article is mixed: Tesla's earnings missed but the stock rose due to growth projections, Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta's profit exceeded expectations. This mixed sentiment creates uncertainty. Given the lack of concrete information about Apple's actual performance, the market reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment and pre-earnings expectations. A slightly positive bias is assumed due to the overall positive market trend and the anticipation of a potentially good report. However, the risk of a negative surprise is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple among several other companies with significant market movements. However, the content only states that Apple's quarterly report is forthcoming.  There is no information in this news snippet to suggest positive or negative impacts on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the assumption of a neutral market reaction before the earnings report is released.  The probabilities are not based on any specific information from this news item, but rather on the general uncertainty before an earnings announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, but it does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or expectations. Given the lack of direct news about Apple's earnings or other material developments, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by broader market sentiment or sector performance rather than company-specific factors. Since the news does not indicate any negative or positive developments for Apple, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards no significant movement. However, the anticipation of the earnings report could lead to slight volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell on Thursday. This indicates that the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by the earnings report. However, the news headline itself does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance. Given that the article mentions other companies' earnings reports, both positive and negative, there is a neutral bias. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are roughly equal, with a slight inclination towards a fall due to potential disappointment in the earnings report, as seen with Tesla and Microsoft.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article does not provide any direct negative or positive information about Apple's financial performance. However, it mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, which may lead to increased volatility in the stock price. The article also discusses the performance of other major tech companies, with some missing estimates and others exceeding them. Given that the news does not contain any specific positive or negative information about Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are uncertain and may be influenced by the overall market sentiment and the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming quarterly report for Apple is creating a sense of uncertainty in the market, as indicated by the mixed performance of other tech companies. While some companies exceeded expectations, others fell short, which could lead to cautious sentiment among investors regarding Apple's performance. Given the anticipation of the earnings report, there is a slightly higher probability of a price rise if the report meets or exceeds expectations, but there is also a significant risk of a fall if it disappoints. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, leading to a slight bias towards a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report, creating uncertainty. Other tech companies had mixed results (Tesla up despite earnings miss, Microsoft down on Azure growth, Meta up on profit). This mixed sentiment makes predicting Apple's stock movement difficult before the report. The previous round of predictions shows a slight bias towards a price rise, but with significant disagreement among the models. Considering the mixed performance of other tech companies and the anticipation surrounding Apple's earnings, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a bit more uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a positive outcome given the general market trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news provides little specific information about Apple's upcoming earnings report.  The mixed performance of other tech companies (Tesla exceeding expectations despite missing earnings, Microsoft's Azure underperforming, Meta exceeding expectations) creates a climate of uncertainty.  The pre-earnings period naturally involves speculation, making precise probability estimation difficult.  However, considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.45 to 0.55 for both rise and fall probabilities, and the general anticipation surrounding Apple's report, a slightly higher probability of a rise is assigned, reflecting the potential for positive surprise.  The lack of concrete negative news also contributes to this assessment.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the consensus and the inherent uncertainty before the earnings announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming quarterly report but does not provide specific details about its performance. The mixed results from other tech companies (Tesla, Microsoft, Meta) create uncertainty in the market. Given the anticipation of Apple's earnings report, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by investor sentiment and pre-earnings expectations. The lack of concrete information suggests a balanced probability, but the overall tech sector's performance could lean slightly positive. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to be slightly higher for a rise, but with significant risk of a fall if the report disappoints.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell on Thursday. The article highlights mixed results from other tech companies, with some missing estimates and others exceeding them. This creates uncertainty regarding Apple's performance. Given the anticipation of the earnings report, there is a potential for the stock price to rise if the report meets or exceeds expectations, but also a risk of falling if it disappoints. The overall sentiment in the tech sector is cautious, but with a slightly positive bias due to the market's anticipation of potentially good reports. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with considerable risk of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance, but it mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, which may lead to increased volatility in the stock price. The article also discusses the performance of other major tech companies, with some missing estimates and others exceeding them. Given the mixed sentiment and lack of concrete information about Apple's actual performance, the market reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment and pre-earnings expectations. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions, but most models assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising or a balanced probability due to the uncertainty and anticipation of the earnings report. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall positive market trend and the anticipation of a potentially good report, but with considerable risk of a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
