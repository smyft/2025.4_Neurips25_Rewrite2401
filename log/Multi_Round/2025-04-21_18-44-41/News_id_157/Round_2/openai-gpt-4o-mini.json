(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from a prominent investor, Ray Dalio, about the high valuations of leading stocks, including those in the Magnificent Seven, which Apple is a part of. Dalio's warning about rising interest rates and the potential for a market correction could lead to negative sentiment among investors. Additionally, the mention of a bloated US debt and the need for diversification suggests a cautious outlook for stocks. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL) and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. Ray Dalio, a respected investor, believes these stocks are expensive and vulnerable to rising interest rates. While Dalio's past predictions haven't always been accurate, his concerns about US debt and the potential for a market rotation away from high-momentum stocks create negative sentiment. The article also mentions other factors weighing on the market, such as high bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars. While the article doesn't specifically target Apple, the general concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven' and the overall market environment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline than an increase in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Ray Dalio, a prominent billionaire investor, expresses concern about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple, citing rising interest rates as a potential headwind.  He mentions the risk of a 'rotation' away from these high-momentum stocks. While he doesn't explicitly mention Apple's specific situation, his general concern about overvalued tech giants and rising interest rates casts a shadow on Apple's near-term prospects.  The news also highlights broader market anxieties, including US debt concerns and potential trade wars, which could negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's stock price.  However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base provide some resilience.  The probability of a price fall is weighted higher due to Dalio's negative outlook and the prevailing market uncertainties, but the probability of a rise isn't zero due to Apple's inherent strength and the possibility that the market may not react as strongly as Dalio predicts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions billionaire investor Ray Dalio warning that stock prices, particularly those of the Magnificent Seven (including Apple), are expensive and inflated. He suggests that a rise in the 10-year yield could negatively impact these stocks. Given Dalio's reputation and the concerns about overvaluation, this news is likely to create negative sentiment around Apple's stock, increasing the probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio expressed concerns that the leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are expensive and could be hit hard if the 10-year yield continues to rise. He emphasized the importance of diversification and warned that being systematically leveraged long could be risky. Given that Dalio's comments are focused on the broader market and specifically mentioned the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple, his remarks could negatively impact investor sentiment towards AAPL. However, the overall market reaction and Apple's stock price movement will also depend on various other factors including company's performance, economic indicators, and other market news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline features billionaire investor Ray Dalio expressing concerns that the stock prices of leading companies, including Apple Inc., are expensive and inflated. Dalio warns that if the 10-year yield continues to rise, these top-momentum names could be hit hard. This warning, combined with Dalio's concerns about the US debt situation and the potential for a period of stagflation, suggests that the stock price of Apple Inc. may fall. However, it's worth noting that Dalio's predictions have not always panned out, and the market's reaction to his warnings is uncertain. Given the negative tone of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Ray Dalio's comments suggest that he believes leading stocks, including Apple, are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates and market rotation. His concern about the US debt situation adds further uncertainty, which could affect investor sentiment. While Apple has strong fundamentals, these broader macroeconomic concerns could lead to short-term volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news from Ray Dalio highlights concerns about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple, and the potential negative impact of rising interest rates. Dalio's warning about the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks being expensive suggests a bearish sentiment, which is compounded by broader market anxieties regarding US debt and economic conditions. Given the consensus among previous predictions indicating a higher probability of a price decline, I estimate a significant likelihood of Apple's stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment from multiple models in the previous round, all assigning a 0.7 probability of a stock price fall, strongly suggests a negative outlook based on Ray Dalio's warnings. Dalio's concerns about high valuations, rising interest rates, and US debt, coupled with the mention of potential market rotation, create a significant headwind for Apple's stock. While Apple is a strong company, the macroeconomic concerns highlighted by Dalio and echoed by other market strategists like Peter Oppenheimer outweigh any potential positive factors in the short term. The consensus from the previous round reinforces the likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: Ray Dalio's statement carries significant weight due to his reputation and experience.  His concern about overvalued 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, coupled with worries about rising interest rates and US debt, paints a bearish picture.  The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price fall. While Apple's inherent strength and potential for resilience exist, the immediate impact of Dalio's warning, combined with the broader market anxieties mentioned (high bond yields, strong dollar, potential trade wars), suggests a higher likelihood of a short-term price decline.  The previous predictions consistently show a probability of a price fall between 0.7 and 0.75, which I will adjust slightly to account for Apple's inherent strength and the possibility of a less severe market reaction than Dalio predicts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple, which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven'. Dalio warns that rising interest rates could negatively impact these stocks, and his comments about the US debt situation add to the negative sentiment. While Apple has strong fundamentals, the broader macroeconomic concerns and Dalio's reputation suggest a higher probability of a short-term decline in Apple's stock price. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a fall, aligning with the negative outlook presented in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL) and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks.

Ray Dalio, a respected investor, believes these stocks are expensive and vulnerable to rising interest rates. While Dalio's past predictions haven't always been accurate, his concerns about US debt and the potential for a market rotation away from high-momentum stocks create negative sentiment. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which also indicate a higher probability of a stock price decline, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from Ray Dalio, a well-respected investor, about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple. Dalio warns that rising interest rates could negatively impact these stocks. His concerns about the US debt situation and the potential for a market rotation further contribute to the negative sentiment. Previous predictions from various models also indicate a higher probability of a stock price decline. Despite Apple's strong fundamentals, the prevailing market uncertainties and the general bearish sentiment suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
