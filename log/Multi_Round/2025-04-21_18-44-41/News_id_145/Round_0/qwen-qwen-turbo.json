StockBrokers.com Director of Investor Research Jessica Inskip sits down with the Market Domination Overtime team to talk about navigating options trades in the mega-cap tech sector.\n\n\"We tend to look at the market as an up and down perspective. When we utilize options from an analysis perspective, since we have an expiration date, we can get an idea of path which gives us a range of a deviation which just is expecting from the Magnificent seven large move,\" Inskip says. \"But those large moves are up and down.\"\n\nInskip shares with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton her own approach when it comes to \"synthetic\" long positions around Amazon (AMZN).\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The focus on large moves both up and down suggests volatility but does not provide specific guidance on any individual stock within this group. Since there's no direct mention of Apple Inc.
