Vorrath's extensive experience with Apple's products and her role in managing significant software projects could help address AI challenges and enhance Siri, potentially leading to improved user experience and competitiveness. However, Apple has faced setbacks in AI and lags behind rivals, which might temper investor expectations. The recent integration of ChatGPT with Siri is a step forward, but it may not immediately change the competitive landscape.
