(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the importance of upcoming earnings results and CEO commentary regarding capital expenditures (CapEx) in the tech sector, particularly for AI development. While there is a general positive sentiment towards large-cap growth, there is also caution due to uncertainties surrounding AI models and spending commitments. Given that Apple is part of the Big Tech group and will be influenced by the overall market sentiment, the probabilities reflect a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to the anticipation of positive earnings and CapEx discussions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI-related capital expenditure (capex) for Big Tech companies, including Apple. While the article doesn't directly mention Apple's earnings, it highlights that CEO commentary on capex commitment and the perceived importance of high-end AI chips (like those from Nvidia) will be crucial. A strong commitment to AI capex could be viewed positively by investors, suggesting future growth and innovation. However, uncertainty surrounding new AI models (DeepSeek) and their efficiency introduces a note of caution. Since the article doesn't provide specific information about Apple's AI strategy or capex plans, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive sentiment towards large-cap growth and the potential for positive CEO commentary, there's a slightly higher probability of a price rise. However, the uncertainty surrounding AI model efficiency and the lack of specific Apple-related information temper this optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Big Tech's capital expenditure (CapEx) on AI, particularly mentioning the importance of CEO commentary regarding AI investments and the use of high-end Nvidia chips.  Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news.  The article highlights the importance of earnings and CEO guidance for other tech companies, but doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's AI investments or financial performance. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minimal.  The overall market sentiment (influenced by Fed decisions and other tech earnings) will likely have a much larger impact on AAPL than this specific news piece. We assume a neutral stance, with slightly higher probability of a price movement following the broader market trends rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the importance of AI-related capital expenditures (capex) and CEO commentary during earnings calls for Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on AI investments and CEO commitment to these expenditures suggests potential positive sentiment if Apple reaffirms its commitment to AI development. However, the lack of clarity on DeepSeek's new AI model introduces some uncertainty. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and its historical performance, the market may react positively to any reaffirmation of AI investments, but the overall impact is tempered by broader market uncertainty and the Fed's interest rate decision.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on the importance of AI-related capital expenditures for Big Tech companies, with a specific emphasis on CEO commentary regarding commitment to CapEx spend and the role of high-end Nvidia chips in their development. Apple's stock price movement is likely influenced by the broader market trends and the emphasis on AI-related spending. Given that Apple's competitors, such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are releasing their earnings results and that AI and CapEx spending are crucial for the company's future growth, there, there seems to be a cautiously optimistic view towards Apple's stock. However, the lack of direct mention of Apple in the context of the news about AI capex and the fact that the article does not provide specific information about Apple's earnings or spending plans, suggests that the stock price movement is more uncertain. The emphasis on CEO commentary and the commitment to CapEx spending could imply a positive outlook if Apple's CEO shows strong commitment to AI-related investments, but it also depends on how investors perceive the company's spending and growth strategy relative to its peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the importance of Big Tech's AI capital expenditures (capex) in addition to their earnings results. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned as one of the companies releasing earnings results, the article implies that the overall trend of Big Tech's AI investments will impact the market. Stuart Kaiser's commentary suggests that CEO commentary on capex spend and commitment to AI development will be crucial. Given Apple's significant investments in AI and its position as a leader in the tech industry, the market may react positively to any indication of continued commitment to AI development. However, the lack of clarity on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency, as well as the cautious tone from Kaiser, may introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the article suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook for Big Tech, including Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
