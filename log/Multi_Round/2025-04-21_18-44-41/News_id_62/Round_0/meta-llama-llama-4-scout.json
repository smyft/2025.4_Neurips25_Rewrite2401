(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

Apple's stock price movement is likely influenced by the broader market trends and the emphasis on AI-related spending. Given that Apple's competitors, such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are releasing their earnings results and that AI and CapEx spending are crucial for the company's future growth, there, there seems to be a cautiously optimistic view towards Apple's stock. However, the lack of direct mention of Apple in the context of the news about AI capex and the fact that the article does not provide specific information about Apple's earnings or spending plans, suggests that the stock price movement is more uncertain. The emphasis on CEO commentary and the commitment to CapEx spending could imply a positive outlook if Apple's CEO shows strong commitment to AI-related investments, but it also depends on how investors perceive the company's spending and growth strategy relative to its peers.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
