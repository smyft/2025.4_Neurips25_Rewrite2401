(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

While the article doesn't directly mention Apple's earnings, it highlights that CEO commentary on capex commitment and the perceived importance of high-end AI chips (like those from Nvidia) will be crucial. A strong commitment to AI capex could be viewed positively by investors, suggesting future growth and innovation. However, uncertainty surrounding new AI models (DeepSeek) and their efficiency introduces a note of caution. Since the article doesn't provide specific information about Apple's AI strategy or capex plans, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive sentiment towards large-cap growth and the potential for positive CEO commentary, there's a slightly higher probability of a price rise. However, the uncertainty surrounding AI model efficiency and the lack of specific Apple-related information temper this optimism.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
