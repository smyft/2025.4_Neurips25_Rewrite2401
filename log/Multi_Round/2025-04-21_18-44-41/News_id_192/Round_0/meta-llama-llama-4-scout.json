(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung \u2018doubles down\u2019 on AI tools with new S25 Series smartphones\nNews Content: Samsung has unveiled its new range of flagship smartphones, complete with upgrades to its AI tools that the firm says make the technology more of a \u201ccompanion\u201d.\n\nThe Korean phone maker confirmed the new Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra would go on sale on February 7.\n\nAt the heart of the new devices is what Samsung says is a substantial array of updates to its Galaxy AI features \u2013 including new abilities to work across different apps quickly to carry out tasks and the built-in AI being able to better understand the context of what a user is looking at on their phone at that moment.\n\nOne industry expert said the firm was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on the technology and had made \u201cclever enhancements\u201d to try and entice more consumers to upgrade or switch to Samsung.\n\nAI tools have become a key arms race in the smartphone market, with Samsung first launching its tools in January last year, followed by Google, Apple and others later in the year.\n\nAs part of its latest updates, Samsung said users will be able to make more complex and multi-layered requests \u2013 for example asking the built-in Google Gemini AI assistant to find a football team\u2019s fixtures online and then add them to a user\u2019s calendar \u2013 in a single command using text or their voice.\n\nSamsung has a close partnership with Google, as a user of its Android operating system on its smartphones, and said its enhanced AI tools would be able to work across all native Samsung and Google apps because of this partnership, as well as some third-party apps such as Spotify.\n\nAnother Google-made tool, Circle to Search \u2013 where users can draw around an item on screen they want to search for \u2013 has also been updated for the S25 and can now recognise phone numbers, email and web addresses on a user\u2019s screen.\n\nIn addition, Samsung has introduced new context-driven features called the Now Brief and Now Bar to the S25 series, which proactively gives users summaries, updates and app suggestions based on their usage and habits throughout the day.As well as enhanced AI tools, the S25 Series includes improved cameras and processors (Samsung)\n\nAnnika Bizon, director of mobile experience at Samsung UK and Ireland, said: \u201cModern life is hard. Balancing work and home is incredibly overwhelming, and we\u2019re all looking for ways to help us juggle life\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point now where AI has evolved to become a companion \u2013 it\u2019s knowing intuitively what you need, and when. It\u2019s lightening your load so you can focus on the things that matter, at your own pace.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s becoming a pocket personal assistant for people, helping you manage your to-do lists.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which it\u2019s changing how we live is astonishing.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a year into Galaxy AI and it\u2019s rolling out nearly up to eight times faster than the internet when it first launched in Britain \u2013 which is something we all use every day.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed the S25 would start at \u00a3979, the S25+ at \u00a3999 and the S25 Ultra \u2013 which comes with Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus built-in \u2013 would start at \u00a31,249.\n\nIndustry expert and analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight said Samsung was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on AI with some \u201cclever enhancements\u201d in the S25 range, but said some consumers were still to be convinced by the technology.\n\n\u201cLaunching new flagship smartphones has become a considerable headache for all the leading smartphone manufacturers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTop-end products are now so good that it\u2019s extremely difficult to deliver any meaningful differentiation from one year to the next. Samsung is not alone in this challenge, with Apple and all the other Android smartphone manufacturers in the same boat.\n\n\u201cLaunches are now characterised by \u2018slightly better everything\u2019, be that screen technology, battery life, processor performance, camera specs and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s little surprise that phone makers are hoping that a little \u2018AI magic dust\u2019 will help turn consumers heads, but that\u2019s proving to be a tough sell too.\n\n\u201cAt a time when improvements to hardware capabilities and product design are largely incremental, Samsung is doubling down on its AI story.\n\n\u201cThere are some clever enhancements included in the Galaxy S25 line-up, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be enough to have consumers rushing out to upgrade their phones prematurely.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is far from being a unique issue for Samsung. Apple is facing the same challenges with the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. AI is a boon for someone who needs an upgrade, but not enough to move the needle for consumers who have a relatively up-to-date phone already.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
