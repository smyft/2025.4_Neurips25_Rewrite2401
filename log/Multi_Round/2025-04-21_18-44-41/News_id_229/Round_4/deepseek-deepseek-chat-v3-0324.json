(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance. Yahoo Finance host Rachelle Akuffo joins the program to acknowledge several of the Big Tech CEOs at Trump's swearing-in, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta Platforms' (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) chief executive, and even TikTok president Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAhead of the January 20 ceremony, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang stated he will be out of the country but \"look[s] forward to congratulating the Trump administration when they take office.\"\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests a strong relationship between the tech industry and the government. This could lead to optimism about potential favorable policies for tech companies. However, the political context and public sentiment towards Trump and his administration could also create uncertainty. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. If investors believe this signals a potentially favorable regulatory or business environment for Apple under the Trump administration, it could lead to a slight increase in stock price. Conversely, if investors perceive this as a negative signal (e.g., potential for increased scrutiny or policy changes that could harm Apple), it could lead to a slight decrease. Given the limited information and the generally neutral nature of attending an inauguration, the probabilities are close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived favorable business conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret the presence of tech CEOs at a Trump inauguration as potentially positive (depending on their political leanings and Trump's policies), it's unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The market generally reacts more strongly to concrete policy changes or financial announcements than to symbolic events like inaugurations.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. Any movement is more likely to be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, alongside other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of tech leaders at such events can be interpreted as a sign of potential collaboration or favorable policies for the tech industry under the new administration. However, the market's reaction to political events can be unpredictable, and the impact on Apple's stock price may depend on broader investor sentiment. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, there is a modest probability of a stock price rise due to perceived stability or positive regulatory outlook. Conversely, the probability of a fall is lower, as there are no immediate negative implications from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article mentions the presence of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, but it does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or future plans that could directly influence its stock price. The presence of tech CEOs at a political event may not necessarily have a direct impact on the stock price movement of Apple or other mentioned companies. The news is more about the attendance of tech leaders at a political event rather than any company-specific announcements or developments that could influence stock price movement. Therefore, based on this information alone, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement of Apple (AAPL) is likely to be neutral or not significantly affected by this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article mentions the attendance of Apple's CEO at the Trump inauguration, along with other Big Tech CEOs. This event is neutral and does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or strategies. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration may be seen as a sign of the company's interest in maintaining relationships with the new administration, but it does not necessarily imply any positive or negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the overall market sentiment and reaction to the inauguration and the new administration's policies may influence the stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is largely uncertain and dependent on other market factors. Therefore, a moderate probability of stock price rise or fall is assigned, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for market volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a potential for favorable policies for the tech industry. However, the political context and public sentiment towards Trump could create uncertainty. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a slight positive sentiment. Given the neutral nature of the news and the lack of specific financial implications, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise, while the probability of a fall remains relatively low due to the absence of negative implications.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration alongside other tech leaders. This event, by itself, is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight leaning towards a positive reaction, as some models suggest potential favorable policies for tech companies. However, the political context and public sentiment towards Trump could also create uncertainty. Given the mixed signals and the neutral nature of the event, I'll adjust the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance, while still acknowledging the potential for a slightly positive reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is largely neutral.  While it could be interpreted positively by some as signifying good relations with the administration and potentially favorable policies, it's unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, clustering around a roughly 50/50 chance of a price increase or decrease.  The lack of concrete information about Apple itself in the news reinforces the neutral stance.  The market's overall reaction to the inauguration and the new administration's policies will likely be a far more significant factor than this single event.  Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50/50, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration, alongside other Big Tech CEOs. This event is largely symbolic and does not provide any direct financial or operational impact on Apple. Market reactions to such political events are typically neutral unless accompanied by specific policy announcements affecting the company. Given the lack of concrete details about potential policies or business impacts, the event is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price. The probabilities are therefore balanced, with a slight edge towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, alongside other Big Tech CEOs. This event is neutral in nature and does not provide specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or future plans. The presence of tech leaders at such an event can be interpreted as a sign of potential collaboration or favorable policies for the tech industry under the new administration. However, the market's reaction to political events can be unpredictable, and the impact on Apple's stock price may depend on broader investor sentiment. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, there is a modest probability of a stock price rise due to perceived stability or positive regulatory outlook. Conversely, the probability of a fall is lower, as there are no immediate negative implications from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at the Trump inauguration, which is a neutral event. The presence of tech CEOs at a political event may not necessarily have a direct impact on the stock price movement of Apple. However, the overall market sentiment and reaction to the inauguration and the new administration's policies may influence the stock price. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the varied predictions from other models, I assign a moderate probability to both stock price rise and fall, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for market volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. While the attendance itself does not provide explicit information about Apple's financial performance or strategic moves, it can be interpreted in various ways by the market. Some might view it positively, suggesting a strong relationship with the new administration and potential favorable policies. However, others might see it as neutral or potentially negative due to the uncertain political climate. Given the mixed signals and the historical neutral responses to similar events, the probability of a significant stock price movement is low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration is a largely symbolic event that does not provide direct financial implications for the company. While some investors may interpret this as a sign of potential collaboration or favorable policies for the tech industry, the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the political context surrounding Trump's administration. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a positive sentiment. However, the lack of concrete information about Apple's performance or future plans suggests that the stock price movement is likely to be limited. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise, while the probability of a fall remains relatively low due to the absence of negative implications.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is largely a neutral event. While it could signal potential collaboration or favorable policies, it lacks concrete financial implications. Previous predictions varied, clustering around a 50/50 chance of price increase or decrease. Considering the lack of specific financial information and the potential for market volatility based on broader reactions to the inauguration, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50/50. The trend in previous rounds shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is largely neutral.

Considering the lack of concrete positive or negative implications and the consensus towards a neutral reaction in previous rounds, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50/50, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the inherent uncertainty.  The slight lean towards a rise reflects the possibility of some investors interpreting the CEO's presence as a positive signal, however weak.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 inauguration, which is a largely symbolic event without direct financial implications for Apple. While the presence of tech leaders at such an event could be interpreted as a positive signal regarding potential favorable policies, the market's reaction is unpredictable and typically neutral unless accompanied by specific policy announcements.
