A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests a strong relationship between the tech industry and the government. This could lead to optimism about potential favorable policies for tech companies. However, the political context and public sentiment towards Trump and his administration could also create uncertainty. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. If investors believe this signals a potentially favorable regulatory or business environment for Apple under the Trump administration, it could lead to a slight increase in stock price. Conversely, if investors perceive this as a negative signal (e.g., potential for increased scrutiny or policy changes that could harm Apple), it could lead to a slight decrease. Given the limited information and the generally neutral nature of attending an inauguration, the probabilities are close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived favorable business conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret the presence of tech CEOs at a Trump inauguration as potentially positive (depending on their political leanings and Trump's policies), it's unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The market generally reacts more strongly to concrete policy changes or financial announcements than to symbolic events like inaugurations.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. Any movement is more likely to be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, alongside other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of tech leaders at such events can be interpreted as a sign of potential collaboration or favorable policies for the tech industry under the new administration. However, the market's reaction to political events can be unpredictable, and the impact on Apple's stock price may depend on broader investor sentiment. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, there is a modest probability of a stock price rise due to perceived stability or positive regulatory outlook. Conversely, the probability of a fall is lower, as there are no immediate negative implications from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article mentions the presence of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, but it does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or future plans that could directly influence its stock price. The presence of tech CEOs at a political event may not necessarily have a direct impact on the stock price movement of Apple or other mentioned companies. The news is more about the attendance of tech leaders at a political event rather than any company-specific announcements or developments that could influence stock price movement. Therefore, based on this information alone, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement of Apple (AAPL) is likely to be neutral or not significantly affected by this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article mentions the attendance of Apple's CEO at the Trump inauguration, along with other Big Tech CEOs. This event is neutral and does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or strategies. The presence of Apple's CEO at the inauguration may be seen as a sign of the company's interest in maintaining relationships with the new administration, but it does not necessarily imply any positive or negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the overall market sentiment and reaction to the inauguration and the new administration's policies may influence the stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is largely uncertain and dependent on other market factors. Therefore, a moderate probability of stock price rise or fall is assigned, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for market volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
