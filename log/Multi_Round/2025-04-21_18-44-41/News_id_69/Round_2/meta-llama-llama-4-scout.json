(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Gets Another Downgrade on iPhone Risk Ahead of Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was downgraded to perform from outperform at Oppenheimer, in the latest sign of caution building ahead of the company\u2019s results.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThis is at least the fifth downgrade Apple has received this month, following cuts from Jefferies, MoffettNathanson, Loop Capital, and DBS Bank. The cuts cement Apple\u2019s status as the least-loved megacap except Tesla Inc.\n\nLike the others, Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang cited concerns over iPhone sales in the downgrade, seeing \u201ca twofold challenge ahead for iPhone growth,\u201d including greater competition in China and a \u201clack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to accelerate near-term device replacement.\u201d\n\nIndependent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nShares fell 1.3% on Wednesday. While it remains down 9% from a December record, the stock is coming off a two-day gain of 7%, its largest two-day rally since June. This week\u2019s gain reflects how the emergence of China\u2019s artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek is seen as a positive for Apple, even as it weighed on tech broadly.\n\nApple reports its first-quarter results after the close on Thursday.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition further supports a bearish outlook. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall sentiment appears negative ahead of the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Several downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of compelling AI features are significant negatives. Independent research confirms a substantial decline in iPhone sales in China. However, the stock has recently experienced a two-day rally, possibly driven by the emergence of China's AI startup DeepSeek, which is seen as a positive for Apple. The overall sentiment leans negative due to the downgrades and sales concerns, but the recent rally and potential AI benefits introduce some uncertainty. Considering the negative sentiment from multiple downgrades and confirmed sales decline, I'm giving a higher probability to a stock price fall. The recent rally is likely a temporary correction and the underlying issues remain.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant amount of negative sentiment surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report. Multiple downgrades from analysts, citing concerns about weakening iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, paint a bearish picture.  While a recent two-day rally suggests some positive market sentiment related to AI developments, the overwhelming negative pre-earnings sentiment from analysts outweighs this. The fact that Apple is considered the 'least-loved megacap' except for Tesla further reinforces the negative outlook.  The 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter is a substantial figure and a key driver of the negative predictions.  While the market reaction to the news is already partially reflected in the 1.3% drop on Wednesday, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise given the confluence of negative factors and the upcoming earnings report, which could potentially confirm or exacerbate these concerns. However, the probability of a rise isn't zero, as positive surprises in the earnings report or further positive AI-related news could still drive the price up.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades for Apple Inc. due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and lack of compelling AI features to drive device replacement. The stock has already seen a decline and recent gains are tied to broader market movements rather than company-specific positives. Given the negative sentiment from analysts and the upcoming earnings report, there is heightened risk of further downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the company's stock. The analyst cited challenges in iPhone growth, including increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI apps. Historically, downgrades and negative analyst sentiments can lead to decreased investor confidence and, consequently, a drop in stock price. Given that the stock has already fallen 1.3% on the day of the news and is down 9% from its December record, there's a higher likelihood of the stock price continuing to fall rather than rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock by Oppenheimer, citing concerns over iPhone sales due to increased competition in China and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps. This is the fifth downgrade Apple has received this month, indicating a growing caution among analysts ahead of the company's results. Additionally, independent research shows an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter and a 5% global unit sales fall. However, the stock has seen a recent two-day gain of 7%, its largest since June, possibly due to the emergence of China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek being seen as a positive for Apple. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment seems negative, but the recent stock gain and potential positive impacts from AI developments suggest a balanced outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about the company's iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition further supports a bearish outlook. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall sentiment remains negative ahead of the earnings report. The significant drop in iPhone sales in China and the lack of compelling AI features contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans heavily towards a negative outlook for Apple's stock due to multiple downgrades, concerns about iPhone sales (especially in China), and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. While there was a recent two-day rally, it's likely a temporary correction. The upcoming earnings report is a significant catalyst, and given the negative sentiment, a disappointing report could trigger a further decline. The previous predictions consistently favored a higher probability of the stock falling. Considering the trend and the weight of negative factors, I will slightly adjust the probabilities but maintain the overall bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Multiple downgrades from reputable firms cite weakening iPhone sales, especially in the crucial Chinese market.  The reported 18.2% drop in Chinese iPhone sales during the December quarter is a significant concern. While a recent two-day rally might suggest some short-term optimism (possibly linked to the DeepSeek AI development), this is likely a temporary blip against the backdrop of substantial negative sentiment. The lack of compelling AI applications to drive device upgrades is another significant headwind.  The upcoming earnings report is a major catalyst for potential further price movement, and given the current negative outlook, a negative surprise is more likely than a positive one.  While the probability of a rise isn't zero (positive earnings surprise or further AI-related positive news could occur), the weight of evidence strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall.  The previous predictions also largely support this bearish outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades for Apple Inc. due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of compelling AI features to drive device replacement.

However, the recent two-day gain of 7% and potential positive impacts from AI developments introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment seems negative, but not entirely dismissive of potential positive surprises in the earnings report or further positive AI-related news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock by Oppenheimer, citing concerns over iPhone sales due to increased competition in China and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps.

Despite recent gains, the overall sentiment remains bearish, supported by the historical trend of negative analyst opinions leading to stock price declines. Moreover, the upcoming earnings report could exacerbate concerns if it does not meet expectations or further confirms the downward trends. However, there is a small possibility of positive surprise or market optimism influencing the stock price positively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
