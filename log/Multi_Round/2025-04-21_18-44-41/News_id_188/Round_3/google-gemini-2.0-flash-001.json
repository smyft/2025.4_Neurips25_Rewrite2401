(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is set to launch an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar product. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. Historically, news of competition from Samsung has led to negative sentiment towards Apple stock, especially if consumers perceive Samsung's offering as superior or more innovative. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model may mitigate some of the negative impact. Overall, the competitive landscape suggests a higher probability of stock price decline than increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's expected ultrathin iPhone. This could negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term as it suggests a loss of competitive advantage and innovation leadership in a key product category. However, Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, mitigating some of the negative impact. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as Samsung is first to market with this new form factor. The market's reaction will also depend on the actual features, pricing, and consumer reception of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Given that Apple is a large, diversified company, the impact of a single product launch by a competitor is unlikely to be drastic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is beating Apple to market with an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge. While this might seem negative for Apple at first glance, the article also states that Apple is planning its own ultrathin iPhone later in the year.  The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore likely to be muted.  The news doesn't suggest a significant market share shift or a major technological disadvantage for Apple.  The success of the ultrathin phone market segment remains uncertain, and Apple's established brand loyalty and ecosystem are significant strengths.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is relatively low, with the market likely already pricing in the competitive landscape.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is set to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to market in this category. While Apple is also expected to release a similar ultrathin iPhone later in the year, the immediate impact of Samsung's announcement could create short-term negative sentiment for Apple's stock. Investors might perceive this as a competitive threat, especially given Apple's past struggles with new phone sizes (e.g., mini and Plus models). However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin iPhone could mitigate some of the negative impact. The probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to the near-term competitive pressure, but the long-term outlook remains neutral to positive given Apple's track record.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category. This could potentially impact Apple's market share and investor confidence in Apple's ability to innovate and compete. However, Apple is still expected to launch its own ultrathin iPhone later this year, which might mitigate the negative impact. The news might create short-term uncertainty but does not fundamentally alter Apple's long-term prospects. Given this, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower, while the probability of it falling is higher but not drastically so, as the market may already have priced in expectations of new iPhone releases.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market, which might negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also worth noting that Apple is expected to launch its own ultrathin iPhone later this year, which could mitigate the impact of Samsung's move. Additionally, the fact that Samsung's new phone will be priced lower than its Ultra model could make it more attractive to customers, further potentially affecting Apple's sales and stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung will release an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone ahead of Apple. This could potentially draw market attention and consumer interest towards Samsung's product, thereby affecting Apple's potential sales if consumers prefer Samsung's offering. However, Apple is also planning to release an ultrathin version later in the year, which could counteract any immediate negative impact. Therefore, the immediate reaction might be negative, but there could be a long-term neutral effect once Apple releases its version.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Samsung launching the Galaxy S25 Edge ultrathin phone ahead of Apple's anticipated release creates immediate competitive pressure on Apple. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, as it suggests a potential loss of market share and innovation leadership for Apple in a key product category. While Apple is expected to release its own ultrathin model later in the year, the timing of Samsung's launch may impact short-term investor confidence. Given the historical context of competition from Samsung and the mixed reactions from previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline due to the immediate competitive threat, despite Apple's strong brand loyalty and future product plans.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to Samsung's earlier launch of an ultrathin phone. While Apple is expected to release a similar product later, the first-mover advantage for Samsung and the potential for consumers to be drawn to Samsung's offering in the short term are key concerns. The fact that Samsung's phone will be priced lower than its Ultra model could further impact Apple's sales. However, Apple's brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model could mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the potential for short-term negative sentiment, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about Samsung beating Apple to market with an ultrathin phone is likely to cause a short-term negative reaction in Apple's stock price.  However, the impact is likely to be muted due to several factors.  First, Apple is also expected to release its own ultrathin iPhone later in the year. Second, the success of this new phone form factor is uncertain. Third, Apple's strong brand loyalty and established ecosystem provide a significant buffer against short-term competitive pressures.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the mitigating factors and the fact that the market likely anticipates Apple's response, the probability of a significant price drop is lower than some initial reactions might suggest.  The short-term negative sentiment is likely to be temporary, and the long-term impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin Galaxy S25 Edge ahead of Apple's anticipated ultrathin iPhone, which could create short-term competitive pressure on Apple. Historically, such competitive moves have led to negative sentiment towards Apple's stock, especially if perceived as a technological lag. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model later this year may mitigate some of the immediate negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price decline is slightly higher than a rise, but not drastically so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar ultrathin iPhone. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model later in the year may mitigate some of the negative impact. The overall sentiment from various predictions suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, but the impact is expected to be moderate. Based on the analysis, the estimated probability of Apple's stock price rising is 0.35, and the probability of it falling is 0.65.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's expected ultrathin iPhone. This could create competitive pressure on Apple, potentially impacting its market share and sales in the premium smartphone segment. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model may mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly higher probability of stock price fall than rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 for the probability of fall, and 0.3 to 0.45 for the probability of rise. Given the consistency of this trend and the fact that Apple is a large, diversified company, the impact of a single product launch by a competitor is unlikely to be drastic. Therefore, the estimated probabilities are closer to the average of the previous predictions, with a slightly higher probability of stock price fall than rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple, potentially putting competitive pressure on Apple. However, Apple is also planning to release a similar ultrathin iPhone later in the year, which could mitigate the initial negative reaction. The market perception will likely be influenced by the features, pricing, and consumer reception of Samsung's new product. Despite the competitive challenge, Apple's strong brand loyalty and existing ecosystem may help stabilize the stock price over the long term.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Samsung launching the Galaxy S25 Edge ultrathin phone ahead of Apple's anticipated release creates immediate competitive pressure on Apple. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, as it suggests a potential loss of market share and innovation leadership for Apple in a key product category. While Apple is expected to release its own ultrathin model later in the year, the timing of Samsung's launch may impact short-term investor confidence.

While Apple's own ultrathin iPhone is anticipated later in the year, the immediate competitive pressure and potential for Samsung to capture initial market share weigh negatively on investor sentiment. Apple's strong brand and ecosystem provide some buffer, but the first-mover advantage and potentially lower pricing of the Samsung device contribute to the likelihood of a short-term stock price decline. The previous rounds show a consensus around a 0.6-0.7 probability of a fall, and I will align with that trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news that Samsung is releasing an ultrathin phone before Apple creates short-term negative pressure.  However, Apple's own ultrathin iPhone release later in the year, its strong brand loyalty, and the overall uncertainty of the success of this new phone form factor mitigate the potential negative impact.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.  While the first-mover advantage for Samsung is a concern, Apple's established market position and future product release suggest the impact will be less severe than initially feared.  Considering the mitigating factors and the consensus from previous predictions, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly towards a more negative outlook than a purely neutral one, but still acknowledging the potential for a muted response.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, ahead of Apple's anticipated release of a similar ultrathin iPhone.
