(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jefferies Cuts Apple Rating, Flags iPhone Weakness and Slower AI Growth\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares continue to decline following a Jefferies downgrade to Underperform from Hold, driven by concerns about slowing iPhone demand and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also cut its price target to $200.75 from $211.84.\n\nJefferies analysts, led by Edison Lee, predict Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target of 5% and guide for minimal growth in Q2, falling below consensus estimates. Slower AI adoption and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for future iPhones add to the concern.\n\nNew data from IDC shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, while subsidies in China are expected to exclude most iPhone models due to pricing limits, potentially dampening demand. Meanwhile, Apple's budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives, limiting its potential.\n\nAs of 11:07 AM ET, Apple shares traded at $221.25, down 3.80%, reflecting growing investor worries. Earlier in premarket trading, shares were already down 2%. Apple is set to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on January 30, with expectations closely watched amid these challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade by Jefferies to 'Underperform' and the concerns about slowing iPhone demand and AI growth are significant negative indicators for Apple. The cut in price target and the prediction of missing revenue growth targets further contribute to bearish sentiment. Additionally, the decline in iPhone shipments and potential competition for the budget iPhone SE4 add to the challenges. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, broader consumer electronics headwinds, and slower AI growth. They also lowered the price target. Data from IDC shows a decline in iPhone shipments. Subsidies in China are expected to exclude iPhones, further dampening demand. The budget iPhone SE4 faces tough competition. The stock is already down significantly. While earnings are upcoming, the negative sentiment and concrete data points suggest further downside risk. The market has already reacted negatively, indicating a strong consensus view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies, a reputable financial firm, has downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' citing concerns about weakening iPhone demand, slower-than-expected AI integration, and broader economic headwinds.  The reduced price target of $200.75 is significantly below the current trading price, indicating a bearish outlook.  Supporting this negative outlook is the reported 4% year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments and the potential impact of Chinese subsidy limitations.  While Apple's Q1 earnings report could potentially offer a counter-narrative, the current news strongly suggests a higher probability of a price decline in the short term. The pre-market drop and intraday decline further reinforce this negative sentiment. However, it's important to note that Apple is a large, established company, and the market reaction might not fully reflect the long-term prospects.  Therefore, while a price fall is more likely in the immediate future, a small probability of a rise is still possible due to potential positive surprises in the upcoming earnings report or overall market sentiment shifts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, and challenges in AI adoption and competition. The immediate market reaction shows a 3.80% decline in stock price, indicating strong investor concerns. Given the downgrade, reduced price target, and broader industry headwinds, the probability of further stock price decline is elevated in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to a downgrade by Jefferies to Underperform from Hold. The downgrade is driven by concerns over slowing iPhone demand, weaker consumer electronics trends, potential misses in revenue growth targets, and slower AI growth. Additionally, data showing a 4% year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments in Q1 and potential competition for the budget iPhone SE4 further contribute to the negative sentiment. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's rating by Jefferies due to concerns about slowing iPhone demand and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also cut its price target, predicting Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target. Additionally, data shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, and the budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition. These factors contribute to a negative outlook, increasing the likelihood of the stock price falling. However, it's essential to consider that the stock market can be unpredictable, and other factors may influence the stock price. Given the current information, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news from Jefferies includes a downgrade of Apple's rating and a reduction in their price target, which has led to a decline in Apple's stock price. Concerns over weakening iPhone demand and slower AI growth have been expressed, alongside a prediction that Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target. Additionally, recent data showing a decrease in iPhone shipments and potential competition from used iPhone models and Android alternatives further complicate the outlook. These factors suggest a negative sentiment among investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade by Jefferies to 'Underperform' and the concerns about slowing iPhone demand and AI growth are significant negative indicators for Apple. The cut in price target and the prediction of missing revenue growth targets further contribute to bearish sentiment. Additionally, the decline in iPhone shipments and potential competition for the budget iPhone SE4 add to the challenges. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from Jefferies' downgrade, price target cut, and concerns about iPhone demand and AI growth, coupled with the actual decline in iPhone shipments, strongly suggests a bearish outlook. The stock is already down significantly, and the previous predictions overwhelmingly favor a price decrease. While a slight chance of a positive surprise exists, the weight of negative indicators points towards further decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The overwhelming consensus among the previous models and the news itself points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade, lowered price target, declining iPhone shipments, concerns about AI growth, and competitive pressures all contribute to a negative outlook.  While Apple's Q1 earnings could potentially offer a positive surprise, the current information strongly suggests a bearish sentiment. The market's immediate reaction (a significant drop in share price) further reinforces this.  The previous models' predictions, while varying slightly, consistently show a much higher probability of a price fall than a rise.  I am adjusting the probabilities slightly upward from the previous models' average to account for the possibility of a positive surprise in the upcoming earnings report, but the overall negative sentiment remains dominant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant negative indicators for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies to 'Underperform' due to concerns about slowing iPhone demand, slower AI growth, and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also reduced its price target to $200.75 from $211.84, predicting Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target. Additional data shows a 4% year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments, and potential competition for the budget iPhone SE4. The stock has already declined by 3.80% intraday, reflecting strong investor concerns. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term. However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30 could potentially offer a counter-narrative, though the current sentiment is overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc.

Multiple models have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling based on these factors, with probabilities ranging between 0.75 and 0.85.
