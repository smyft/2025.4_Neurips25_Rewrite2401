While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the fact that the news focuses on his purchase of another AI stock, rather than any negative news about Apple itself, suggests a limited impact on Apple's stock price.  The market is likely already pricing in much of the information about Apple's performance and future prospects. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) solely due to this news is low.  A slight downward pressure is possible due to the news of a large investor selling, but this effect is likely to be temporary and minor.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```\n"
