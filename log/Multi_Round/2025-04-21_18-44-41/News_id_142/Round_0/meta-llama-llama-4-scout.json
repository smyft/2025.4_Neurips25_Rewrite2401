The sale of Apple stock by a prominent investor could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple's stock price. However, the news is more about Cohen's investment shift rather than a direct criticism or negative development specific to Apple. Given this context, there might be a slight inclination towards a negative impact, but it's also possible that the market could interpret this as a neutral or even positive event if Cohen's move is seen as a strategic reallocation of assets.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
