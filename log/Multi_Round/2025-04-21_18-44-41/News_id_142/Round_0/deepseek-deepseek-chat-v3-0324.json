This could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance or a strategic shift towards higher-growth opportunities. While Cohen's move might influence some investors to reconsider their positions in Apple, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited unless this signals a broader trend among institutional investors. Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diversified product portfolio may mitigate negative sentiment. However, the news could still create short-term downward pressure.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
