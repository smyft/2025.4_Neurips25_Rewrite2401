However, the headline alone lacks specifics.  Without knowing the underlying reasons cited in the article's content (which is missing), it's impossible to assign precise probabilities.  A cautious approach is necessary.  The headline creates a negative sentiment, increasing the likelihood of a price drop, but it's crucial to remember that market reactions are complex and influenced by many factors beyond a single news piece.  Therefore, I'll assign probabilities that reflect the uncertainty introduced by the lack of article content, leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the negative tone of the headline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```\n"
