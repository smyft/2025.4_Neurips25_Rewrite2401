Here's what the CEOs of Apple, Meta and Microsoft are saying\nNews Content: The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of the DeepSeek AI models on the tech industry, particularly highlighting the competitive pressure on Big Tech companies, including Apple. While Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed a positive view on innovation driving efficiency, the company is also facing challenges in China with a reported revenue decline. The overall sentiment from the news is mixed; while there is optimism about AI advancements, the competitive landscape and Apple's specific challenges may weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to the ongoing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup offering competitive AI models at a lower cost, could potentially pressure Apple to innovate more efficiently and potentially reduce its AI infrastructure spending in the long run. Tim Cook's comment about innovation driving efficiency being a good thing suggests Apple is aware of this trend and potentially open to adapting. However, the news also mentions Apple's revenue being down 11% year-over-year in China, which is a significant concern. While the DeepSeek news itself didn't directly cause a sell-off in Apple stock, the broader implications for the AI landscape and Apple's existing challenges in China create uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, I believe the probability of a stock price rise or fall is relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a potential fall due to the existing revenue concerns in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on DeepSeek's impact on Big Tech, with Apple CEO Tim Cook offering a generally positive but non-committal response.  While Cook mentions that innovation driving efficiency is good, his statement lacks specifics regarding Apple's plans or how DeepSeek directly affects Apple's business.  The news also highlights Apple's existing challenges in China, with an 11% year-over-year revenue decline. This negative factor counteracts any potential positive sentiment from Cook's comments.  The overall impact of DeepSeek on Apple is unclear, and the news doesn't provide a strong catalyst for either a significant price rise or fall. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to the existing challenges in China.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, as a competitive player in the AI space, which has caused a sell-off in global tech stocks. However, the CEOs of Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have responded optimistically, suggesting that innovation and efficiency driven by DeepSeek could benefit the industry. Apple's stock avoided the initial sell-off, and Tim Cook's comments indicate a positive outlook on innovation. However, Apple's revenue decline in China could be a concern. Overall, the positive tone from Big Tech CEOs and the potential for industry-wide benefits from DeepSeek's innovations suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on Big Tech companies including Apple. DeepSeek's open-source AI models, which are competitive yet cheaper, have raised questions about Big Tech's spending on AI infrastructure. The CEOs of Apple, Meta, and Microsoft have responded to DeepSeek's advancements with an optimistic tone, highlighting potential benefits and innovations. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, views innovation that drives efficiency as a good thing. Given that Apple stock avoided the initial sell-off and Cook's positive stance on innovation, the news seems neutral to slightly positive for Apple. However, the overall impact on stock price movement is uncertain and may depend on future developments in AI technology and competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its potential impact on Big Tech companies, including Apple. The CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have taken an optimistic tone, viewing DeepSeek's innovations as a positive development for the industry. While DeepSeek's cheaper-yet-competitive AI models may raise questions about Big Tech's spending on AI infrastructure, the overall tone of the article suggests that the industry is embracing the innovation and seeing it as an opportunity for growth. Apple's stock avoided the initial sell-off, and Tim Cook's comments suggest that the company views efficiency-driven innovation as a positive. However, Apple is facing revenue decline in China, which could be a concern. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on global tech stocks. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledges the positive aspects of AI innovation but mentions challenges in China. Given Apple's strong market position and the neutral stance taken by Cook, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
