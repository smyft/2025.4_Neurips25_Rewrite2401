A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, a TikTok ban may benefit Apple by reducing competition in the social media space, potentially increasing the usage of Apple's own services. However, the pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors raises concerns about the company's AI capabilities and could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a cautious outlook on Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). The TikTok ban, while potentially benefiting other social media platforms, doesn't directly impact Apple's core business. The pause of AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative development, suggesting issues with their AI initiatives and potentially impacting their reputation for quality. However, this is likely a temporary setback. The Intel news is irrelevant to Apple. Overall, the negative news is likely to have a slightly greater impact than the neutral news, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news piece contains multiple unrelated items. The TikTok ban is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly.  Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a minor negative, suggesting potential reputational risk and development setbacks for this specific feature.  However, this is likely a small issue compared to Apple's overall business.  The news about Intel is completely irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the net impact of the news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the AI news.  The probability of a price rise is low, while the probability of a price fall is also relatively low, with the most likely scenario being no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three key points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in its AI-generated news summaries, which could be perceived negatively by investors as it highlights operational issues. This might lead to a slight negative sentiment around the stock. However, the impact is likely limited as the news is not directly related to Apple's core business or financial performance. The TikTok ban does not directly affect Apple, and the Intel news is irrelevant to Apple's stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors may have a slightly negative impact on the stock price. However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of the company. The TikTok ban and Intel's potential acquisition are not directly related to Apple's stock price movement. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced, but with a slight bias towards a fall due to the negative news about the AI-generated news summaries.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) involves a temporary pause in their AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This event might cause minor concerns among investors regarding the reliability and accuracy of their AI initiatives. However, it does not seem to have a significant negative impact on the overall business or financial health of the company. The primary focus of the news is on TikTok and Intel, which do not directly affect Apple's stock performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The upheld TikTok ban may indirectly benefit Apple by reducing competition in the social media space, but it does not directly impact Apple's core business. The pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors raises concerns about Apple's AI capabilities, which could negatively affect investor sentiment. However, this issue is likely a minor setback in the context of Apple's overall business performance. Given the mixed signals, the probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall due to the negative implications of the AI news, but not significantly. Overall, the sentiment is cautious.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans slightly negative, primarily due to the pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries. While the TikTok ban and Intel news are largely irrelevant to Apple, the AI issue raises concerns about execution and quality control, even if it's a relatively minor setback. The previous predictions show a slight bias towards a price fall. Considering this, I will maintain a slightly negative outlook, but not as strongly as some previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. The TikTok ban is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business. The pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a minor negative, suggesting some reputational risk and potential development setbacks. However, this is likely a small issue in the context of Apple's overall performance.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price fall.  Considering the relatively minor nature of the negative news and the overall strength of Apple, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise than a price fall, but acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) primarily focuses on the pause of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This could be perceived negatively by investors as it highlights potential issues with the company's AI initiatives, possibly affecting sentiment. However, this is a relatively minor issue compared to Apple's broader business operations and financial health. The TikTok ban and Intel's potential acquisition are not directly relevant to Apple's stock performance. Given the mixed but generally neutral to slightly negative impact of the news, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is balanced, with a slight edge towards a fall due to the negative AI news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. The TikTok ban, while potentially beneficial by reducing competition in the social media space, does not directly impact Apple's core business. However, the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors could slightly negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple's AI capabilities. The Intel news is irrelevant to Apple's stock movement. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems slightly higher than that of a fall but with a cautious outlook due to the AI-related issues.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) involves a pause in their AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, which may cause minor concerns among investors. However, this event does not seem to have a significant negative impact on the overall business or financial health of the company. The primary focus of the news is on TikTok and Intel, which do not directly affect Apple's stock performance. Considering the mixed but relatively neutral impact of the news, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced. However, given the slight negative sentiment around the AI news, there might be a slight bias towards a fall. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there is a trend towards a cautious outlook with a slight bias towards a stock price fall, but the probabilities are generally close to 0.5, indicating uncertainty. Therefore, the estimated probabilities are based on a balanced assessment of the news impact, considering both the direct and indirect effects on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses two events affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL): the pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors and the TikTok ban. While the pause in AI-generated news summaries could raise concerns about Apple's AI capabilities, this is a relatively minor issue that does not significantly impact the company's core business or financial performance. The TikTok ban, although it might reduce competition in the social media space, does not directly benefit Apple. The news about Intel is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Given the mixed signals and the minor nature of the AI-related news, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. The upheld TikTok ban may reduce competition in the social media space, which could indirectly benefit Apple, but it does not directly affect its core business. The pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors raises concerns about Apple's AI capabilities, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, this issue is relatively minor compared to Apple's overall business performance. The Intel news is irrelevant to Apple. Considering these factors, the probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall due to the negative implications of the AI news, but the overall impact is not significant enough to warrant a strong bias in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from previous rounds leans towards a slightly negative outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to the pause in AI-generated news summaries. While the TikTok ban and Intel news are considered largely irrelevant, the AI issue raises concerns about execution and quality control, even if it's a minor setback. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight bias towards a price fall, but the probabilities are generally close to 0.5, indicating uncertainty. Given the relatively minor nature of the negative news and the overall strength of Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise, but acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news is mixed. The TikTok ban is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business. The pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a minor negative, potentially impacting investor sentiment slightly. However, this is likely a small issue compared to Apple's overall business performance.  The Intel news is completely unrelated. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a price fall, but the probabilities are generally close to 0.5, indicating significant uncertainty. Considering the relatively minor nature of the negative news and the overall strength of Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a price fall, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock movements and the lack of significant positive or negative news directly impacting Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc.

The TikTok ban is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. The pause in AI-generated news summaries may raise concerns about Apple's AI capabilities, but it is a relatively minor issue and does not significantly impact the company's core business. The Intel news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is cautiously negative, primarily driven by the AI-related news. Considering the minor nature of these events and Apple's strong core business, the impact on the stock price is expected to be minimal.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed impact on Apple's stock price.

The TikTok ban is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business. The pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a minor negative, potentially impacting investor sentiment slightly. However, this is likely a small issue compared to Apple's overall business performance. The Intel news is completely unrelated.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, clustering around a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but with probabilities generally close to 0.5, indicating significant uncertainty.  The consistent slight negative bias across multiple models stems from the AI news, which, while minor, introduces a degree of negative sentiment.  However, given Apple's overall strength and the relatively minor nature of the negative news, a significant price movement in either direction is unlikely.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the consensus of previous predictions and the presence of even a minor negative news item, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc.
