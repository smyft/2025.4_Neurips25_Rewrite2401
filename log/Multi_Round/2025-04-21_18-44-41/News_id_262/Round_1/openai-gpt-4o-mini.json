A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, a TikTok ban may benefit Apple by reducing competition in the social media space, potentially increasing the usage of Apple's own services. However, the pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors raises concerns about the company's AI capabilities and could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a cautious outlook on Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). The TikTok ban, while potentially benefiting other social media platforms, doesn't directly impact Apple's core business. The pause of AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative development, suggesting issues with their AI initiatives and potentially impacting their reputation for quality. However, this is likely a temporary setback. The Intel news is irrelevant to Apple. Overall, the negative news is likely to have a slightly greater impact than the neutral news, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news piece contains multiple unrelated items. The TikTok ban is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly.  Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a minor negative, suggesting potential reputational risk and development setbacks for this specific feature.  However, this is likely a small issue compared to Apple's overall business.  The news about Intel is completely irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the net impact of the news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the AI news.  The probability of a price rise is low, while the probability of a price fall is also relatively low, with the most likely scenario being no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three key points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in its AI-generated news summaries, which could be perceived negatively by investors as it highlights operational issues. This might lead to a slight negative sentiment around the stock. However, the impact is likely limited as the news is not directly related to Apple's core business or financial performance. The TikTok ban does not directly affect Apple, and the Intel news is irrelevant to Apple's stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors may have a slightly negative impact on the stock price. However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of the company. The TikTok ban and Intel's potential acquisition are not directly related to Apple's stock price movement. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced, but with a slight bias towards a fall due to the negative news about the AI-generated news summaries.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) involves a temporary pause in their AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This event might cause minor concerns among investors regarding the reliability and accuracy of their AI initiatives. However, it does not seem to have a significant negative impact on the overall business or financial health of the company. The primary focus of the news is on TikTok and Intel, which do not directly affect Apple's stock performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
