(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings season for Big Tech, including Apple, is likely to be influenced by both AI revenue discussions and the potential impact of President Trump's policies. Apple's strong relationship with Trump may mitigate concerns over tariffs, which could positively affect investor sentiment. However, the overall market reaction to earnings reports from peers like Microsoft and Meta, which have seen mixed results, could create volatility. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on the tech sector, there is a balanced outlook for Apple's stock. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the favorable relationship with the administration and the ongoing AI trend, but also acknowledge the risk of a fall due to market reactions to earnings and broader economic factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag of potential impacts on Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could help Apple avoid tariffs, which would be positive. The potential for relaxed antitrust regulations could also benefit Apple, allowing for more M&A activity. However, uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and its potential impact on the semiconductor industry, which is crucial for Apple's products, introduces a negative element. The article also highlights the importance of AI revenue and spending, which will be a key focus for investors. While Apple is expected to discuss its AI strategy, the market's reaction will depend on whether the company can demonstrate a clear path to monetization and meet investor expectations. The potential impact of Trump's stance on TikTok is less directly relevant to Apple compared to Meta and Google, but could still have some indirect effects on the competitive landscape. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and the need for Apple to demonstrate strong AI progress make it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high confidence. Given the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall due to the uncertainty and the high expectations surrounding AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While President Trump's potential policies could positively impact Apple through reduced tariffs and relaxed antitrust regulations (given Cook's relationship with Trump), there are also uncertainties.  Trump's stance on the CHIPS Act could negatively affect the semiconductor supply chain, potentially impacting Apple's production costs.  The news focuses heavily on the broader tech sector's response to Trump's policies and AI investments, making it difficult to isolate Apple's specific reaction.  The overall tone is cautious, highlighting both potential upsides and downsides.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned reflecting this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the existing positive relationship between Apple's CEO and the President.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings season for Big Tech companies, including Apple, with a focus on how the new Trump administration might impact the sector. Key points include potential tariffs, antitrust regulations, and the CHIPS Act, which could affect Apple's operations and costs. However, Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which previously helped avoid tariffs. The market's reaction could be mixed, with potential concerns over regulatory changes balanced by Apple's strong position and past resilience under similar conditions. The anticipation of earnings and AI developments could also influence investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of Trump's presidency on Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article highlights the uncertainty around tariffs, export controls, and antitrust regulations, which could affect Apple's stock price. However, it also mentions that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which might mitigate any negative impact. Additionally, the article mentions that investors will be closely watching how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don't end up on the wrong end of Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from China. Apple's ability to avoid tariffs during the first Trump administration and its potential to benefit from a more relaxed antitrust environment could be seen as positive factors. Nevertheless, the overall impact of Trump's policies on Apple's stock price is uncertain and may depend on various factors, including the company's ability to navigate potential tariffs and regulations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings season for Big Tech companies, including Apple, and how the newly-inaugurated President Trump's policies may impact their bottom lines. The article mentions that Trump's administration may impose tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, which could affect companies like Apple. However, it also notes that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with Trump, which could help the company avoid tariffs. Additionally, the article mentions the potential impact of the CHIPS Act and AI revenue and spending on tech companies. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling depends on how investors perceive the potential risks and benefits of Trump's policies and the company's ability to navigate them.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple factors affecting Apple Inc., including the potential impact of Trump's policies, AI-related earnings expectations, and competition dynamics. While there is concern over regulatory changes and tariffs, Apple's strong relationship with the administration could mitigate negative impacts. Additionally, AI-related positive trends could drive investor interest, although increased competition and capex spending remain risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
