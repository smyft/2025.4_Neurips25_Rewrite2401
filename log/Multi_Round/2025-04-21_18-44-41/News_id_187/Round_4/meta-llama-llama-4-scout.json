(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos\nNews Content: DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Salesforce's competitive positioning against Microsoft in the AI space, which indirectly affects Apple as a major player in technology. While Salesforce's stock has risen significantly due to positive sentiment around its AI solutions, the skepticism from analysts like John DiFucci could create uncertainty in the tech sector. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's core business or financials. Given the overall positive sentiment towards AI and the tech sector, I estimate a higher probability of stock price stability or a slight rise for Apple, rather than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding AI, specifically their respective AI agent offerings. While Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned, the broader context of AI competition within the tech industry could indirectly influence investor sentiment. However, the direct impact on Apple is minimal. The news highlights Salesforce's AI progress and some skepticism surrounding it. Microsoft's AI strategy is also questioned. Given the lack of direct connection to Apple and the mixed sentiment surrounding the AI competition between Salesforce and Microsoft, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a public spat between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) CEOs regarding their respective AI offerings.  While the article mentions Salesforce's positive reception of its Agentforce AI product and strong sales, the news itself is not directly about Apple (AAPL).  The rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft is relevant to those companies' stock prices, but it has no direct bearing on Apple's performance. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this news is essentially neutral. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors unrelated to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with Benioff criticizing Microsoft's Copilot and highlighting Salesforce's Agentforce successes. While the article mentions Salesforce's stock performance (up 25% since Dreamforce) and strong Agentforce adoption, it also notes skepticism from Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded Salesforce to Sell. The news is more focused on Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) rather than Apple (AAPL). Since Apple is not directly mentioned or implicated in the news, the impact on its stock price is likely neutral. The probabilities reflect this lack of direct relevance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the competition between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI space, with Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff criticizing Microsoft's Copilot and ChatGPT. However, the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its stock performance. As a result, the news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, the overall market sentiment and tech industry trends can indirectly influence Apple's stock. Given that the news is more relevant to CRM and MSFT, it's reasonable to assume that the impact on AAPL will be minimal. The probability of AAPL's stock price movement due to this news is low, and any movement might be attributed to the broader market trends rather than this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticizes Microsoft's Copilot, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responds with comments about the potential collapse of business applications. Despite the criticism, Salesforce has seen strong adoption of its Agentforce AI bots, with 200 deals closed in the third quarter and a total of 2,000 AI-related deals. The Street has largely been bullish on Salesforce's AI efforts, with the stock price rising over 25% since the introduction of new Agentforce solutions. However, there are some skeptics, including Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded his rating to Sell. Given the mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.6, and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft, specifically criticizing Microsoft's AI tools. This rivalry could potentially attract more customers to Salesforce as it positions itself favorably against its competitor. Additionally, Salesforce reported strong uptake of their AI solutions, leading to increased stock performance. However, there is skepticism from some analysts regarding Salesforce's ability to monetize these AI offerings effectively. This mixed feedback suggests that while there is positive sentiment driven by competitive positioning, there are also concerns about long-term profitability.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the competitive dynamics between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI space, which indirectly affects the broader tech sector, including Apple. While Salesforce's strong performance and the ongoing rivalry may create a positive sentiment in the tech industry, the direct impact on Apple's stock is minimal as the news does not mention Apple specifically. The mixed analyst sentiments regarding Salesforce's ability to monetize its AI solutions introduce some uncertainty. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stability or a slight rise in Apple's stock price, but with a significant chance of a fall due to broader market reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the AI competition between Salesforce and Microsoft. While Apple isn't directly mentioned, the overall tech industry sentiment and AI trends can indirectly influence Apple's stock. Previous models' predictions are varied, with some leaning towards neutral impact and others suggesting a slight rise or fall. The general consensus is that the direct impact on Apple is minimal. Considering the mixed sentiment surrounding the Salesforce-Microsoft rivalry and the lack of direct connection to Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral impact, but with a slight lean towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the AI rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft.  While this is relevant to the tech sector, it has minimal direct impact on Apple.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the indirect nature of the news's influence.  The positive sentiment around Salesforce's AI advancements might create a slightly positive ripple effect in the broader tech market, but it's unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the varied opinions from other models, I predict a near-neutral probability for both price increases and decreases, slightly favoring stability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on the rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding their AI offerings, with Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff criticizing Microsoft's Copilot and highlighting Salesforce's Agentforce successes. While the article mentions Salesforce's stock performance and strong Agentforce adoption, it also notes skepticism from analysts like John DiFucci. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its business. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as the news is more relevant to CRM and MSFT. The probabilities reflect this lack of direct relevance, with a neutral stance on Apple's stock movement due to this specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding their respective AI offerings. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned or implicated in the news. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral as the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or financials. However, considering the overall positive sentiment towards AI and the tech sector, there is a slight inclination towards a positive outlook. The mixed sentiment from various analysts and the competitive landscape in the AI space suggest that the probabilities should reflect a balanced view with a slight bias towards stability or a moderate rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI business tools market, with no direct mention of Apple Inc.

Although Salesforce has reported strong uptake of their AI solutions, leading to increased stock performance, there is skepticism from some analysts regarding the long-term profitability of these AI offerings. This mixed feedback suggests that while there is positive sentiment driven by competitive positioning, there are also concerns about long-term profitability. Since Apple is not directly mentioned or implicated in the news, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The overall market sentiment and tech industry trends can indirectly influence Apple's stock, but given the limited direct relevance, the probabilities of a rise or fall are expected to be relatively neutral.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the competitive dynamics between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI space, which indirectly affects the broader tech sector, including Apple.

Apple is not directly mentioned, and previous rounds of predictions indicate a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock. Considering the lack of direct relevance and the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stability or a slight rise in Apple's stock price. However, the mixed analyst sentiments regarding Salesforce's ability to monetize its AI solutions introduce some uncertainty, preventing a strong positive prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on the AI rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft.  Apple is not directly mentioned. While the broader tech sector sentiment might be influenced, the direct impact on Apple is expected to be minimal.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting this lack of direct connection.  The overall sentiment is leaning slightly towards a neutral or slightly positive impact due to the general positive sentiment around AI and the tech sector. However, the lack of direct relevance to Apple significantly limits any potential price movement stemming from this news.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards neutrality, with a slight bias towards a stable or slightly increased price, reflecting the overall market trends rather than the specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI space, with Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff criticizing Microsoft's AI tools.
