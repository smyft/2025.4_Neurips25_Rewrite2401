(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos\nNews Content: DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.
