(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, being perceived as safe assets amid market uncertainty. However, it also highlights concerns about low expected returns due to excessive spending among these companies. This duality suggests that while there may be some investor confidence in Apple as a safe asset, the overall sentiment regarding low returns could lead to a cautious approach from investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the 'Magnificent Seven' are seen as safe assets, which could be a positive for Apple's stock, the article also suggests that this perception leads to lower expected returns and companies spending money on each other, potentially resulting in 'pretty low returns'. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about low returns and the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, but the 'safe asset' perception provides some support. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, and their status as safe assets in uncertain times.  Professor Desai's 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor highlights the internal competition and overspending within Big Tech, leading to potentially low returns. While Apple is considered a safe asset, this implies lower expected returns, suggesting a decreased likelihood of significant price increases. The overall market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI advancements further contributes to a bearish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, although the impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's established position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc., and compares their market dominance to a 'snake eating its own tail,' suggesting that their growth may be unsustainable due to excessive spending and low expected returns. This metaphor implies that the market may be overvaluing these companies as 'safe assets,' potentially leading to investor skepticism. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio could mitigate some negative sentiment. The mention of a tech sell-off fueled by news from a Chinese AI startup adds uncertainty, but Apple's specific impact is unclear.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high spending on each other and themselves, likened to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This metaphor suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant or declining growth cycle. The comparison of these companies to a safe asset with expected low returns may lead investors to be cautious or reduce their expectations for future growth, potentially resulting in a stock price decrease.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, according to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, this perception leads to low expected returns due to the companies spending money on each other, creating a self-sustaining cycle. This phenomenon is likened to a snake eating its own tail, implying that the growth of these companies may be limited. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the article suggests that the 'Magnificent Seven' companies, including Apple, may experience low returns.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, including Apple, being viewed as safe assets amidst global uncertainty. While this might initially attract investment due to perceived safety, Professor Mihir Desai suggests that this could lead to low returns as these companies spend excessively on themselves and each other, akin to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This scenario implies that investors may not see substantial gains, which could dampen investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
