Here's the Best of the Bunch for Income Investors to Buy Right Now.\nNews Content: Warren Buffett primarily buys large-cap stocks for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. That makes sense because Berkshire has so much money to deploy that smaller companies simply don't move the needle enough for the giant conglomerate.\n\nBecause of this focus on large-cap stocks, you probably won't be surprised that Buffett owns six stocks that are members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI). Which is the best pick of the bunch for income investors right now?\n\nBuffett's Dow six-pack\n\nThe two stocks Buffett has owned the longest are both members of the Dow. Buffett initiated a position for Berkshire in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) in 1988. He bought shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) in 1991. Both Coke and AmEx are \"forever stocks\" for Buffett. In his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, he wrote that the two stocks were among a select group he planned to \"maintain indefinitely.\"\n\nHowever, Buffett thinks another Dow stock is \"an even better business\" than Coca-Cola and American Express. He didn't list Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in the latest shareholder letter as one of the stocks he would own indefinitely. But when asked about the omission by CNBC's Becky Quick at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2024, Buffett sang Apple's praises.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Apple ranks as Berkshire's largest holding, while AmEx is No. 2 and Coke is No. 4. A Dow stock also holds the No. 5 spot -- Chevron(NYSE: CVX). Buffett began aggressively buying the oil stock in the fourth quarter of 2020 after its steep plunge during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBerkshire doesn't have such large stakes in the other two Dow stocks it owns. Both Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa(NYSE: V) make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nHow these Dow stocks compare\n\nAmerican Express has been the biggest winner by far over the last 12 months among Buffett's six Dow stocks, with its shares skyrocketing over 70%. Amazon stock has also soared more than 45%. All the others except Coca-Cola have delivered double-digit percentage gains.\n\nDespite its strong performance, American Express' valuation remains more reasonable than most of the others. The financial services giant's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 20.5, lower than Coke's forward P/E of 21.1 and well below the forward earnings multiples of Visa, Apple, and Amazon. Only Chevron has a lower valuation, with its shares trading at 12.6 times forward earnings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat about earnings growth? Amazon is the clear leader. The e-commerce and cloud services leader reported earnings of $15.3 billion in its latest quarterly update, a year-over-year increase of 55%. None of Buffett's other Dow stocks came close to that level of earnings growth in their most recent quarters.\n\nBuffett probably doesn't care what Wall Street thinks about these stocks. In case you were wondering, though, Coca-Cola appears to be analysts' favorite right now. The consensus 12-month price target for Coke reflects an upside potential of 15%. Wall Street is also relatively bullish about Amazon, Apple, and Chevron.\n\nBest of the bunch for income investors\n\nNow, to answer our initial question: Which of Buffett's Dow stocks is the best pick for income investors? There are two main contenders -- Chevron and Coca-Cola.\n\nWe can scratch Amazon off the list, since it doesn't offer a dividend. Apple, American Express, and Visa probably won't appeal to income investors much either with their paltry forward dividend yields of under 1%.\n\nChevron, though, pays a forward dividend yield of 4.05%. The company has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Coca-Cola's yield of 3.1% is lower. However, its track record is even more impressive. The food and beverage maker is a Dividend King, with 62 consecutive dividend increases and counting.\n\nI don't think income investors can go wrong with either Chevron or Coke. However, I think Chevron's higher yield makes it the best of the bunch.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's the Best of the Bunch for Income Investors to Buy Right Now. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's positive view on Apple, indicating that it is a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. While Buffett did not label Apple as a 'forever stock' in his latest letter, his praise suggests confidence in its long-term potential. Additionally, the overall bullish sentiment from analysts regarding Apple, combined with its strong market position and historical performance, supports a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the mention of other stocks like Chevron and Coca-Cola as better options for income investors may create some downward pressure on Apple's stock in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, but with some risk of a fall due to competitive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Warren Buffett's holdings in Dow Jones stocks and identifies Chevron as the best pick for income investors due to its higher dividend yield. While Apple is mentioned as Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding and praised by Buffett, the article doesn't explicitly recommend it for income investors. The article also mentions a \"Double Down\" opportunity, referencing Apple's past performance, which could generate some positive sentiment. However, the primary focus on income investing and the recommendation of Chevron might divert some attention away from Apple. Overall, the news is mildly positive for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a general advertisement and not specific to Apple at this time. Therefore, the probability of a significant price rise is moderate, and the probability of a fall is relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's holdings in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, highlighting Apple as one of his largest positions. While the article doesn't directly predict Apple's stock price movement, it emphasizes Buffett's positive view of the company, even though he didn't list it as a 'forever stock' in his latest letter.  The article's main focus is on income-generating stocks, and while Apple's dividend yield is low, the mention of it as a top holding by Buffett could indirectly influence investor sentiment positively.  However, the article's primary recommendation is for Chevron and Coca-Cola for income investors, suggesting that the news is not specifically bullish for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, as the news is largely neutral regarding Apple's prospects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's positive remarks about Apple (AAPL) during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, despite not listing it as a 'forever stock' in the latest shareholder letter. Apple is Berkshire's largest holding, indicating strong confidence. The article also mentions that Wall Street is relatively bullish on Apple, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the focus on income investors might not directly impact Apple's stock price significantly, as its dividend yield is under 1%. Overall, the positive sentiment and Buffett's endorsement are likely to outweigh any neutral or negative aspects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Although Apple is mentioned as a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, the article concludes that Chevron is the best choice for income investors due to its higher dividend yield. The article does not provide any negative news about Apple, but rather presents it as a strong company with a large stake in Berkshire's portfolio. Given this context, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, as it reinforces the company's position as a valuable holding in Berkshire's portfolio.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's views on various Dow Jones stocks, including Apple. Although Buffett has a large stake in Apple, he did not mention it as one of the stocks he plans to hold indefinitely. However, he praised Apple's performance, and it is still the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Additionally, the article does not provide specific news about any recent developments or changes in Apple's outlook that would directly impact its stock price. The broader market sentiment towards Apple may be influenced more by general trends in the technology sector and broader economic conditions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
