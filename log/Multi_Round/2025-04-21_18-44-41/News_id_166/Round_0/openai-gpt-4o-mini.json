This suggests stability and predictability in Apple's financial performance, which is generally viewed positively by investors. However, since the news does not indicate any significant positive or negative surprises, the stock price may not experience a strong upward movement. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising slightly, but also acknowledge a reasonable chance of it falling if market sentiment shifts negatively or if broader market conditions are unfavorable.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Poised for Largely In-Line First-Quarter Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}"
