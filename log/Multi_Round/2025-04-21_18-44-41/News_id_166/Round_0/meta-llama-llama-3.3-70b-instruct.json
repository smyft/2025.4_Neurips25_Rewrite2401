This implies that there are no significant positive or negative surprises expected, which could lead to a stable stock price. However, the lack of a positive surprise might slightly disappoint some investors, potentially leading to a slight decrease in stock price. On the other hand, the confirmation of in-line revenue could also be seen as a relief, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Given the neutral tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising slightly, rather than falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple Poised for Largely In-Line First-Quarter Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
