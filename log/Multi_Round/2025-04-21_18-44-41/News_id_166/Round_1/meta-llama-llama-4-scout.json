A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests stability and predictability in Apple's financial performance, which is generally viewed positively by investors. However, since the news does not indicate any significant positive or negative surprises, the stock price may not experience a strong upward movement. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising slightly, but also acknowledge a reasonable chance of it falling if market sentiment shifts negatively or if broader market conditions are unfavorable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's revenue is expected to be 'largely in line' with market estimates. This implies no significant surprises, either positive or negative. While a positive surprise would likely drive the stock price up, and a negative surprise would drive it down, 'in line' results typically lead to a relatively neutral reaction. However, the market has already priced in these expectations. Since the article is behind a paywall, we lack the full context of Morgan Stanley's analysis. Without knowing the specifics of their report (e.g., future guidance, commentary on specific product lines), it's difficult to make a strong prediction. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall because 'in line' results can sometimes disappoint investors who were hoping for a beat, and the lack of further information from the article makes it difficult to assess any potential positive catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations.  This is generally considered neutral news.  A 'largely in-line' prediction suggests there's no significant positive or negative surprise. While this might not cause a large price movement, the market's reaction will depend on other factors such as investor sentiment, overall market conditions, and any other concurrent news.  Given the lack of substantial positive or negative information, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively unchanged price, with slightly higher probability for a minor price fluctuation in either direction due to general market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, as per Morgan Stanley. Since the revenue is in line with expectations, it suggests no major surprises, which typically leads to a neutral market reaction. Investors may not see a reason to buy or sell aggressively, resulting in stable stock price movement. However, slight positive sentiment from meeting expectations could lead to a marginal increase in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no major surprises or significant deviations from expectations. Typically, such news would be considered neutral or slightly positive, as it indicates stability and confirms market expectations. However, without a strong positive catalyst, the stock price might not experience a significant surge. The probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is relatively low, assuming no other negative factors emerge.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This implies that there are no significant positive or negative surprises expected, which could lead to a stable stock price. However, the lack of a positive surprise might slightly disappoint some investors, potentially leading to a slight decrease in stock price. On the other hand, the confirmation of in-line revenue could also be seen as a relief, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Given the neutral tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising slightly, rather than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. Since the news does not present any unexpected developments or strong catalysts for significant change, the probabilities for either rise or fall are relatively balanced but slightly favor a minor increase due to confirmation of expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
