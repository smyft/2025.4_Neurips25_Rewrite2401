A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests stability and predictability in Apple's financial performance, which is generally viewed positively by investors. However, since the news does not indicate any significant positive or negative surprises, the stock price may not experience a strong upward movement. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising slightly, but also acknowledge a reasonable chance of it falling if market sentiment shifts negatively or if broader market conditions are unfavorable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's revenue is expected to be 'largely in line' with market estimates. This implies no significant surprises, either positive or negative. While a positive surprise would likely drive the stock price up, and a negative surprise would drive it down, 'in line' results typically lead to a relatively neutral reaction. However, the market has already priced in these expectations. Since the article is behind a paywall, we lack the full context of Morgan Stanley's analysis. Without knowing the specifics of their report (e.g., future guidance, commentary on specific product lines), it's difficult to make a strong prediction. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall because 'in line' results can sometimes disappoint investors who were hoping for a beat, and the lack of further information from the article makes it difficult to assess any potential positive catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations.  This is generally considered neutral news.  A 'largely in-line' prediction suggests there's no significant positive or negative surprise. While this might not cause a large price movement, the market's reaction will depend on other factors such as investor sentiment, overall market conditions, and any other concurrent news.  Given the lack of substantial positive or negative information, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively unchanged price, with slightly higher probability for a minor price fluctuation in either direction due to general market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, as per Morgan Stanley. Since the revenue is in line with expectations, it suggests no major surprises, which typically leads to a neutral market reaction. Investors may not see a reason to buy or sell aggressively, resulting in stable stock price movement. However, slight positive sentiment from meeting expectations could lead to a marginal increase in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no major surprises or significant deviations from expectations. Typically, such news would be considered neutral or slightly positive, as it indicates stability and confirms market expectations. However, without a strong positive catalyst, the stock price might not experience a significant surge. The probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is relatively low, assuming no other negative factors emerge.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This implies that there are no significant positive or negative surprises expected, which could lead to a stable stock price. However, the lack of a positive surprise might slightly disappoint some investors, potentially leading to a slight decrease in stock price. On the other hand, the confirmation of in-line revenue could also be seen as a relief, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Given the neutral tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising slightly, rather than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. Since the news does not present any unexpected developments or strong catalysts for significant change, the probabilities for either rise or fall are relatively balanced but slightly favor a minor increase due to confirmation of expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, suggesting stability and predictability in its financial performance. This typically leads to a neutral market reaction, as there are no significant surprises to drive the stock price sharply in either direction. However, the consensus among previous predictions leans slightly towards a positive sentiment, as meeting expectations can be viewed favorably by investors. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging a reasonable chance of it falling if broader market conditions are unfavorable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The consensus from the previous rounds is that 'in-line' revenue is generally neutral news. However, some models lean slightly towards a positive reaction, while others lean towards a negative one, citing potential disappointment from investors hoping for a beat. Considering the previous predictions, I will slightly adjust my prediction to reflect a more balanced view, acknowledging the potential for a slight negative reaction if investors were expecting more. The fact that the article is behind a paywall limits the information available, making a strong prediction difficult. I will also consider the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral.  Morgan Stanley's prediction of in-line revenue with market expectations suggests no significant positive or negative surprises.  This is generally viewed as a non-event by the market, meaning the stock price is unlikely to experience a dramatic move in either direction.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly centered around 0.5 for both rise and fall.  The lack of detail in the news article (due to the paywall) prevents a more precise prediction.  Considering the overall consensus and the inherent uncertainty, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, reflecting the potential for a positive reaction to meeting expectations, even if it's not a significant beat. However, the possibility of a price fall remains significant due to the potential for disappointment among investors hoping for better-than-expected results and the general market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, as per Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook with no significant positive or negative surprises. Historically, such news tends to result in stable stock price movements, as it confirms market expectations without providing new catalysts for significant change. However, slight positive sentiment from meeting expectations could lead to a marginal increase in stock price, while the lack of a positive surprise might slightly disappoint some investors, potentially leading to a minor decrease. Given the neutral tone of the news and the balanced probabilities from previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the confirmation of expectations, but the difference is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests that there are no major surprises expected, which typically results in a neutral or slightly positive market reaction. Investors may view this as a confirmation of stability and expectations, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price due to the absence of negative surprises. However, the lack of a significant positive surprise might limit the stock's upside potential. Given this neutral outlook, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge a reasonable chance of it falling if market sentiment shifts or if there are other concurrent factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. Considering the neutral tone of the news and the lack of strong catalysts for significant change, the probabilities for either rise or fall are relatively balanced. However, a slight positive sentiment from meeting expectations could lead to a marginal increase in stock price. Analyzing the predictions from other models, there is a trend towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a probability of around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Taking this into consideration, I estimate a similar probability for the stock price to rise, given the confirmation of in-line revenue and the potential for slight positive sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprises, which typically leads to a neutral market reaction. However, given the consistency with market expectations, there is a slight positive sentiment as meeting or exceeding expectations can reassure investors. Additionally, the consensus among previous predictions leans towards a slight upward movement in the stock price. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising slightly, while acknowledging a reasonable chance of stability or a minor decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, suggesting stability and predictability in its financial performance. This typically leads to a neutral market reaction, as there are no significant surprises to drive the stock price sharply in either direction. However, the consensus among previous predictions leans slightly towards a positive sentiment, as meeting expectations can be viewed favorably by investors. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging a reasonable chance of it falling if broader market conditions are unfavorable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's revenue is expected to be 'largely in line' with market estimates. This implies no significant surprises, either positive or negative. Most of the previous models predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting a potentially positive reaction to meeting expectations. However, some models also acknowledge the possibility of a slight negative reaction if investors were hoping for a beat. Given the neutral tone of the news and the trend of previous predictions, I will estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge a reasonable chance of it falling if broader market conditions are unfavorable or if investors were expecting more. I will also consider the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations. This is generally considered neutral news, as it confirms existing market sentiment and lacks a significant positive or negative catalyst.  The paywalled nature of the full article limits the available information, preventing a definitive prediction.  However, analyzing the previous predictions reveals a slight consensus towards a higher probability of a price rise.  Most models in previous rounds predicted a slightly higher probability of a price rise (around 0.55) than a fall (around 0.45), primarily because meeting expectations can be viewed positively by investors, indicating stability and confirming market forecasts.  The slight upward trend in predictions across rounds further supports this view.  While a negative reaction is possible if investors were hoping for a significant beat, the overall lack of strong negative news suggests a relatively low probability of a significant price drop. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the consensus and the generally positive interpretation of meeting expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, as per Morgan Stanley.

The consensus among previous predictions also leans towards a slight upward movement in the stock price, with most models estimating a probability of around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, I estimate a similar probability for the stock price to rise, given the confirmation of in-line revenue and the potential for slight positive sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprises, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. The majority of previous predictions lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the confirmation of expectations and slight positive sentiment. However, the lack of a significant positive surprise and the potential for market volatility means there is still a considerable chance of the stock price remaining stable or declining.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
