This suggests a favorable environment for tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that AAPL is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to benefit from this upward momentum. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a general positive trend in the tech sector, as evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) increasing. This suggests a favorable environment for tech companies like Apple. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or any company-specific news makes it difficult to assess the impact precisely. The news is also behind a paywall, limiting access to potentially more insightful information. Therefore, while a rise is more likely, a significant jump is not guaranteed. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise than a fall, but acknowledging the limited information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.  However, the article content is inaccessible, preventing a detailed analysis of specific factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, the probability estimates are based solely on the general positive sector trend.  A rise in the tech sector generally suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising, but the lack of specific information about Apple limits the confidence in this prediction.  The probabilities are assigned conservatively, reflecting the uncertainty due to the limited information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

This suggests a positive momentum in the tech sector, which is likely to have a favorable impact on AAPL's stock price. Given that AAPL is a major component of the tech sector and the XLK ETF, the positive sector performance is a strong indicator of upward movement for AAPL's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. This suggests a positive trend for technology stocks. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech company, it is likely that its stock price will be positively affected by this trend. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), are gaining on Friday afternoon. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major technology company, this positive trend in the tech sector could have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. Although the full article is not available, the general sentiment of the headline suggests a positive outlook for tech stocks, which increases the likelihood of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
