(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows a positive surprise in both EPS and revenue, indicating strong performance. However, the stock has underperformed the market this year and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting unfavorable estimate revisions. The overall industry outlook is also weak, being in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. These factors contribute to a cautious outlook despite the positive earnings report, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. The initial positive reaction might be tempered by the unfavorable estimate revisions trend leading up to the earnings release, reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This indicates analysts were already anticipating potential underperformance. Furthermore, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The industry rank (bottom 28%) also presents a headwind. Management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and industry challenges suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, even with the earnings beat. The earnings beat was also relatively small (1.69% surprise).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple beat earnings and revenue expectations, which is generally positive. However, the Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) and the unfavorable estimate revisions trend significantly outweigh the positive earnings surprise.  The industry outlook is also weak, with the Computer - Micro Computers industry ranking in the bottom 28%. While the earnings beat is a short-term positive, the negative outlook and sell rating suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the near term.  The management commentary on the earnings call will be crucial, but the current information points towards a bearish outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, which is generally positive. However, the earnings surprise of 1.69% is relatively modest compared to the previous quarter's 10.07% surprise. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates unfavorable earnings estimate revisions, suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. The stock has already underperformed the market year-to-date, losing 4.4% versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%. The industry rank (bottom 28%) also adds to the cautious outlook. While the beat on estimates could provide a short-term boost, the overall sentiment and unfavorable revisions may weigh on the stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. The company's revenue also surpassed estimates, posting $124.3 billion for the quarter. Despite the positive earnings report, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to unfavorable estimate revisions trend prior to the earnings release. Historically, the company has consistently beaten consensus EPS estimates but the current industry rank is in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries, which could impact stock performance. Given the mixed signals, there's a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to the Sell rating and industry performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive sign for the company's stock. However, the article also mentions that Apple has underperformed the market so far this year and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating that the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, the industry outlook is not favorable, with the Computer - Micro Computers industry ranking in the bottom 28% of the 250+ Zacks industries. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter, demonstrating stronger-than-expected performance. However, the recent estimate revisions trend is unfavorable, leading to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, suggesting that the shares might underperform the market in the near future. Despite the positive earnings surprise, the market reaction will likely be influenced by management's commentary and future expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, which is typically a positive indicator for stock performance. However, the earnings surprise was modest at 1.69%, and the company has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating unfavorable estimate revisions. Additionally, Apple has underperformed the market year-to-date, and the industry outlook is weak, ranking in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. These factors suggest that despite the positive earnings report, the overall sentiment remains cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: While Apple beat earnings and revenue estimates, several factors point to a likely price decrease. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates negative sentiment and unfavorable earnings estimate revisions. The industry outlook is also weak, and Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. Although the earnings beat is positive, the negative factors outweigh it, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, and there is no indication that others have positive information about the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple beat earnings and revenue expectations, which is positive. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating and unfavorable estimate revisions significantly outweigh this positive news. The relatively small earnings surprise (1.69%) further dampens the positive impact.  The weak industry outlook (bottom 28% of Zacks industries) adds to the negative sentiment. While the earnings beat might provide a short-term boost, the negative outlook and sell rating, combined with the previous underperformance compared to the S&P 500, suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the near term.  The consensus seems to lean towards a price drop, as reflected in the previous predictions. Management's commentary will be crucial, but the current information points towards a bearish outlook, although less extreme than some previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported a positive earnings surprise and revenue beat for Q1, which typically supports a stock price rise. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and unfavorable estimate revisions prior to the earnings release suggest underlying concerns. The stock has underperformed the market year-to-date, and the industry outlook is weak (bottom 28% of Zacks industries). While the earnings beat is a short-term positive, the negative sentiment from analysts and industry challenges likely outweigh this, leading to a higher probability of a price fall. Management's commentary on the earnings call could sway the outcome, but current indicators lean bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple Inc.
