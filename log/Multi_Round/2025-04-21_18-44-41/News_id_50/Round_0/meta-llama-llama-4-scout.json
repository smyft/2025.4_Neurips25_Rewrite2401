This news may negatively impact Apple's stock price as it suggests potential supply chain issues or decreased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple might be limited as the news is more closely related to STMicroelectronics' performance and the demand for legacy chips, which may not be a significant component of Apple's current product lineup. Given this, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, as the market may view this news as not materially impactful on Apple's overall business.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
