While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the news focuses on 'legacy semiconductors,' suggesting this might not directly impact Apple's core, high-margin products like iPhones, which use more advanced chips. However, the mention of Apple as a customer and the general negative sentiment surrounding chip demand could create some investor uncertainty. The impact is likely to be moderate, as Apple's product portfolio is diverse, and it's not solely reliant on legacy chips. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
