However, Apple has been known to invest in and utilize advanced glass technologies in their products, such as Gorilla Glass for their iPhones. If the news implies Apple is investing in glass stocks, it could potentially be a strategic move to secure materials for future products or to expand into new markets. This could be seen as a positive move, but without more context, the impact is uncertain. Given the lack of direct relevance and detail, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are difficult to estimate with precision.
