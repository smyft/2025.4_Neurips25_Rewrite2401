However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

The upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report is anticipated to show growth in EPS and revenue, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the expected upside of only 4% from the current price target may deter growth-focused investors. Additionally, the modest dividend yield may not attract income-focused investors. Overall, the strong historical performance and positive earnings expectations suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, despite some concerns about limited short-term growth potential.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance, highlighting the significant returns an investor would have realized over the past 10 years. While this information is positive and showcases Apple's long-term growth potential, it's backward-looking. The article also mentions upcoming earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which is a positive indicator. However, it also points out that the expected upside based on analyst price targets is only around 4%, which might not attract growth-focused investors. The modest dividend yield is also mentioned as a potential deterrent for income-focused investors. Overall, the article presents a mixed picture. The historical performance is strong, but the near-term outlook is less compelling. Given the upcoming earnings report, the market's reaction to the actual results will likely be a more significant driver of price movement than this retrospective article. Considering the positive earnings expectations, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but the limited upside potential and the mixed signals in the article keep the probability from being too high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's impressive past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting a substantial return on investment. While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the modest analyst price target and the lack of significant new information driving a strong bullish or bearish sentiment, the probabilities are assigned accordingly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors may not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors may be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper significant gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, highlighting that an investment of $10,000 ten years ago would now be worth $92,281, representing an 822.81% total return. The article also mentions that Apple has a consensus rating of 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside. However, it notes that growth-focused investors may not find Apple attractive due to the limited upside potential, and income-focused investors may be deterred by the modest dividend yield of 0.43%. The article does not contain any negative news that would suggest an imminent stock price fall. Given the overall positive historical performance and the 'Buy' consensus rating, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but the limited upside potential tempers this outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock over the past 10 years, highlighting a significant return of 822.81% for investors. It also mentions the company's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report and the expected EPS and revenue. Additionally, the article notes a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside potential. However, the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may not attract income-focused investors. Considering the overall positive tone of the article, the expected earnings growth, and the 'Buy' rating, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations. The company's historical success and strong financials suggest stability but with a modest outlook for the next 10 years. The current dividend yield is low, and while earnings and revenue are expected to grow, the expected upside potential is only around 4%, which might not excite growth-focused investors. The recent earnings beat suggests operational strength but might already be priced in.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's impressive historical performance, showcasing a significant return on investment over the past decade.

However, it also highlights a limited near-term upside of only 4% based on analyst price targets and a modest dividend yield. While the upcoming earnings are expected to be positive, the market's reaction to the actual results will likely be a more significant driver of price movement. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight bullish sentiment, but the limited upside and mixed signals in the article suggest a more cautious approach. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards from the average of previous predictions, acknowledging the historical success but also the potential for limited short-term growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article focuses heavily on Apple's past performance, which is positive but doesn't directly predict future price movements. While upcoming earnings are expected to be positive, the projected 4% upside is modest and may not excite growth investors.  The low dividend yield is another factor limiting appeal to income investors.  The consensus 'Buy' rating and positive past performance suggest a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the limited near-term growth potential and the overall lack of significantly new information temper this.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.5 to 0.65 for a price rise, I'm assigning a probability slightly weighted towards a rise, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective look at Apple's impressive historical performance, showing a significant return on investment over the past decade.

However, the article notes a modest 4% upside potential based on analyst price targets and a low dividend yield, which may not attract growth or income-focused investors. The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat is positive but may already be priced in. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong historical performance and positive earnings expectations versus limited short-term growth potential\u2014the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to a rise due to overall positive sentiment and 'Buy' consensus rating.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years.

Considering the positive earnings expectations, historical performance, and the 'Buy' consensus rating, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. But given the limited upside potential and modest dividend yield, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's impressive historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years.

Considering the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper significant gains. The predictions from other models also suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, with an average probability of around 0.58. Taking into account the mixed signals and the modest upside potential, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.57 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.43.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's impressive historical performance, showing a significant return on investment over the past decade. The upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report is anticipated to show growth in EPS and revenue, which could positively influence investor sentiment. The modest expected upside of 4% and the low dividend yield may not attract growth-focused and income-focused investors respectively. Despite these factors, the strong historical performance and positive earnings expectations suggest a higher probability of stock price rise. The trend in previous predictions indicates a moderate optimism, with most models estimating a higher probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's impressive historical performance, showcasing a significant return on investment over the past decade.

The consensus 'Buy' rating and strong historical performance suggest a higher probability of a price rise. However, the limited near-term growth potential and the lack of significantly new information temper this.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a slight bullish bias but with probabilities clustered around 0.55-0.6, I'm assigning a probability slightly weighted towards a rise, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price predictions and the potential for the market to already have priced in the positive earnings expectations.
