Generally, if the earnings report exceeds market expectations, it can lead to a rise in stock price, while disappointing results can lead to a decline. Given the context of the broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and pending home sales data, there may be a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance often lead to positive reactions unless the earnings are significantly below expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if the earnings report is disappointing.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
