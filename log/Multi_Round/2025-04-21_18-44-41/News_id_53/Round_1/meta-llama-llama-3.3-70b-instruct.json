A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that can influence stock price movement. Generally, if the earnings report exceeds market expectations, it can lead to a rise in stock price, while disappointing results can lead to a decline. Given the context of the broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and pending home sales data, there may be a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance often lead to positive reactions unless the earnings are significantly below expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if the earnings report is disappointing.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight several factors influencing Apple's stock price. Firstly, Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings report. The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment and potentially affect Apple's stock. However, the overall impact is difficult to predict without knowing the actual earnings figures. Given the mixed signals (earnings release vs. slowing GDP), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative. Since the news doesn't give any indication of whether the earnings will be positive or negative, I will assume a neutral stance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report alongside several other companies and macroeconomic data releases.  The article itself provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance, only that they will be releasing earnings.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is uncertain.  The probability of a price rise or fall is largely dependent on the actual earnings report and how the market reacts to it.  Given the lack of directional information in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside other major tech and financial companies. Earnings reports are critical events that can significantly impact stock prices based on whether the company meets, exceeds, or falls short of market expectations. Additionally, the release of Q4 GDP data and pending home sales figures could influence broader market sentiment, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a reasonable chance of positive earnings, but uncertainty remains due to macroeconomic factors like slowing GDP growth and interest rate dynamics. The probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a positive outcome given Apple's strong track record.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a key event that can influence the stock price. The article also mentions that several other companies are releasing their quarterly earnings results, and economic data such as Q4 GDP and new pending home sales will be released. However, there is no specific information in the headline or article that would lead to a strongly positive or negative outlook for Apple. As a result, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. Given that earnings reports can sometimes beat expectations and sometimes disappoint, and considering the general market events, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.55 and falling at 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings results, which can have a significant impact on the stock price. However, the article does not provide any specific information about the expected earnings results or any other factors that could influence the stock price. Additionally, the article mentions the release of Q4 GDP data and new pending home sales data, which can have a broader impact on the market but may not directly affect Apple's stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's earnings, it is difficult to estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling. However, considering that earnings reports can be a significant catalyst for stock price movements, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising due to potential positive earnings results.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to release its quarterly earnings report, which is expected to provide detailed insights into the company's financial performance for the recent quarter. The market will closely analyze these earnings for any positive or negative indicators about the company's future prospects. Additionally, the release of fourth-quarter GDP data and home sales data could indirectly impact investor sentiment regarding the broader economy and specific sectors like housing. These factors combined suggest a high probability of significant stock price movement based on the earnings report.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
