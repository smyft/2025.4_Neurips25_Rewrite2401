A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that can influence stock price movement. Generally, if the earnings report exceeds market expectations, it can lead to a rise in stock price, while disappointing results can lead to a decline. Given the context of the broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and pending home sales data, there may be a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance often lead to positive reactions unless the earnings are significantly below expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if the earnings report is disappointing.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight several factors influencing Apple's stock price. Firstly, Apple is releasing its quarterly earnings report. The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment and potentially affect Apple's stock. However, the overall impact is difficult to predict without knowing the actual earnings figures. Given the mixed signals (earnings release vs. slowing GDP), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative. Since the news doesn't give any indication of whether the earnings will be positive or negative, I will assume a neutral stance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report alongside several other companies and macroeconomic data releases.  The article itself provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance, only that they will be releasing earnings.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is uncertain.  The probability of a price rise or fall is largely dependent on the actual earnings report and how the market reacts to it.  Given the lack of directional information in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside other major tech and financial companies. Earnings reports are critical events that can significantly impact stock prices based on whether the company meets, exceeds, or falls short of market expectations. Additionally, the release of Q4 GDP data and pending home sales figures could influence broader market sentiment, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a reasonable chance of positive earnings, but uncertainty remains due to macroeconomic factors like slowing GDP growth and interest rate dynamics. The probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a positive outcome given Apple's strong track record.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a key event that can influence the stock price. The article also mentions that several other companies are releasing their quarterly earnings results, and economic data such as Q4 GDP and new pending home sales will be released. However, there is no specific information in the headline or article that would lead to a strongly positive or negative outlook for Apple. As a result, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. Given that earnings reports can sometimes beat expectations and sometimes disappoint, and considering the general market events, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.55 and falling at 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings results, which can have a significant impact on the stock price. However, the article does not provide any specific information about the expected earnings results or any other factors that could influence the stock price. Additionally, the article mentions the release of Q4 GDP data and new pending home sales data, which can have a broader impact on the market but may not directly affect Apple's stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's earnings, it is difficult to estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling. However, considering that earnings reports can be a significant catalyst for stock price movements, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising due to potential positive earnings results.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to release its quarterly earnings report, which is expected to provide detailed insights into the company's financial performance for the recent quarter. The market will closely analyze these earnings for any positive or negative indicators about the company's future prospects. Additionally, the release of fourth-quarter GDP data and home sales data could indirectly impact investor sentiment regarding the broader economy and specific sectors like housing. These factors combined suggest a high probability of significant stock price movement based on the earnings report.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that can greatly influence stock price movement. Given the mixed signals from the broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and pending home sales data, there is a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance often lead to positive reactions unless the earnings are significantly below expectations. Considering the previous predictions, which range from neutral to slightly positive, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if the earnings report is disappointing.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The primary driver for Apple's stock price movement in this scenario is the upcoming earnings report. The Q4 GDP data and home sales figures introduce broader economic context, but the earnings report will likely have a more direct and pronounced impact. Given the previous rounds' predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a positive outcome, likely reflecting Apple's generally strong performance history. However, the range of predictions (from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise) indicates considerable uncertainty. I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly more cautious outlook, acknowledging the potential for disappointment and the slowing GDP growth. Also, the previous rounds' predictions are quite varied, suggesting no strong consensus or insider information leaning heavily in one direction. Therefore, I will slightly reduce the probability of a rise compared to the highest prediction in the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news piece highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key market event, alongside macroeconomic data releases (Q4 GDP and pending home sales).  While the macroeconomic data could influence overall market sentiment, the earnings report will be the primary driver of Apple's stock price movement. Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 probability of a price rise.  The lack of specific information about Apple's expected earnings in the news itself makes a precise prediction difficult. However, considering Apple's generally strong performance and the tendency for earnings reports to be significant market movers, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty. The previous predictions show a slight bias towards a price rise, but the range is wide enough to suggest significant uncertainty. I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly to reflect this uncertainty and the potential for negative surprises.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a significant event that can influence stock price movement. The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Additionally, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, and pending home sales data could impact broader market sentiment, indirectly affecting Apple's stock. Given Apple's strong historical performance and brand strength, there is a reasonable chance of positive earnings, but uncertainty remains due to macroeconomic factors. The previous predictions from other models show a slight tilt towards a positive outcome, with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise and 0.3 to 0.45 for a fall. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of specific earnings data in the news, I estimate a balanced but slightly positive probability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report, along with other major tech and financial companies, and the release of Q4 GDP data and pending home sales figures. The earnings report is a significant event that can impact the stock price based on whether it meets, exceeds, or falls short of market expectations. Given Apple's strong brand and historical performance, there is a cautious optimism that could lead to a positive stock price movement if the earnings report is favorable. However, the slowing GDP growth and interest rate dynamics could contribute to a negative outlook. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, assuming the earnings report could potentially exceed expectations or show resilience in a challenging economic environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key event that can influence the stock price. While the article does not provide specific information about the expected earnings results, the historical performance and market position of Apple suggest a reasonable chance of positive earnings. However, the release of Q4 GDP data and pending home sales figures could influence broader market sentiment and indirectly affect Apple's stock. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of directional information in the news, I will assign a balanced probability to the stock price rising or falling. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a range of opinions, with some models favoring a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to potential positive earnings results. Taking into account the overall uncertainty and the potential impact of macroeconomic factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising at 0.52 and falling at 0.48.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report, as well as the release of Q4 GDP data and new pending home sales figures. While the GDP data suggests a slowing economy, which might negatively impact market sentiment, the earnings report is the most direct factor influencing Apple's stock price. Historical performance and strong brand loyalty suggest a potential for positive earnings, but the market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual results. Considering the mixed signals and prior predictions, the probabilities appear balanced, leaning slightly towards a positive outcome.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant event that can greatly influence stock price movement. Given the mixed signals from broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and pending home sales data, there is a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance often lead to positive reactions unless the earnings are significantly below expectations. The previous predictions show a slight tilt towards a positive outcome, with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise and 0.3 to 0.45 for a fall. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if the earnings report is disappointing.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The primary driver for Apple's stock price movement is the upcoming earnings report. The Q4 GDP data and home sales figures introduce broader economic context, but the earnings report will likely have a more direct and pronounced impact. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a positive outcome, likely reflecting Apple's generally strong performance history. However, the range of predictions (from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise) indicates considerable uncertainty.

Therefore, I will slightly reduce the probability of a rise compared to the highest prediction in the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report, a major event that will significantly influence its stock price.  The report's impact will depend on whether it meets or exceeds expectations.  Macroeconomic factors like slowing GDP growth and pending home sales data add uncertainty, potentially dampening overall market sentiment.  However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance suggest resilience. Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a range of opinions, with a slight bias towards a price rise (averaging around 0.55 probability of a rise).  This suggests considerable uncertainty, and no strong consensus or insider information heavily influencing the predictions.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings reports, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a balanced outlook, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's historical strength, but acknowledging the potential for negative surprises given the macroeconomic context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is a significant event that can influence stock price movement.

The earnings report is a significant event that can impact the stock price based on whether it meets, exceeds, or falls short of market expectations. Considering Apple's strong brand and historical performance, there is a cautious optimism that could lead to a positive stock price movement if the earnings report is favorable. However, the slowing GDP growth and interest rate dynamics could contribute to a negative outlook. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with probabilities for a stock price rise ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 and for a fall from 0.3 to 0.48. Given this uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, I estimate a balanced but slightly positive probability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report, a significant event that can influence stock price movement.

The trend of the previous predictions is slightly decreasing, so I will also take this into consideration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report as a key driver of its stock price movement.  While macroeconomic factors like slowing GDP growth and pending home sales data introduce uncertainty and could negatively impact overall market sentiment, Apple's strong brand and historical performance suggest a degree of resilience.  The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with a slight overall bias towards a price rise (averaging around 0.55 probability of a rise). This range indicates considerable uncertainty and the absence of a strong consensus or insider information heavily influencing the predictions.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings reports, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a balanced outlook, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's historical strength, but acknowledging the potential for negative surprises given the macroeconomic context and the possibility of the earnings falling short of expectations.
