A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock has risen following the announcement of better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance. Positive earnings reports typically lead to increased investor confidence, which often results in a rise in stock price. Given the context of the news, the probability of the stock price rising is significantly higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and provided positive growth guidance. This suggests strong financial performance and positive future prospects, which typically lead to increased investor confidence and a higher stock price. While broader market conditions and other factors can influence the stock price, the positive earnings report and guidance are strong indicators of upward momentum.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight that Apple posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a positive growth outlook.  This is generally considered positive news for the stock. While other companies are mentioned, the focus on Apple's positive performance suggests a higher likelihood of a price increase for AAPL.  The probability estimates are subjective and based on the limited information provided.  A more comprehensive analysis would require examining the specifics of the earnings report, analyst reactions, and overall market conditions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity, which drives the stock price higher. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth, which typically has a positive impact on stock prices. The news headline and content suggest that Apple's stock performance was a highlight among the companies mentioned, with the stock rising as a result. Given this positive financial report, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news states that Apple stock rises after the tech giant posts better-than-expected earnings and guides for solid growth. This indicates a positive sentiment towards the company's financial performance, which is likely to boost investor confidence and lead to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple's stock is likely to rise given the news that it posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth, which are positive indicators for the stock price. On the other hand, Chevron's stock fell as its earnings were below expectations, which is a negative indicator.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which typically boosts investor confidence and leads to an increase in stock price. The consensus among previous predictions is overwhelmingly positive, with probabilities of rising stock prices ranging from 0.7 to 0.85. Given the strong performance and positive outlook, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The consensus from the previous round is strongly bullish on Apple (AAPL) due to better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance. All models predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising. Given this strong positive signal and the lack of any contradictory information, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising, reflecting the confidence in the positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates that Apple's stock rose following better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance.  All previous models agree on a higher probability of a price rise. While external factors could influence the stock price, the strong positive news from the earnings report significantly increases the likelihood of continued upward momentum in the short term. The consensus among previous models, ranging from 0.7 to 0.85 for the probability of a price rise, supports this assessment. I'm adjusting slightly upward to reflect the strong consensus and the immediate positive market reaction reported in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which has already led to a rise in its stock price. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth projections typically boost investor confidence, leading to further upward momentum in the stock price. The consensus from previous predictions also supports a high probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a 70-85% chance of an increase. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is significantly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth, which are positive indicators for the stock price.

Considering this information, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be high, while the probability of it falling is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth, which are strong positive indicators. Multiple models and analyses provided in previous rounds also predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to these optimistic financial results. While other companies' stock movements might influence market dynamics, the specific positive news about Apple's earnings and growth guidance contribute significantly to the expected upward momentum of AAPL's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
