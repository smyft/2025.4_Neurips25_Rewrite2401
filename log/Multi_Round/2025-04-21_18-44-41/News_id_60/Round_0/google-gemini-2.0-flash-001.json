(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. The concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market, and the absence of compelling AI applications are significant headwinds. The 25% and 17% drop in Apple exports to China in recent quarters further reinforces the negative outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released soon, the downgrade suggests that Oppenheimer anticipates disappointing results or guidance, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. The elimination of the $250 price target is also a strong negative signal. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
