      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's future sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, where competition is intensifying and sales are declining. The reduction in sales and earnings estimates further indicates a bearish outlook. Given these factors, along with the upcoming earnings report which may reflect these challenges, it is likely that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. The concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market, and the absence of compelling AI applications are significant headwinds. The 25% and 17% drop in Apple exports to China in recent quarters further reinforces the negative outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released soon, the downgrade suggests that Oppenheimer anticipates disappointing results or guidance, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. The elimination of the $250 price target is also a strong negative signal. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform, coupled with reduced sales and EPS estimates, significantly increases the likelihood of a stock price decline.  The cited reasons \u2013 slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI-related applications to drive upgrades \u2013 are substantial headwinds.  While the market may have already partially priced in some negative sentiment, the downgrade itself is a strong negative catalyst. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, but the pre-announcement negative news increases the probability of the report confirming or even worsening the concerns.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise in the short term.  However, it's important to note that Apple is a large, established company, and the market reaction might be less dramatic than for a smaller, more volatile company.  The probability estimates reflect a cautious outlook based on the provided information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to concerns over slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a 25% drop in exports to China and a delayed iPhone replacement cycle. Additionally, the lack of compelling AI apps to drive near-term upgrades is seen as a negative factor. Given the downgrade and lowered expectations, investor sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted in the short term, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to drive near-term device upgrades. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. This negative outlook suggests that the stock price may fall. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in these concerns, and the actual earnings report on Thursday may surprise investors positively, leading to a potential rise in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, which are significant factors for the company's performance. With reduced sales forecasts and lower earnings per share projections, investor sentiment is likely to be negatively affected. The downgrade and lowered price estimate further indicate a pessimistic outlook, likely leading to a decrease in demand for the stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer highlights significant concerns regarding the company's future sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market where competition is intensifying and sales are declining. The reduction in sales and earnings estimates further indicates a bearish outlook. The reported drop in exports to China and the potential delay in the iPhone replacement cycle due to sluggish adoption of Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps are substantial headwinds. Given these factors, along with the upcoming earnings report which may reflect these challenges, it is likely that investor sentiment will be negatively impacted, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds strongly indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock due to the Oppenheimer downgrade, citing slowing iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of compelling AI applications. The reduced sales and EPS estimates further reinforce this bearish sentiment. While a positive surprise in the upcoming earnings report is possible, the pre-announcement downgrade and negative data points make a price fall more probable. Considering the consistent predictions from various models in the previous round, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more pessimistic view, acknowledging the potential for a minor positive surprise but emphasizing the overall negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with significantly reduced sales and EPS estimates, points to a substantial weakening in Apple's near-term outlook.  The concerns about slowing iPhone sales, especially the dramatic drop in Chinese exports, and the lack of compelling AI applications to drive upgrades are serious issues. While the market may have partially anticipated some slowdown, the downgrade and revised estimates represent a concrete negative catalyst.  The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price drop, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 probability.  While Apple's earnings report could offer a surprise, the pre-announcement negative news significantly increases the likelihood of the report confirming or worsening the concerns.  Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a price fall, though slightly less extreme than the previous models, acknowledging Apple's size and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, pointing to a 25% drop in exports to China and a delayed iPhone replacement cycle. Additionally, the lack of compelling AI apps to drive near-term upgrades is seen as a negative factor. Given the downgrade and lowered expectations, investor sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted in the short term, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. While there is a small chance that the market has already priced in some of these concerns or that the earnings report could surprise positively, the overall sentiment from the news and previous predictions suggests a bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, particularly citing a significant drop in exports to China and a lack of compelling AI applications to drive upgrades. These factors, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, suggest a negative short-term outlook for the stock price. The downgrade and lowered expectations indicate a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. However, it's also possible that the market has already priced in some of these concerns, and Apple's earnings report could potentially surprise investors positively. Considering these aspects, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Apple's downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings per share estimates, indicates a negative outlook for the company's stock. The downgrade itself and the elimination of the $250 price target are strong negative signals. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, it's likely that the market has not fully priced in these concerns yet. The upcoming earnings report may further confirm or worsen these concerns, leading to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Therefore, based on the provided information and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising and a high probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer, reduced sales and earnings expectations, and competitive pressures in the Chinese market. The market response is expected to be negative given the combination of these factors. Previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Although there could be some positive surprises in the upcoming earnings report, the overall negative sentiment is strong. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
