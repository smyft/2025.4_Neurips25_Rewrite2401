A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Broadcom's impressive financial performance and growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector, which is likely to positively influence investor sentiment. Although the news primarily focuses on Broadcom, it indirectly benefits Apple due to its involvement in AI and semiconductor demand. The bullish outlook from Citi with a $220 price target for Broadcom suggests a strong market confidence that could spill over to Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong performance and future prospects, driven by the AI boom. While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a customer contributing to Broadcom's growth, the primary focus is on Broadcom's success. The positive news about Broadcom indirectly suggests a positive outlook for Apple, as it indicates Apple is investing in AI technologies that utilize Broadcom's products. However, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be less direct and less significant than the impact on Broadcom's stock. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock rising is moderately positive, but not overwhelmingly so. There's always a chance of a market correction or other company-specific news overshadowing this indirect positive influence, hence the non-zero probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong performance and future outlook driven by AI.  While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a customer contributing to Broadcom's success, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and less significant than the direct impact on Broadcom.  The news is positive for Broadcom, suggesting strong growth in the AI sector. However, this positive news for Broadcom doesn't directly translate to a significant probability of a price increase for Apple.  The connection is tenuous; Apple's success is not solely dependent on Broadcom's performance.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of a minor positive movement due to the overall positive sentiment surrounding the AI sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) strong performance, particularly in AI-related revenue, and its positive outlook, which is bolstered by significant investments from major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Apple. Although the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of the companies contributing to Broadcom's growth, it does not provide specific information about Apple's own financial performance or any direct impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, the news is more relevant to Broadcom than to Apple. Given the lack of direct implications for Apple's stock in this news, the probabilities of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news are neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's strong financial performance, driven by its AI business, and its potential for future growth. Although the article does not directly discuss Apple's financial performance, it mentions Apple as one of the companies driving demand for Broadcom's products. Given the positive tone of the article and the potential indirect benefit to Apple, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling. However, since the news is primarily about Broadcom and not Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's strong financial performance and future projections, driven by significant growth in AI-related revenue. It also mentions increased investments from major tech companies such as Google and Meta, which is expected to boost Broadcom's stock. Although there is a mention of some risks associated with Bytedance, the overall tone is positive, with Citi maintaining a 'Buy' rating and a target price of $220. This suggests a high probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Broadcom's impressive financial performance and growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector, which is likely to positively influence investor sentiment. Although the news is centered on Broadcom, it indirectly benefits Apple due to its involvement in AI and semiconductor demand. The bullish outlook from Citi with a $220 price target for Broadcom suggests strong market confidence that could spill over to Apple. However, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be less direct and significant than the impact on Broadcom's stock. Therefore, while there is a positive sentiment surrounding the AI sector that could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price, the probabilities reflect a more cautious optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's impressive AI-driven growth and its positive impact on companies like Apple. While the primary beneficiary is Broadcom, the article explicitly mentions Apple as a driver of Broadcom's ASIC sales, indicating Apple's investment in AI. The previous rounds show a range of predictions, with some models assigning a higher probability of a rise and others being more neutral. Considering the positive sentiment surrounding AI and Apple's involvement, I'm leaning towards a positive, but not overly aggressive, impact on Apple's stock. The mention of Apple as a customer for Broadcom's AI solutions is a key factor. The higher predictions in the previous rounds also suggest a positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news is primarily about Broadcom's strong performance in the AI sector, driven by increased demand from major tech companies including Apple. While the news is positive for Broadcom, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and likely to be less significant.  The positive sentiment surrounding Broadcom's growth in AI could have a spillover effect on Apple, as it suggests strong demand for AI-related components. However, this effect is likely to be muted, given that the news doesn't contain any specific information about Apple's performance or future prospects.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from a 20% to an 80% probability of a price rise for AAPL, and the indirect nature of the news's impact, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned. The probability of a price fall is relatively low, as the overall sentiment is positive for the AI sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong financial performance and growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector, with significant contributions from major tech companies including Apple (AAPL). While the news is overwhelmingly positive for Broadcom, its direct impact on Apple's stock is indirect and less significant. The mention of Apple as a customer contributing to Broadcom's growth suggests a positive outlook for Apple's involvement in AI, but the lack of specific financial data or direct implications for Apple limits the potential impact. Given the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector and Apple's indirect benefit from Broadcom's success, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is moderately higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) strong financial performance and growth prospects in the AI sector, with significant investments from major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Apple. While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a customer contributing to Broadcom's growth, the focus is on Broadcom's success. The positive outlook for Broadcom indirectly suggests a favorable environment for Apple, given its involvement in AI and demand for Broadcom's products. However, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be less direct and moderate. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is moderately positive, with a higher chance of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Broadcom's strong financial performance and future outlook, driven by its AI business. Although Apple is mentioned as a customer contributing to Broadcom's growth, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect. Considering the positive tone of the article and the potential indirect benefit to Apple, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling. However, since the news is primarily about Broadcom and not Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. The predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most suggest a slightly positive or neutral outlook for Apple's stock.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Broadcom's impressive financial performance and growth prospects in the AI sector, which is likely to have an indirect positive influence on companies like Apple that are involved in AI and semiconductor demand. The bullish outlook from Citi with a $220 price target for Broadcom suggests strong market confidence that could positively affect Apple's stock indirectly. However, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be less direct compared to Broadcom's. Some models predict a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising, while others highlight the limited direct impact of this news on Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
