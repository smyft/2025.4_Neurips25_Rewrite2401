While this might initially suggest a continued downward trend, the question posed in the headline ('Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?') introduces an element of potential future upside. The market's interpretation of this sell-off is crucial. If investors believe the fundamentals of Apple remain strong and the sell-off is an overreaction, buying pressure could increase, leading to a price rise. However, if the market perceives underlying problems or anticipates further negative news, the price could continue to fall. Given the ambiguity and the potential for both scenarios, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall in the short term, but acknowledging the possibility of a rebound.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
