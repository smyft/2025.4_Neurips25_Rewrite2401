(AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend for the stock. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, implying potential for recovery. The negative performance trend might increase the likelihood of a continued stock price fall. Nonetheless, the mention of a potential buying opportunity could counterbalance the negative sentiment, suggesting some investors might see this as a chance to buy at a lower price, which could stabilize or increase the stock price. Given these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.4 and the probability of it falling as 0.6.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
