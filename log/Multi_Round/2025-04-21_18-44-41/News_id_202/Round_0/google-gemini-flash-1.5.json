However, the headline also poses the question of whether this is a buying opportunity. This implies uncertainty in the market's future assessment of Apple. While the underperformance is a negative factor, the question itself suggests some analysts believe the current price might undervalue the stock.  Therefore, the probabilities are not strongly skewed towards either a rise or fall, but rather reflect a degree of uncertainty and potential for both outcomes.
