The question posed in the headline ('Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?') implies that some investors might see the current low price as a chance to buy, potentially leading to a rebound. However, the sell-off could also indicate underlying issues (e.g., weak demand, competitive pressures, or macroeconomic factors) that may continue to weigh on the stock. Given the mixed sentiment, the probability of a rise or fall is balanced but slightly skewed toward a potential rebound if investors perceive the sell-off as overdone.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
