(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Tumble 4% After Double Downgrades by Analysts\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financial) shares tumbled more than 4% on Tuesday after analysts across the board downgraded the stock, citing mounting worries about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services.\n\nApple was downgraded to underperform from hold by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. However, Lee said the downgrade reflected weakening demand for the iPhone, particularly in major foreign markets such as China. However, efforts to boost sales with new models, such as the budget-friendly iPhone SE, have not really gotten buy-in in an increasingly crowded smartphone market, which has raised doubts about revenue growth.\n\nLast week, Barclays also downgraded Apple to an underweight from an equal weight rating, warning of poor iPhone 15 sales and anticipating more of the same with the iPhone 16. It also long condemned Apple's product lineup as not innovative enough, which, he said, had dulled consumer interest and buying momentum.\n\nApple's hardware business, of course, extends beyond smartphones, and it also has headwinds. Declining sales of MacBooks and iPads were also a long pointer to bigger problems in the company's hardware arm, a historically lucrative revenue generator.\n\nGrowing skepticism of Apple's ability to keep its growth well intact in the face of changing market conditions led to these downgrades. Meanwhile, analysts remain wary of Apple's near-term performance as it grapples with intensifying competition and economic pressures, a selling factor in recent weakness.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment surrounding Apple due to double downgrades by analysts, which typically leads to a decrease in investor confidence. The downgrades were based on concerns about sagging iPhone sales and a lack of innovation in Apple's product lineup, which are critical factors for the company's revenue. The immediate market reaction was a 4% drop in share price, suggesting that the market is responding negatively to these concerns. Given the context of declining sales and increased competition, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling further rather than rising in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two analyst downgrades, citing weak iPhone sales (both current and anticipated future models), lack of innovation, and declining sales in other hardware categories (MacBooks and iPads) all point towards a likely decrease in stock price. The downgrades from Jefferies and Barclays carry weight, and the specific concerns about iPhone sales in key markets like China are significant. While Apple is a large and resilient company, the combination of these factors suggests a higher probability of a price decrease in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment towards Apple's stock. Two major analysts, Jefferies and Barclays, have downgraded Apple's rating, citing weakening iPhone sales, lack of innovation, and poor performance in other hardware segments.  The 4% drop in share price immediately following the downgrades reflects the market's immediate reaction to this negative news. While Apple's long-term prospects might remain strong, the short-term outlook appears bearish given the analysts' concerns about current sales trends and the competitive landscape.  The consensus points towards a continued downward trend in the near future, although the extent of the fall is uncertain.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than the probability of a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over weakening iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and insufficient innovation in Apple's product lineup. The downgrades from reputable firms like Jefferies and Barclays, along with the 4% drop in stock price, indicate strong negative sentiment. The mention of declining sales in key markets like China and broader hardware segments (MacBooks, iPads) further reinforces the bearish outlook. Given the immediate market reaction and the credibility of the analysts' concerns, the probability of further decline is elevated in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to double downgrades by analysts. The downgrades cite concerns over sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and intensifying competition. Specifically, Jefferies and Barclays have downgraded Apple's stock, citing weakening demand for iPhones, particularly in major markets like China, and expressing doubts about revenue growth. Given this negative sentiment from influential analysts, it is likely that the stock price will experience downward pressure. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price has already tumbled 4% after double downgrades by analysts, citing concerns about sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and intensifying competition. The downgrades and negative analyst comments suggest a bearish outlook for the company's near-term performance. Additionally, the article mentions declining sales of MacBooks and iPads, which further contributes to the negative sentiment. Based on this information, it is likely that the stock price will continue to fall in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news reports significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by key analysts due to concerns over sagging iPhone sales, declining sales of other hardware products like MacBooks and iPads, and perceived lack of innovation. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for the stock. Given the recent downgrade and the context provided, it is reasonable to expect continued pressure on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
