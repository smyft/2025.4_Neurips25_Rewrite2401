(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle\nNews Content: From 2015 to 2021, Apple saw a three-year cycle for iPhone sales, with 2015, 2018 and 2021 being the high-water years. When questioned on the product cycle and the average life of products during Thursday's earnings call, Cook chose to focus on the opportunity ahead: \"I think it's different for different types of users,\" he said. \"And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the Covid period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company for more than one of the product categories.\"\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The article highlights a historical three-year cycle of peak iPhone sales, which might be disrupted. Cook's response, while optimistic, doesn't directly address the cycle concern, potentially fueling uncertainty. The focus on 'opportunity' and a broad reference to Covid-era sales suggest a potential deviation from past trends, without concrete information on performance. This ambiguity carries a slightly negative outlook, increasing the probability of the stock falling relative to rising. The lack of clear information has more people expecting it to drop slightly than rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Missing Refresh Cycle\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
