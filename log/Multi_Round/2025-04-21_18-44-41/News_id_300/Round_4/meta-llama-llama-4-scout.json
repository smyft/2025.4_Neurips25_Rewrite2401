(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Company -- and It's Not Nvidia\nNews Content: Change is perhaps the only certainty on Wall Street. Due to factors such as innovation, competition, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and legal judgments, the puzzle pieces that make up the largest publicly traded companies are constantly in flux.\n\nWhen 2004 came to a close, ExxonMobil was the largest publicly traded company in the S&P 500, with Citigroup and General Electric also in the top 10. Today, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the only member of the end-of-2004 top 10 that's still among America's largest publicly traded companies.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2023, we've witnessed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all surpass the $3 trillion valuation plateau. Although Nvidia would seem like the surest bet to reach the psychologically important $5 trillion level given the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a dark-horse candidate may have the clearest path to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nNvidia is battling against history, which has a flawless track record\n\nOn one hand, there's no denying that Nvidia has enjoyed a textbook operating expansion. The company's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their high-compute data centers.\n\nWith demand for GPUs overwhelming supply, Nvidia has been able to command $30,000 to $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU. Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidia's gross margin to as high as 78.4% last year.\n\nWhile the long-term outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has real-world applications in most industries around the globe, Nvidia's chances of becoming Wall Street's first $5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers. Though the internet did, eventually, alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way, it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels.\n\nIncluding the internet, every game-changing technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology/innovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility. With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how they'll maximize the return on their AI investments, it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia, the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest. Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a $5 trillion valuation first.Image source: Amazon.\n\nThis dark-horse candidate has a clear path to become America's largest public company\n\nIf history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts, it would also be bad news for Microsoft, which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligence-driven future. Although Microsoft's operating cash flow isn't as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia, being the first to reach a $5 trillion valuation would be a stretch.\n\nThe same can be said for Wall Street's other $3 trillion public company, Apple. Though Apple's Services segment continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, its physical device sales, including iPhone, have stagnated for two years. Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade, which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another $1.4 trillion.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" component that appears to have the clearest path to a $5 trillion market cap is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhen most consumers and investors hear the Amazon name, they think of its dominant online marketplace. Last February, eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2024. While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades, e-commerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income.\n\nThe lion's share of Amazon's growth potential (specifically growth in cash flow) originates from its ancillary operating segments, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) at the front of the pack.\n\nBased on data from tech-analysis firm Canalys, AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 33% share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024. For context, Amazon's share of spending among cloud-service providers is more than Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, combined \u2014 and these are the No's 2 and 3 in global cloud-service spending.\n\nEven though AI has played a role in AWS's growth, enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady double-digit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. With enterprise cloud-service spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion, Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon's advertising services and subscription services (e.g., Prime) segments are also respectively growing by double digits. Amazon's push into exclusive sporting events (Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages) should improve demand for advertising, as well as support its subscription pricing power.\n\nThe key point is that, unlike Microsoft and Nvidia, Amazon wouldn't be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts.\n\nLastly, Amazon remains historically inexpensive. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of the company. But as of the closing bell on Jan. 10, Amazon's shares are valued at just 13.5 times consensus cash flow for 2026. If Amazon were to reach the median year-end multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019, it would become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential for Apple Inc. to become the first $5 trillion company, but it also highlights challenges such as stagnating iPhone sales and high current valuations. While the overall sentiment is somewhat positive regarding Apple's long-term prospects, the mention of its high valuation and stagnation in device sales suggests a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to these concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the potential for Amazon (AMZN) to reach a $5 trillion valuation before Apple (AAPL) or Nvidia (NVDA). While the article mentions Apple, it primarily uses it as a comparison point to highlight Amazon's strengths and potential. The article suggests that Apple's growth has stagnated and its valuation is already high, implying limited upside. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Apple as it suggests that other companies have better growth prospects. However, the article doesn't explicitly state that Apple's stock will fall, but rather that its potential for significant growth is limited compared to Amazon. Given the overall context, the probability of a slight negative impact is higher than a positive one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article focuses on the potential for Amazon (AMZN) to become the first $5 trillion company, arguing that its diverse revenue streams (AWS, advertising, subscriptions) make it less vulnerable to an AI bubble burst than Nvidia or Microsoft.  While the article mentions Apple and its relatively high valuation leaving little room for significant growth, it doesn't present any specific negative news directly impacting Apple's stock price.  The article's main argument is comparative, highlighting Amazon's strengths relative to other tech giants. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in either direction.  Any movement would likely be due to broader market trends rather than the article's content.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, though it suggests Amazon (AMZN) as a more likely candidate due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high valuation as potential hurdles, while emphasizing Amazon's strong position in cloud services and other high-growth segments. Given the mixed sentiment and the focus on Amazon as the primary beneficiary, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other companies to reach a $5 trillion valuation. It highlights Amazon (AMZN) as a dark-horse candidate with a clear path to becoming America's largest public company due to its diversified growth segments, including AWS, advertising, and subscription services. The article suggests that Apple's stock is already trading at a high valuation and its physical device sales have stagnated, making it less likely to reach the $5 trillion mark first. On the other hand, Amazon's multiple growth segments and relatively low valuation make it an attractive candidate to reach this milestone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, with Amazon being considered a dark-horse candidate. The article highlights Amazon's diverse revenue streams, including its cloud infrastructure service platform AWS, advertising services, and subscription services, which are expected to drive growth and increase cash flow. The article also notes that Amazon's valuation is relatively low compared to its historical multiples, making it an attractive candidate to reach a $5 trillion valuation. In contrast, Nvidia's reliance on the AI bubble and Microsoft's and Apple's already high valuations make them less likely to reach a $5 trillion valuation first.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Nvidia might not be the first to reach the $5 trillion valuation, and it might be impacted by the AI bubble. Amazon, on the other hand, is highlighted as having a clearer path to a $5 trillion market cap due to its robust cloud services and other growth segments. The article implies that Apple's valuation is already quite high and growth might be limited.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. to become the first $5 trillion company but emphasizes challenges such as stagnating iPhone sales and high current valuations. While there is some positive sentiment regarding Apple's long-term prospects, the focus on Amazon as a more likely candidate for reaching the $5 trillion mark suggests a cautious outlook for Apple. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the mention of Apple's high valuation and stagnant growth, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Amazon's potential to reach a $5 trillion valuation, while mentioning Apple's stagnating device sales and high valuation as potential hurdles. The previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the comparative analysis favoring Amazon. However, one model predicted a high probability of stock price rise, possibly indicating some positive information. Considering the overall context and the trend of previous predictions, I believe the news is slightly negative for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The article doesn't explicitly predict a fall, but suggests limited upside compared to Amazon.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Amazon's potential to become the first $5 trillion company, largely downplaying Apple's chances due to its high valuation and stagnant iPhone sales. While the article doesn't contain explicitly negative news about Apple, the comparative analysis positions Apple less favorably than Amazon.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 30% to 70% probability of a price rise. Considering the lack of positive news directly impacting Apple and the overall negative sentiment towards its growth potential relative to Amazon, a neutral to slightly negative impact is more likely.  The high valuation already baked into the price also limits potential upside. I'm weighting the previous predictions, giving more weight to those that highlight the comparative analysis and Amazon's strength as a counterpoint to Apple's prospects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, but it primarily highlights Amazon (AMZN) as a more likely candidate due to its diversified revenue streams and growth potential. The article mentions Apple's high valuation and stagnating device sales as potential hurdles, which could limit its upside. While the article does not present immediate negative news for Apple, the comparative analysis favoring Amazon suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious outlook, with probabilities leaning slightly towards a fall due to high valuation concerns and stagnant growth in key segments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company but highlights challenges such as stagnating iPhone sales and high current valuations.

However, the question asks for the prediction of Apple's stock price movement. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high valuation as potential hurdles, making it less likely to reach the $5 trillion mark first. Considering the mixed sentiment and the focus on Amazon as the primary beneficiary, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative in the short term. Given the trend of others' beliefs, with most predictions indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

While not explicitly negative, the article positions Apple as less likely to achieve significant growth compared to Amazon. Previous predictions lean towards a negative impact on Apple's stock, citing similar concerns. Considering this comparative analysis and the existing high valuation, the probability of a price decrease is higher than a price increase. The article doesn't present any strong positive catalysts for Apple, reinforcing this view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Amazon's potential to become the first $5 trillion company, directly comparing it to Apple and highlighting Apple's challenges.  These challenges include stagnant iPhone sales and a high current valuation, leaving little room for significant growth. While the article doesn't contain explicitly negative news about Apple, the comparative analysis strongly favors Amazon.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling than rising, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  Considering the lack of positive news for Apple in this specific article and the overall negative sentiment relative to Amazon's prospects, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall.  The already high valuation further limits potential upside.
