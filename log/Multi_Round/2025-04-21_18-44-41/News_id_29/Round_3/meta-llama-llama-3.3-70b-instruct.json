(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is facing challenges in AI innovation and has received a downgrade from Oppenheimer, which impacts market sentiment negatively. The analyst noted a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and slow growth in iPhone replacements, contributing to a lack of confidence in AAPL's future performance. Given these points, along with the overall skepticism regarding AI initiatives mentioned, it suggests a stronger likelihood of stock price decline rather than appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's perceived lack of innovation in AI compared to other companies actively involved in AI development. An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked second on a list of AI stocks, the core of the article focuses on a downgrade by Oppenheimer.  This downgrade cites a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, a lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst's concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and slower iPhone growth significantly outweigh the positive aspects of being included in an AI stock list.  The unrelated discussion about the Stargate AI initiative and the dispute between Musk and Altman is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific performance and outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors impacting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' with a removed price target of $250. The downgrade was based on a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, challenges in the Chinese market, and a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle. Additionally, the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence and the company's lack of generative AI apps compared to competitors were cited as reasons for potential underperformance. These factors collectively suggest a bearish sentiment around AAPL's stock in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles with innovation in AI, citing a recent downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle and little upside to Apple's valuation. These factors contribute to a negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, an analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. This downgrade, combined with the perceived struggles in AI innovation, may lead to a decrease in investor confidence, causing the stock price to fall. However, the article also mentions that Apple Inc. is still a prominent player in the tech industry and has a strong brand, which could mitigate the negative impact. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple related to AI innovation and the company's perceived struggle in this space compared to industry benchmarks. Notable concerns include a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, slower-than-expected growth in iPhone shipments, the absence of significant generative AI offerings, and competitive pressures from other AI-focused companies. The broader context of conflicts involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk and political tensions add to the uncertainties. Given these factors, investor confidence may be negatively impacted, potentially leading to a decline in the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple Inc.'s innovation in the AI sector, as well as a recent downgrade from Oppenheimer which cites a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and challenges related to competition, particularly in regard to AI capabilities. The overall tone of the article suggests that Apple is struggling to keep pace with other companies in this critical sector, which negatively impacts market sentiment. Consequently, these factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price declining rather than appreciating.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans heavily towards a negative stock price movement for Apple (AAPL) following the news headline \"Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI.\" The consistent reasoning points to a downgrade from Oppenheimer citing weak iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation and Chinese market challenges. This is further compounded by a perception of slow growth in iPhone shipments and a lack of generative AI apps which cause a competitive disadvantage. This negative sentiment outweighs any potentially positive news, thus implying a bearish outlook. After looking at previous predictions, the negative outlook has been persistent at 0.7. Therefore, I would only slightly change my prediction but remain largely in line with previous models. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  An Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales forecasts, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, is the most significant factor.  While Apple is included in an AI stock list, its placement and the analyst's concerns significantly overshadow any positive implications. The Stargate initiative, while mentioned, has minimal direct relevance to Apple's performance. The consistent negative sentiment across previous predictions further reinforces this bearish outlook.  The probability of a price fall is therefore considered significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst's concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and slower iPhone growth outweigh the positive aspect of being ranked second on an AI stock list. The unrelated discussion about the Stargate AI initiative and the dispute between Musk and Altman is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific performance and outlook. Collectively, these factors suggest a bearish sentiment around AAPL's stock in the near term, with a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Previous predictions from various models also consistently indicate a higher likelihood of a price decline, reinforcing the negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles with AI innovation, a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. Multiple analysts and models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, citing negative sentiment and lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles with AI innovation, a downgrade by Oppenheimer, and challenges in the Chinese market, all of which contribute to a negative outlook for the company's stock price. The downgrade and lack of AI innovation are significant factors that may impact investor confidence, leading to a potential decline in the stock price. While Apple is still a major player in the tech industry, the current challenges and uncertainties surrounding its AI efforts may outweigh any positive factors, resulting in a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple related to AI innovation and the company's perceived struggle in this space compared to industry benchmarks. Notable concerns include a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, slower-than-expected growth in iPhone shipments, the absence of significant generative AI offerings, and competitive pressures from other AI-focused companies. The broader context of conflicts involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk and political tensions add to the uncertainties. Given these factors, investor confidence may be negatively impacted, potentially leading to a decline in the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc. regarding its innovation in the AI sector, coupled with a downgrade from Oppenheimer citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales. This downgrade, combined with concerns about Apple's perceived lack of AI innovation and competition from other AI-focused companies, negatively affects market sentiment. The consistent negative predictions from various models further reinforce the outlook that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The recurring theme across various analyses is Apple's struggle with AI innovation, highlighted by an Oppenheimer downgrade citing weak iPhone sales, challenges in AI advancement, and issues in the Chinese market. This is further compounded by slow iPhone shipment growth and the absence of prominent generative AI applications, creating a competitive disadvantage. The negative sentiment is consistent across rounds of predictions. Considering this sustained bearish outlook and the limited positive factors, the probability of the stock price falling remains significantly higher than it rising. I'm slightly moderating the most common, extremely negative, sentiment slightly by moving toward a neutral assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales forecasts, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, is the most significant factor.  This is consistent across multiple AI prediction models. While Apple is mentioned in an AI stock list, its ranking and the analyst's concerns significantly overshadow the positive implication.  The Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's direct performance.  The consistent negative sentiment across previous predictions, all hovering around a 70% chance of a price drop, reinforces this bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered significantly higher than a price rise, although the established brand and large existing market share suggests that the fall will be less severe than one might otherwise expect given the negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst's concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and slower iPhone growth outweigh the positive aspect of being ranked second on an AI stock list.

Previous predictions from various models also consistently indicate a higher likelihood of a price decline, reinforcing the negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI' and the accompanying content suggest that Apple is facing significant challenges in AI innovation. A recent downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' cites a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors, combined with the analyst's concerns about a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle and Apple's lack of generative AI apps, contribute to a negative outlook for the stock. The consistent predictions from various models in previous rounds, which heavily favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, further reinforce this bearish sentiment. Therefore, based on the information provided and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles with AI innovation, a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market.

The analyst's concerns about Apple's AI capabilities, slower iPhone growth, and competitive pressures from other AI-focused companies further reinforce the negative sentiment. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple related to AI innovation and the company's perceived struggle in this space compared to industry benchmarks.
