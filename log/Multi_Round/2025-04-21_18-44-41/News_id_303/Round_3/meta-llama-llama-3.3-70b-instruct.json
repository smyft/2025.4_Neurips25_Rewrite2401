(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, which is a significant market for the company. Although Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets, the overall decline in market share and the rise of competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi could negatively impact investor sentiment. The slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18% suggests a trend that may concern investors. Additionally, the stock is already down 0.54% at the time of the report, indicating a negative reaction. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market, while competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining momentum. This is a negative signal. However, the article also mentions Apple's growth in other markets and a consumer shift towards premium iPhones, which partially offsets the negative news. Furthermore, the overall smartphone market is recovering. The article also mentions that Needham expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue. Considering these factors, the negative impact of the China market share loss is somewhat mitigated, but still presents a risk. The current price action shows a slight decrease, suggesting the market is already reacting negatively. Therefore, the probability of a further stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's continued dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The Chinese government's subsidies favoring domestic brands pose a threat, but Apple's premium positioning and brand loyalty could mitigate this impact.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so, as the overall picture isn't overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market, while competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining momentum. This could negatively impact investor sentiment due to concerns over Apple's growth in one of its largest markets. However, the article also notes growth in non-core markets and a consumer pivot to premium offerings, which may offset some declines. Additionally, the broader smartphone market is recovering, and Apple's revenue is still expected to be heavily reliant on iPhones. The mixed signals suggest a slight negative bias due to the China market share loss, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China has declined in 2024, while domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have gained momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple still maintains a strong presence in other markets and that the overall smartphone market is experiencing growth. The mixed impact of these factors leads to a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share has declined in China, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. This decline in market share could potentially negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability. However, the article also mentions that Apple continued to grow in non-core markets and that the company's premium offerings are helping to offset some of the declines. Additionally, the global smartphone sales growth and the expected revenue growth in 2025 could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a decline in iPhone market share in China, where Apple has seen significant competition from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. Despite the global smartphone market showing signs of recovery, Apple's share in its core market has dipped. However, Apple's strong performance in non-core markets and the increasing focus on premium offerings could partly offset these declines. The overall tone of the news is mixed, with a slight negative bias towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market for the company, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. While Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets and a shift towards premium offerings may help offset some of the declines, the overall trend of losing market share to competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi raises concerns. The slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18% suggests a potential ongoing trend that may worry investors. Additionally, the current stock price is already down 0.54%, indicating a negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, but the mixed signals from growth in other markets and premium offerings suggest a moderate outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to declining market share in China. While there are offsetting factors like growth in other markets and a shift towards premium offerings, the China market is crucial. The trend of predictions has remained relatively stable, with a slightly higher probability assigned to the stock price falling. Given this consistency and the continued relevance of the initial negative news, I will maintain a similar outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, especially given China's size.  The rise of Huawei and Xiaomi is a direct competitive threat. However, several mitigating factors exist: growth in other markets, a shift towards higher-margin Pro models, and the overall recovery of the global smartphone market.  The projection of iPhones accounting for a large percentage of Apple's 2025 revenue suggests continued strength.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.  Considering the mixed signals and the already negative market reaction (stock down 0.54%), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the potential for resilience given Apple's overall strength and premium positioning.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market, which is a significant negative factor. Competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining momentum, further pressuring Apple's position. However, Apple's growth in non-core markets and a shift towards premium offerings provide some offsetting positives. The overall global smartphone market is showing recovery, which is a positive signal. The mixed signals from the news, combined with the slight negative bias due to the China market share loss, suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market, while competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining momentum. This decline, coupled with the slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18%, could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets, and there is a consumer shift towards premium iPhones, which partially offsets the negative news. The overall smartphone market is recovering, and Apple's revenue is still expected to be heavily reliant on iPhones, with projections of 89%-96% of fiscal 2025 revenue coming from iPhones. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's growth in non-core markets, the consumer pivot to premium offerings, and the overall recovery of the global smartphone market are positive factors. Considering the mixed signals and the current slight decrease in stock price, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than that of it rising. The predictions from other models also suggest a similar trend, with a range of probabilities for a stock price fall between 0.58 and 0.7, and for a rise between 0.3 and 0.42. Taking into account the overall analysis and the trend of others' beliefs, the estimated probabilities are set to 0.4 for a rise and 0.6 for a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, where local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have gained momentum. While this is a concerning factor, Apple continues to show growth in non-core markets and benefits from a shift towards premium offerings. The overall smartphone market is also recovering, which could positively influence Apple's performance. The mix of positive and negative indicators results in a relatively balanced outlook, but given the significance of the Chinese market and the current trend of declining market share, the probability leans slightly towards a potential stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market for the company, which raises concerns about investor sentiment. Although Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets and a shift towards premium offerings may help offset some of the declines, the overall trend of losing market share to competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi is significant. The slight decrease in market share from 19% to 18% suggests a potential ongoing trend that may worry investors. Additionally, the current stock price is already down 0.54%, indicating a negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, but the mixed signals from growth in other markets and premium offerings suggest a moderate outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across previous rounds, stemming from Apple's declining iPhone market share in China and the rise of Huawei and Xiaomi, remains a significant concern. While there are mitigating factors like growth in non-core markets and a shift towards premium offerings, the Chinese market is crucial for Apple. The stock is already down slightly, reflecting this concern. The previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. Therefore, I will maintain a similar outlook, slightly increasing the probability of a fall due to the continued relevance of the initial negative news and the lack of significant positive catalysts in the provided information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, impacting a major market for Apple. The rise of competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi further exacerbates this concern.  However, several mitigating factors exist: growth in other markets, a shift towards higher-margin Pro models, the overall recovery of the global smartphone market, and projections of iPhones accounting for a large percentage of Apple's 2025 revenue.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.  Considering the mixed signals, the already negative market reaction (stock down 0.54%), and the weight of the Chinese market decline, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall.  The consensus from multiple AI models reinforces this assessment, with most predicting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.  However, Apple's overall strength and premium positioning suggest some resilience, preventing an extremely pessimistic outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market, which is a significant negative factor.

Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
