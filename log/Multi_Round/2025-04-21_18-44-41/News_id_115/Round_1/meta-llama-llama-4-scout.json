(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

The projected revenue growth is modest, and the stock has underperformed the market recently. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests potential underperformance, which may lead to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, there's a downward revision in EPS estimates over the past 30 days, which is a negative signal. The iPhone revenue is expected to decline slightly, which is a key concern given its importance to Apple's overall performance. Services revenue is expected to grow strongly, which is a positive. Geographic revenue is also mixed, with growth in Greater China and Europe, but declines in Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in the past month and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating further underperformance is expected. Considering these factors, the negative signals outweigh the positive ones, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors point towards a potential price decline.  The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates. The recent -12.8% share return also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The key points include a 1.1% downward revision in EPS estimates over the past 30 days, mixed performance across product and service segments, and a recent underperformance of AAPL's stock (-12.8% over the past month) compared to the S&P 500 (+1.1%). The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests potential underperformance in the near future. While some metrics like Services and Mac show growth, the decline in iPhone revenue and lower EPS revision create uncertainty. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to downward revisions and underperformance, but the mixed metrics prevent an extreme bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price movement. On the one hand, the company is expected to report an increase in quarterly earnings and revenues, with EPS estimated to rise by 8.3% and revenues by 3.7% year over year. Additionally, certain key metrics such as Net Sales- Services, Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories, and Geographic Revenue- Greater China are expected to show positive growth. On the other hand, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and its EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, indicating a potential negative reaction from investors. The company's stock price has also underperformed the market over the past month, with a return of -12.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1%. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems to be lower than that of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article provides an analysis of Apple's Q1 outlook, with Wall Street estimates indicating an 8.3% increase in quarterly earnings and a 3.7% increase in revenues. However, the consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, which may negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the stock has returned -12.8% over the past month, and Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near future. Despite some positive estimates, such as a 13.2% increase in 'Net Sales- Services' and a 6.5% increase in 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China', the overall outlook seems cautious. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates positive expectations for Apple's Q1 earnings with projected increases in both earnings per share and revenue. However, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days. Additionally, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggesting it may underperform the overall market. Shares of Apple have performed poorly over the past month, returning -12.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.
