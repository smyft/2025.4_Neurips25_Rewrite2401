(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Despite a general strong performance of Apple, concerns about reduced iPhone sales and overall market valuation are present. Analysts maintain a Buy rating, suggesting resilience in Apple's financials even amidst expected declines in unit sales. However, macroeconomic challenges and competitive AI stocks may temper some bullish sentiment. Overall, the positive stance from analysts and Buffett's longstanding investment suggest a higher probability of stock price increase despite some bearish indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Warren Buffett's long-held position in Apple, which is generally viewed favorably by other investors. It describes Apple's strong performance in Q4 2024, driven by product sales, and notes that BofA analysts reiterate a \"Buy\" rating, citing resilience, tailwinds, and cash flow. On the other hand, the article also mentions some negative headwinds, including Warren Buffett's overall shifted 'defensive' stance and significant cash hoard, as well as BofA analysts also predicting lower iPhone sales in the March quarter due to macroeconomic challenges and the delayed adoption for AI services. Additionally, Greenlight Capital's concerns about market valuation and their preference for other AI stocks further temper the outlook on Apple. Considering those factors, the analysis leans towards a slightly positive, yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position within Warren Buffett's portfolio and its long-term holding by Berkshire Hathaway. While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential downward pressure on Apple's stock price.  Conversely, the article also mentions BofA's continued 'Buy' rating for AAPL, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, which provides support for a stock price rise. The fact that Apple is listed as only the 9th longest-held stock by Buffett also implies a lower level of conviction compared to other holdings. Overall, the article presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price, with the negative factors possibly having a slightly stronger influence in the short-term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Warren Buffett's long-term holding of AAPL, which signals confidence in the company's fundamentals. 2) BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. 3) Apple's reported revenue growth and strong cash flow in Q4 2024. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic challenges and delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features, which could dampen growth. Overall, the positive aspects (Buffett's holding, strong financials, Buy rating) outweigh the negatives (lowered sales projections, macroeconomic challenges), suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 2025 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA maintains a Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. The overall sentiment of the article is neutral to positive, as it emphasizes Apple's strong position and financial health. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Buffett has a significant stake in Apple, the article also mentions that BofA analysts predict a lower March quarter guidance due to fewer iPhone shipments. However, the firm still reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Additionally, Apple's revenue and operating cash flow have increased, which could positively impact the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential.
