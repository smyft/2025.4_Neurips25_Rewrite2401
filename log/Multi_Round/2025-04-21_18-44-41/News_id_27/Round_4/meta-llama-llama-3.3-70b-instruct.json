(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and highlights his significant stake in Apple Inc., indicating a level of confidence in the company's potential. Despite a general strong performance of Apple, concerns about reduced iPhone sales and overall market valuation are present. Analysts maintain a Buy rating, suggesting resilience in Apple's financials even amidst expected declines in unit sales. However, macroeconomic challenges and competitive AI stocks may temper some bullish sentiment. Overall, the positive stance from analysts and Buffett's longstanding investment suggest a higher probability of stock price increase despite some bearish indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Warren Buffett's long-held position in Apple, which is generally viewed favorably by other investors. It describes Apple's strong performance in Q4 2024, driven by product sales, and notes that BofA analysts reiterate a \"Buy\" rating, citing resilience, tailwinds, and cash flow. On the other hand, the article also mentions some negative headwinds, including Warren Buffett's overall shifted 'defensive' stance and significant cash hoard, as well as BofA analysts also predicting lower iPhone sales in the March quarter due to macroeconomic challenges and the delayed adoption for AI services. Additionally, Greenlight Capital's concerns about market valuation and their preference for other AI stocks further temper the outlook on Apple. Considering those factors, the analysis leans towards a slightly positive, yet cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position within Warren Buffett's portfolio and its long-term holding by Berkshire Hathaway. While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential downward pressure on Apple's stock price.  Conversely, the article also mentions BofA's continued 'Buy' rating for AAPL, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, which provides support for a stock price rise. The fact that Apple is listed as only the 9th longest-held stock by Buffett also implies a lower level of conviction compared to other holdings. Overall, the article presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price, with the negative factors possibly having a slightly stronger influence in the short-term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Warren Buffett's long-term holding of AAPL, which signals confidence in the company's fundamentals. 2) BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. 3) Apple's reported revenue growth and strong cash flow in Q4 2024. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic challenges and delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features, which could dampen growth. Overall, the positive aspects (Buffett's holding, strong financials, Buy rating) outweigh the negatives (lowered sales projections, macroeconomic challenges), suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 2025 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA maintains a Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. The overall sentiment of the article is neutral to positive, as it emphasizes Apple's strong position and financial health. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Buffett has a significant stake in Apple, the article also mentions that BofA analysts predict a lower March quarter guidance due to fewer iPhone shipments. However, the firm still reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Additionally, Apple's revenue and operating cash flow have increased, which could positively impact the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a nuanced view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) in relation to Warren Buffett's investment strategies. While Buffett's long-term holding and substantial stake in Apple suggest confidence in the company's fundamentals, analysts' lowered expectations for iPhone sales and macroeconomic challenges introduce caution. The mixed signals from various analysts, with several maintaining a Buy rating despite projected decreases in unit sales, indicate that while there are positive indicators like revenue growth and resilient margins, concerns over future sales may weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the balance of confidence due to Buffett's involvement and Apple's financial health leads to a higher probability of stock price rise, but the caution from analysts and potential headwinds tempers that optimism slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While highlighting Warren Buffett's long-term confidence and significant stake in the company, it also notes concerns about potential decreases in future iPhone sales and general market valuation. BofA maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong financials, but lowered projections suggest some headwinds. The previous round of models shows a mixed consensus, with most leaning slightly towards a rise in stock price. Given these factors and the trend of beliefs in the previous rounds, a mildly positive probability of stock price rise is anticipated, but the chance of a fall remains substantial due to the potential negative catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Warren Buffett's continued significant investment in Apple is bullish, the lowered iPhone sales projections by BofA, coupled with Greenlight Capital's concerns about overall market valuation and preference for AI stocks, introduce bearish sentiment.  The fact that Apple is only the 9th longest-held stock by Buffett also suggests it's not his highest conviction holding.  BofA's maintained 'Buy' rating and Apple's strong Q4 results offer counterbalance, suggesting underlying strength and margin resilience.  Considering the blend of positive and negative factors and the previous predictions which range from 0.45 to 0.65 for a price rise, a probability around the mean seems reasonable. I've slightly weighted it towards a rise due to Buffett's continued holding despite his generally cautious stance. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Warren Buffett's long-term holding of AAPL, valued at $69.9 billion, signals strong confidence in the company's fundamentals. Apple's Q4 2024 financials show a 6% revenue increase and strong cash flow, with BofA maintaining a Buy rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections, citing margin resiliency and cash flow strength. However, concerns include BofA's reduced iPhone sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026, macroeconomic challenges, and delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Additionally, Greenlight Capital's cautious stance on market valuation and preference for other AI stocks adds a bearish note. Overall, the positive factors (Buffett's confidence, strong financials, Buy rating) slightly outweigh the negatives (lowered sales projections, macroeconomic headwinds), suggesting a marginally higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, Warren Buffett's long-term holding of AAPL and BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections suggest confidence in the company's fundamentals. Additionally, Apple's reported revenue growth and strong cash flow in Q4 2024 are positive indicators. However, concerns about macroeconomic challenges, delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features, and potentially high market valuation temper the outlook. Considering the trends in previous rounds' predictions, which showed a range of opinions from a slightly positive to a slightly negative outlook, and weighing the factors presented, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including its significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio and his long-term commitment, which often signifies confidence in the company's future. Despite this positive signal, there are concerns regarding potential macroeconomic challenges and lower iPhone shipment projections, which could negatively impact stock price. Several analyses indicate mixed sentiments with slight inclinations towards bullishness due to strong financials and resilience.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.41, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant and long-term investment in Apple Inc., which generally instills confidence among investors. Despite this positive signal, there are concerns about expected declines in iPhone shipments and general market valuation pressures, which could weigh on investor sentiment. Analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating, citing strong cash flow and resilience in margins, yet point to macroeconomic challenges impacting future sales. The consensus among previous predictions leans towards a slightly positive outlook, with some fluctuations in the probabilities but overall confidence in Apple's financial health counterbalancing the bearish sentiments. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising while acknowledging some risk for a potential decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Buffett's long-term holding is a strong positive signal, indicating confidence in the company's fundamentals. Apple's Q4 results and BofA's continued 'Buy' rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections reinforce this positive sentiment, highlighting the company's resilience and strong cash flow. However, the lowered iPhone sales projections, macroeconomic challenges, delayed AI adoption, and Greenlight's concerns about market valuation introduce bearish factors. Previous rounds of predictions reflect this uncertainty, hovering around a slightly positive outlook. Considering these factors and the trend of beliefs, the probability of a rise is slightly favored, but the potential for a fall is considerable due to the existing headwinds and market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Buffett's continued significant investment is a strong positive signal, indicating long-term confidence in the company's fundamentals. Apple's Q4 2024 results, showing revenue growth and strong cash flow, further reinforce this positive sentiment.  However, several factors suggest caution. BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, driven by macroeconomic headwinds and slower-than-expected AI feature adoption, introduce a significant bearish counterpoint.  The fact that Apple is only the 9th longest-held stock in Buffett's portfolio also suggests it's not his highest-conviction holding, tempering the bullish impact of his investment.  The overall sentiment expressed by analysts is cautiously optimistic, with 'Buy' ratings maintained despite lowered sales expectations. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, which mostly clustered around a 0.55-0.6 probability of a price rise, and weighing the mixed signals from the news, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than that of a price fall, leaning towards the positive information from Buffett's investment and strong financials while acknowledging the significant downward pressure from lowered sales forecasts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, Warren Buffett's long-term holding of AAPL, valued at $69.9 billion, signals strong confidence in the company's fundamentals. Apple's Q4 2024 financials show a 6% revenue increase and strong cash flow, with BofA maintaining a Buy rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections, citing margin resiliency and cash flow strength. However, concerns include BofA's reduced iPhone sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026, macroeconomic challenges, and delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Additionally, Greenlight Capital's cautious stance on market valuation and preference for other AI stocks adds a bearish note. Overall, the positive factors (Buffett's confidence, strong financials, Buy rating) slightly outweigh the negatives (lowered sales projections, macroeconomic headwinds), suggesting a marginally higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's long-term holding of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and highlights both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, Buffett's significant stake and BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections suggest confidence in Apple's fundamentals. Additionally, Apple's reported revenue growth and strong cash flow in Q4 2024 are positive indicators. However, concerns about macroeconomic challenges, delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features, and potentially high market valuation temper the outlook. Considering the trends in previous rounds' predictions, which showed a range of opinions from a slightly positive to a slightly negative outlook, and weighing the factors presented, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price.

Despite this positive signal, there are concerns regarding potential macroeconomic challenges, lower iPhone shipment projections, and market valuation tempered by other AI stocks. Previous predictions show a moderate but cautious optimism, reflecting a balanced view with slight inclinations toward bullishness due to strong financials and historical investments. Combining these, the overall assessment indicates a slightly higher probability of stock price stability with positive and negative factors offsetting each other moderately.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The analysis of the recent news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) suggests a mixed outlook influenced by both bullish and bearish factors. Warren Buffett's long-term investment and significant stake in Apple indicate confidence in the company's fundamentals, which is a positive signal for investors. Analysts from BofA maintain a 'Buy' rating based on strong cash flow and margin resiliency, despite a decrease in expected iPhone sales due to macroeconomic challenges and competition from AI stocks. The previous rounds of predictions largely lean towards a slightly positive view, weighing the historical confidence from Buffett against the concerns raised regarding future sales. Overall, the slight edge in sentiment and analyst confidence supports a higher probability of stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Buffett's continued holding is a positive signal. Apple's strong Q4 results and BofA's continued 'Buy' despite lowered iPhone sales emphasize resilience. However, lower iPhone sales projections, macroeconomic challenges, AI adoption delays, and market valuation concerns introduce bearish factors. Previous predictions hovered around slightly positive outlooks. Given these factors and belief trends, I will assign a close probability to the rise and fall, reflecting the mixed signals and continuing uncertainty. Although some signs may point out a slightly positive increase, the probabilities would more reasonably reflect the current signals in the news, which are far more mixed, as well as the trend in prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The strong positive is Warren Buffett's continued significant investment, signaling long-term confidence. Apple's Q4 results, showing revenue growth and strong cash flow, further support this. However, several bearish factors exist: BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, macroeconomic headwinds, slower-than-expected AI feature adoption, and Greenlight Capital's concerns about market valuation.  The fact that Apple is only the 9th longest-held stock in Buffett's portfolio also tempers the bullish impact. The previous rounds of predictions show a clustering around 0.55-0.6 probability for a price rise, reflecting this uncertainty.  Considering all factors, including the trend of previous model predictions, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but the potential for a fall remains substantial.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with positive factors including Warren Buffett's long-term holding and significant stake, strong Q4 2024 financials, and BofA's maintained 'Buy' rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections. Negative factors include concerns about macroeconomic challenges, delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features, and potentially high market valuation. The previous rounds of predictions showed a range of opinions from slightly positive to slightly negative, with most models leaning towards a slightly higher probability of stock price rise.
