      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\nNews Content: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by TSMC in expanding its Arizona facility, which is crucial for Apple's supply chain. Delays in chip production could impact Apple's ability to meet demand for its products, potentially leading to a negative sentiment among investors. However, TSMC reassured investors about the quality of the Arizona facility, which may mitigate some concerns. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding supply chain issues and production delays suggests a higher probability of stock price decline for Apple, as it relies heavily on TSMC for its chips.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates potential setbacks for TSMC's Arizona plant due to regulatory hurdles, construction delays, and labor shortages. While TSMC assures quality parity with Taiwan, the delays and prioritization of Taiwan for advanced chip technology could negatively impact Apple, a major TSMC customer. This is because it could delay or limit the supply of advanced chips needed for Apple's products, potentially affecting production timelines and future product performance. The GuruFocus warning signs for TSM further contribute to the negative sentiment. Therefore, there's a higher probability of a stock price fall for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on TSMC's challenges in expanding its Arizona plant, citing regulatory hurdles and labor shortages.  While TSMC produces chips for Apple, the news is indirect and doesn't directly impact Apple's financials or operations. The delays in TSMC's Arizona plant might lead to some minor supply chain concerns in the long term, but the impact on Apple is likely to be minimal, especially considering TSMC's reassurance about the Arizona facility's quality and its commitment to prioritizing Taiwan for its most advanced technology.  The 5 warning signs for TSM detected by GuruFocus are also not directly related to Apple. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant price movement for Apple stock in either direction.  A slight negative impact is possible due to indirect supply chain concerns, but this is likely to be outweighed by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights delays in TSMC's Arizona plant due to U.S. permitting and labor shortages, which could impact the supply chain for Apple's chips. However, TSMC's CEO reassured investors about matching Taiwan's quality, which may mitigate some concerns. Apple, as a major customer of TSMC, might face potential supply chain disruptions, but the reassurance could balance the impact. Overall, the news is mildly negative for Apple due to potential supply chain risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by TSMC, a major supplier of chips to Apple Inc. (AAPL), in setting up its Arizona plant due to regulatory and labor issues. Despite these challenges, TSMC reassures that the Arizona facility will match the quality of its Taiwan operations. However, the delays and issues at TSMC could potentially impact Apple's supply chain, particularly if TSMC prioritizes its Taiwanese operations for advanced chip technology. Given that Apple relies on TSMC for its chips, any significant delay or prioritization could negatively affect Apple's production and, consequently, its stock price. However, the impact might be limited as the article does not indicate a complete halt or significant downgrade in TSMC's operations or its commitment to Apple. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower, while the probability of it falling is higher, but not extremely so, given the resilience of Apple's supply chain and business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in setting up its Arizona plant, including slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages. As TSMC is a key supplier of chips to Apple, any delays or issues in their production can potentially impact Apple's operations. However, the article also mentions that TSMC's Arizona facility has matched Taiwan's quality, which is a positive sign. Considering these factors, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, as the delays and challenges faced by TSMC may lead to concerns about Apple's supply chain and production capabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on TSMC's challenges in expanding its manufacturing facilities in Arizona due to regulatory hurdles and labor shortages. While TSMC is a key supplier for Apple, the issues highlighted do not directly affect Apple\u2019s operations or financials. However, delays in TSMC\u2019s production could potentially impact Apple\u2019s supply chain in the future, leading to some concerns. Given that the news primarily impacts TSMC rather than Apple directly, and that TSMC has reassured investors regarding the quality of their Arizona facility, the immediate effect on Apple's stock might be minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
