(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price.

While the Nasdaq futures are pointing higher, suggesting a potential recovery from the recent sell-off, the overall market sentiment remains cautious due to fears of reduced AI spending. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report may influence stock movement, but the immediate impact of the news surrounding DeepSeek could lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall as investors digest the implications of increased competition in the AI space.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the overall market sentiment is recovering slightly after a tech sell-off triggered by concerns about DeepSeek's AI model. Nasdaq futures are up, suggesting a potential rebound. However, DeepSeek's model directly competes with AI offerings from companies like Apple, and its success on the App Store (overtaking ChatGPT in downloads) is a negative signal. Sam Altman's comments acknowledge DeepSeek's impressiveness, which adds credibility to the threat. Furthermore, the article highlights that investors are keen to see how mega-cap tech companies justify their AI spending, placing Apple under scrutiny. The upcoming earnings report is a major catalyst, and the market's reaction to Apple's AI strategy will be crucial. Given the competitive pressure from DeepSeek and the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI spending, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily invested in AI, Apple's direct exposure to this specific threat is limited.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related hardware and software companies, and while Apple is involved in AI, it's not as directly exposed as Nvidia or companies heavily reliant on high-performance computing for AI development.  The fact that DeepSeek's app topped Apple's App Store could be viewed as either positive (demonstrating the App Store's reach and potential for AI app adoption) or negative (highlighting a potential competitor in the AI space).  However, Sam Altman's comments suggest that the long-term demand for AI and high-performance computing remains strong, which could ultimately benefit Apple in the long run.  The overall market reaction is uncertain, with Nasdaq futures inching up after a significant sell-off.  Given the mixed signals and Apple's relatively less direct exposure compared to other tech giants mentioned, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered relatively balanced, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the general market uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the broader tech sell-off due to concerns over DeepSeek's low-cost AI model could negatively affect AAPL, as it is part of the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies. The sell-off in AI-adjacent stocks and the overall market sentiment might weigh on AAPL's stock price. On the other hand, DeepSeek's AI model becoming the best-selling app on Apple's App Store could be seen as a positive for AAPL, indicating strong demand for AI applications on its platform. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report could provide clarity and potentially positive surprises. Given these factors, the probability of a rise or fall is balanced but slightly skewed towards a negative short-term impact due to the broader market sell-off.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI model and its impact on Big Tech spending plans led to a sell-off in technology stocks, particularly affecting companies like Nvidia and Apple. However, Nvidia's stock price rose in after-hours trading, indicating a potential recovery. Apple's stock price movement is also influenced by the mention of its App Store and the performance of DeepSeek's model. Given that the Nasdaq futures are up after the sell-off and Nvidia rises after-hours, it suggests a possible rebound in tech stocks. However, the emergence of DeepSeek as a low-cost competitor in AI models could potentially dent Apple's AI-related spending plans and consequently its stock price. But, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaking positively about AI models and the need for more computing power, it indicates a continued demand for AI technology, which could benefit Apple in the long run.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on the tech industry, particularly on companies like Nvidia and Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek's model has sparked concerns about the spending plans of Big Tech companies on AI. However, OpenAI's CEO has stated that DeepSeek's model is impressive but that more computing power is still important for AI research. The article also mentions that Apple is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Thursday. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to the news. Since the news has already caused a sell-off in tech stocks, including Apple, and the company's earnings report is upcoming, the market may be cautious. Nevertheless, the fact that DeepSeek's model is seen as impressive and that OpenAI plans to deliver better models suggests that the AI industry is still growing, which could positively impact Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off in tech stocks due to concerns over a Chinese AI model, which led to significant drops in stocks like Nvidia. Although Apple is mentioned, it is in the context of their App Store being used to download the AI model. The overall sentiment is negative towards tech stocks due to the implications on future AI spending. However, Apple remains a robust player in the market unaffected by these specific AI concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
