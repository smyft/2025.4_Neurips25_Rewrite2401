A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive market sentiment following President Trump's return to office, which has historically correlated with bullish trends in the stock market. The mention of a strong start to the presidential term and comparisons to successful tech stocks (FANG and Magnificent Seven) suggest a favorable environment for major tech companies like Apple. Given the overall positive market context and the focus on tech stocks, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive market sentiment due to the strong start of President Trump's term. The analysis compares FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, which includes Apple (AAPL). A rising tide lifts all boats, and a strong market performance generally benefits large-cap tech companies like Apple. The mention of Bitcoin and Gold approaching record highs could indicate a risk-on environment, which could also benefit tech stocks. However, the news is not directly about Apple, and the impact is more general market sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge driven by President Trump's return to office, noting the best start to a presidential term since 1985.  It mentions a comparison between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, but doesn't provide specific information about Apple's performance or outlook.  While a general market upswing is positive, the lack of Apple-specific information makes it difficult to definitively predict its stock movement based solely on this news.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the general market positivity and the inherent volatility of the stock market, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline mentions a surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office, which historically has been a positive indicator for the market. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Magnificent Seven stocks, which are likely to benefit from overall market optimism. The comparison between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks suggests a focus on large tech companies, which could lead to increased investor interest in AAPL. The mention of bitcoin and gold approaching record highs indicates a risk-on sentiment, which is generally favorable for tech stocks like AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall market performance during President Trump's first week back in office, with US equity markets surging and marking the best start to a presidential term since 1985. Although the article does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it does compare FANG stocks (which include Apple) to the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. The article also mentions the performance of other markets and assets, such as bitcoin and gold. Given the positive market sentiment and the fact that Apple is a component of the FANG stocks, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise. However, the article does not provide any company-specific news that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively close due to the lack of company-specific news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news describes a surge in US equity markets following President Trump's return to office, which includes positive mentions of FANG stocks (which would include Apple). The overall market positivity, combined with the mention of strong performance of both equities and tech stocks, suggests a likely positive sentiment towards Apple's stock. However, it is important to note that specific company performance can be influenced by a multitude of factors beyond general market trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant surge in US equity markets following President Trump's return to office, which historically correlates with positive market sentiment. The mention of a strong start to a presidential term and comparisons to successful tech stocks (FANG and Magnificent Seven) suggest a favorable environment for major tech companies like Apple. While the news does not provide specific information about Apple's performance, the overall positive market context and the focus on tech stocks indicate a higher likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of an increase in stock price compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive market sentiment driven by President Trump's return, with comparisons to the successful Reagan era. The article mentions FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, which include Apple, suggesting a favorable environment for major tech companies. Previous models also leaned towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of a rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Considering this positive momentum and the general market optimism, I will slightly increase the probability of a rise, while acknowledging that the news isn't directly Apple-specific and market conditions can change rapidly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news reports a broad market surge driven by positive sentiment surrounding President Trump's return.  While the article doesn't contain Apple-specific information, it favorably mentions tech stocks in general, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven companies. Apple is included in both groups.  The overall positive market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of AAPL rising, but the lack of company-specific news prevents a strong prediction.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, and acknowledging the inherent volatility of the stock market, a conservative estimate is warranted.  The previous models' reasoning is largely consistent with this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, with comparisons to the best start to a presidential term since 1985. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which are likely to benefit from this overall market optimism. The positive sentiment around tech stocks and the risk-on environment indicated by bitcoin and gold approaching record highs further support a bullish outlook for AAPL. While the news does not provide specific details about Apple, the general market positivity and historical trends suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. Previous predictions also lean towards a rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Considering these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights a positive market sentiment with US equity markets surging during President Trump's first week back in office. This surge includes a comparison between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, which suggests a favorable environment for large tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL). The overall market positivity, combined with the focus on tech stocks, indicates a likely positive sentiment towards Apple's stock. However, the lack of company-specific news about Apple and the general nature of the market surge make the probabilities relatively close, but with a slight bias towards a rise due to the positive market context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge driven by President Trump's return to office, noting the best start to a presidential term since 1985. It mentions a comparison between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, which includes Apple. A general market upswing is positive, and the lack of Apple-specific negative information makes it difficult to definitively predict its stock movement based solely on this news. However, considering the overall positive market sentiment and the inherent volatility of the stock market, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the overall positive market sentiment, and taking into account the predictions from other models which suggest a range of probabilities with a general leaning towards a rise, a balanced estimate is appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office, marking one of the best starts to a presidential term. The article mentions both FANG stocks and the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple. The overall positive market sentiment and the focus on strong tech stock performance suggest a favorable environment for Apple. Although the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, the general bullish market conditions and the association with leading tech stocks indicate a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant surge in US equity markets following President Trump's return to office, which historically correlates with positive market sentiment.

Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of an increase in stock price compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The consistent positive sentiment across previous predictions, coupled with the news highlighting a strong market surge and favorable comparisons to FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks (which include Apple), suggests a continued bullish outlook. While the news lacks Apple-specific details, the overall market positivity and tech-focused narrative support a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of a rise, which I will also reflect in my prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news reports a broad market surge driven by positive sentiment surrounding President Trump's return to office.  This positive market sentiment is the primary driver of the prediction. While the news doesn't contain Apple-specific information, it favorably mentions tech stocks in general, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven companies, both of which include Apple.  The overall positive market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of AAPL rising. However, the lack of company-specific news and the inherent volatility of the stock market prevent a strong prediction.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.78 for a price rise, and acknowledging the general upward trend shown in the previous rounds, a conservative estimate is warranted, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the overall positive market context.  The consensus among previous models, showing a gradual increase in the probability of a price rise across rounds, further supports this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office, with comparisons to the best start to a presidential term since 1985. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks mentioned in the article, which suggests a favorable environment for major tech companies. The overall positive market sentiment, coupled with the focus on tech stocks, indicates a likely positive impact on Apple's stock price. While the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, the general bullish market conditions and the association with leading tech stocks support a higher probability of the stock price rising. Previous predictions also leaned towards a rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.78, further reinforcing this outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive market sentiment following President Trump's return to office, with US equity markets surging and marking the best start to a presidential term since 1985.
