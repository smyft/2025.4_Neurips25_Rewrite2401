A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the absence of Nvidia's CEO at Trump's inauguration and does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). While it highlights the dynamics between Big Tech and the incoming administration, it does not provide any specific information or events that would impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of significant movement in AAPL's stock price are low, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan. While the article mentions other Big Tech CEOs attending, the primary focus is on Nvidia. The news is largely neutral for Apple (AAPL). There's no direct impact or mention of Apple's business, operations, or competitive landscape. The tangential connection to the broader tech industry's relationship with the Trump administration is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to equal, reflecting the lack of direct impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is not directly relevant to Apple (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there's no information connecting Apple's performance or stock price to this event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific news is extremely low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang not attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide any information that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of various Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, specifically mentioning that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. or provide any information that could directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this news has no direct effect on Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news article does not directly mention or relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather discusses the attendance of various Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, focusing on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence. Since the news does not contain any information about Apple Inc. or its operations, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be low and nearly equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance to Apple Inc.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
