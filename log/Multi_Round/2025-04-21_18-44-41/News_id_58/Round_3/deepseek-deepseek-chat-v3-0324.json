(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news from Jim Cramer indicates a highly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with expectations of disappointing earnings driven by poor sales in China, lackluster performance in new AI initiatives, and a significant reduction in forecasts. Cramer's warning about the earnings season and the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's decisions adds to the bearish sentiment. Although he acknowledges Apple's strong management and historical resilience, the immediate sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, suggesting a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he also advises investors to hold the stock, citing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical performance. He believes Apple controls its own future. However, the article also suggests that AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone leans slightly negative in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment, but positive in the long term due to Apple's fundamentals. Given the conflicting signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report, but not overwhelmingly so, as Cramer's advice to hold could mitigate the negative impact. The long-term outlook remains positive, but this analysis focuses on the immediate reaction to the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, predicts a significant disappointment in Apple's upcoming earnings report.  He anticipates negative news regarding Chinese sales, AI integration, service revenue, Vision Pro sales, and a lowered forecast.  While he advises against short-term trading and recommends holding the stock long-term due to Apple's strong management and product quality, his overwhelmingly negative prediction for the earnings report strongly suggests a potential near-term price drop.  The article also highlights that Cramer's focus has shifted towards AI stocks, implying a relative lack of confidence in Apple's immediate prospects compared to other sectors.  However, the fact that he still recommends holding the stock long-term suggests the negative impact might be temporary and not catastrophic.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is assigned a higher value than a price rise, but not an extreme value, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in market reactions and Cramer's own mixed message.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions the stock as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment' he's ever seen. He highlights potential issues such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI impact, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The mixed sentiment, with negative short-term outlook but positive long-term perspective, suggests uncertainty in immediate stock price movement. The Federal Reserve's upcoming decision and broader market conditions add to the complexity.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about Apple Inc. (AAPL) describes it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen,' suggesting that the stock's earnings report is expected to be negative. However, Cramer also advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, citing Apple's exceptional management and product quality. This mixed message may lead to a cautious market response. Given the anticipation of a disappointment, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising, but Cramer's advice to hold suggests that the downside might be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he expresses caution and warns of potential disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and high-quality products. He notes that historically, it has been more beneficial to hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it. Considering Cramer's advice and the overall context, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment but remains a strong hold for long-term investors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news from Jim Cramer presents a highly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting anticipated disappointments in earnings due to poor sales in China, lack of AI impact, and a significant reduction in forecasts. Cramer's warning about the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's decisions further adds to the bearish sentiment. While he acknowledges Apple's strong management and historical resilience, the immediate sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, suggesting a higher probability of stock price decline in the short term. The previous predictions from various models also reflect a consensus leaning towards a price fall, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 for a decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from the previous rounds leans towards a negative short-term outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to Jim Cramer's anticipation of disappointing earnings. While Cramer advises holding the stock long-term, the immediate reaction to the news is expected to be negative. The probabilities assigned in previous rounds reflect this sentiment, with most models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Considering the consistent negative sentiment and the lack of any new positive information, I will maintain a similar outlook, slightly adjusting the probabilities based on the trend of previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jim Cramer predicts a significant near-term disappointment in Apple's earnings, citing various factors like weak Chinese sales and lackluster Vision Pro sales.  However, he simultaneously advises *holding* the stock due to Apple's strong management and product quality, suggesting a belief in its long-term prospects.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.  While the negative sentiment is strong, Cramer's recommendation to hold mitigates the extreme bearishness.  Considering the anticipated disappointment and the overall negative sentiment, a price fall is more likely in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, as indicated by Cramer's advice to hold.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall in the short term, but not as high as the most pessimistic predictions, acknowledging the potential for a limited downside due to Cramer's recommendation and Apple's strong fundamentals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

He advises investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, emphasizing Apple's exceptional management and long-term potential.

The mixed message from Cramer, warning of short-term issues but advising a long-term hold, suggests a cautious approach. Given the anticipation of a disappointment and the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's decisions, the probability of a stock price decline seems higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc.
