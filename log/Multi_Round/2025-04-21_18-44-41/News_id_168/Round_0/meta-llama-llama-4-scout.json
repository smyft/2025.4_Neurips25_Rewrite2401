This development may negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability, as Epic Games' marketplace may attract users away from Apple's ecosystem. However, it's worth noting that Apple's vast ecosystem and loyal customer base may mitigate the impact. The news is more related to Google (Alphabet) as Epic is taking on Google and Apple, but still, it might have a slight negative impact on Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```\n\nIn this analysis, I have estimated that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is 30% (0.3), while the probability of the stock price falling is 70% (0.7). The reasoning behind this prediction is that the introduction of Epic Games' app marketplace with third-party games may pose a threat to Apple's App Store business model, potentially leading to a decline in the stock price. However, the impact may be limited, and Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected in the short term."
