While Apple is mentioned, the news describes Epic Games' actions against Google and Apple, suggesting competition in the app marketplace.  This is potentially negative for Apple in the long term, as it could lead to reduced revenue from app store fees if third-party marketplaces gain traction. However, the impact is likely to be gradual and indirect.  The article is also incomplete, preventing a full assessment of the potential impact.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction due to this news alone is low.  A slight negative impact is possible, but the overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a much larger influence on Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```\n"
