(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\nNews Content: Epic Games is planning to introduce 19 third-party games to its mobile marketplace on Alphabet's (GO\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector where Apple has a significant presence through its App Store. This could lead to concerns about potential revenue loss for Apple if users prefer Epic's marketplace over Apple's. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by the company's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a risk of a negative impact, the extent may not be severe enough to cause a significant drop in stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Epic Games introducing third-party games on its marketplace, challenging Apple and Google's app store dominance, is a long-term strategic move. While it might not immediately impact Apple's revenue significantly, it signals increasing competition and potential erosion of Apple's control over its ecosystem. This could lead to investor concern about future revenue streams and market share. However, Apple is a large, diversified company, and this single event is unlikely to cause a major stock price drop. The impact on Google is also relevant, but the focus here is on Apple. The news is more likely to create a slight negative sentiment than a positive one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Epic Games, not Apple, as the primary focus.  While Apple is mentioned, the news describes Epic Games' actions against Google and Apple, suggesting competition in the app marketplace.  This is potentially negative for Apple in the long term, as it could lead to reduced revenue from app store fees if third-party marketplaces gain traction. However, the impact is likely to be gradual and indirect.  The article is also incomplete, preventing a full assessment of the potential impact.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction due to this news alone is low.  A slight negative impact is possible, but the overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a much larger influence on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's App Store dominance by introducing third-party games to its own marketplace. This could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from App Store commissions, which is a significant part of its services segment. However, the impact may be limited as Apple's ecosystem and user base remain strong. The market's reaction could be mixed, with some investors seeing this as a negative development for Apple's revenue stream, while others may view it as a minor challenge given Apple's overall market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Epic Games is planning to introduce third-party games on its own app marketplace, which could potentially challenge Apple's App Store dominance. This development may negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability, as Epic Games' marketplace may attract users away from Apple's ecosystem. However, it's worth noting that Apple's vast ecosystem and loyal customer base may mitigate the impact. The news is more related to Google (Alphabet) as Epic is taking on Google and Apple, but still, it might have a slight negative impact on Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The introduction of third-party games to Epic Games' mobile marketplace could potentially threaten Apple's App Store revenue, as it may encourage developers to distribute their games outside of the App Store, thereby reducing Apple's commission fees. This news may be perceived as a negative development for Apple, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price. However, the impact may be limited, as Apple's App Store is a well-established platform with a large user base, and the company has a diverse range of revenue streams.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Epic Games launching its own app marketplace with third-party games could be seen as a competitive move against Apple. This might lead to concerns over reduced commission fees for Apple, as Epic Games aims to bypass Apple's usual revenue share. However, this news might also trigger positive reactions from investors who appreciate increased competition as it can potentially drive innovation and better terms for developers. Therefore, the overall impact on the stock price could go either way, but historical trends suggest that such competitive moves often result in short-term volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its own app marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to concerns about reduced revenue from app store fees. Most analyses indicate a negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to this development, as it signals increasing competition and potential erosion of Apple's control over its ecosystem. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams may mitigate the impact. Given the consensus among previous predictions leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for a price decline and 0.35 for a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The previous rounds consistently lean towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to Epic Games' move. The reasoning centers around potential revenue loss for Apple's App Store as developers and users might shift to Epic's marketplace. While Apple's strong ecosystem and brand loyalty are acknowledged, the competitive threat is seen as a significant factor. The consensus seems to be a higher probability of a stock price fall. Considering this trend and the potential for increased competition, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more negative outlook, but not drastically, given Apple's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games' competing app marketplace presents a potential long-term threat to Apple's App Store revenue.  However, the impact is likely to be gradual and indirect.  Apple's vast ecosystem, diverse revenue streams, and strong brand loyalty mitigate the immediate risk of a significant stock price drop.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  While the threat is real, it's not an immediate existential crisis for Apple.  Considering the previous predictions and the overall context, a slight negative impact is more probable than a significant positive one, but the effect is likely to be small in the short term.  The incomplete nature of the news article further reduces the certainty of any significant price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace is seen as a competitive threat to Apple's App Store dominance. While this could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions, the impact is likely to be gradual and mitigated by Apple's strong ecosystem and diverse revenue streams. Previous predictions generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 0.6-0.7 probability of a fall and a 0.3-0.4 probability of a rise. Given the consensus and the nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the perceived competitive threat, though the impact may not be severe.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector where Apple has a significant presence through its App Store. This development may lead to concerns about potential revenue loss for Apple if users prefer Epic's marketplace over Apple's. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate the impact. The overall sentiment from previous predictions suggests a slightly negative impact, but not severe enough to cause a significant drop in stock price. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise, but with a moderate difference.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. However, considering the diverse product offerings and strong brand loyalty of Apple, the overall impact on the stock price may be mitigated. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there is a trend indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, likely due to concerns over potential revenue loss from App Store commissions. Taking into account the competitive move by Epic Games and the potential for increased competition in the app marketplace, the probabilities of stock price movement are estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential competitive threat from Epic Games launching its own app marketplace, which could reduce Apple's revenue from App Store commissions. However, Apple's strong market position, broad ecosystem, and loyal customer base may help mitigate the immediate impact. The news suggests long-term strategic challenges rather than immediate financial damage. Previous predictions show a consensus view leaning towards a slightly negative impact on stock price due to this news. Considering all these factors, the probability of a stock price rise remains relatively low, but not negligible.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to concerns about reduced revenue from app store fees.

While Apple's strengths are acknowledged, the competitive pressure is viewed as a significant factor. The trend shows a leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall. Given this consensus and the potential for increased competition, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more negative outlook, but not drastically, given Apple's overall strength. The incomplete nature of the news article also reduces the certainty of any significant price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a competing app marketplace presents a potential long-term competitive threat to Apple's App Store, potentially impacting revenue from app store fees.  However, Apple's vast ecosystem, diverse revenue streams, and strong brand loyalty significantly mitigate the risk of a substantial immediate stock price drop.  The previous predictions consistently show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 in the first round and slightly lower in the second.  This consensus reflects the potential for gradual revenue erosion rather than a sudden collapse.  While the threat is real, it's not an immediate existential crisis for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, the incomplete nature of the news article, and Apple's overall strength, a slight negative impact is more probable than a significant positive one in the short term.
