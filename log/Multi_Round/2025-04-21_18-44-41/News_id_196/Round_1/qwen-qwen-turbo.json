(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $1B Deal Poised to End Indonesia iPhone 16 Ban, Officials Say\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged higher Thursday after reports indicated the company is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani told Bloomberg in Davos that he expects a resolution within one to two weeks.\n\nThe government had previously rejected Apple's $1 billion investment plan, which included an AirTag factory, saying it did not meet local content requirements for smartphone production. Indonesia first imposed the ban in October 2024, citing Apple's failure to meet investment thresholds. The company initially offered $100 million over two years, later increasing the bid to $1 billion.\n\nReports last month suggested President Prabowo Subianto approved the latest proposal, paving the way for a deal. Roeslani said the government and Apple are now working through differences in how local content is calculated and expressed confidence that an agreement will soon allow iPhone 16 sales to resume in the Southeast Asian market.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant issue that has impacted its sales in Indonesia, a key market for the iPhone 16. The reported $1 billion investment plan, which has gained government approval, suggests a positive outlook for Apple's operations in the region. The resolution of the ban is likely to lead to increased sales and revenue, which typically drives stock prices higher. Given the positive sentiment and the potential for increased market access, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple. Resolving the dispute with Indonesia and resuming iPhone 16 sales in that market is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The $1 billion investment commitment, while a cost, signals Apple's commitment to the region and long-term growth. The fact that officials are expressing confidence in a resolution within weeks further strengthens the positive outlook. While the initial impact might be small, the removal of uncertainty and the potential for increased sales in Indonesia outweigh any negative aspects. The article also mentions that the stock 'edged higher' after the news, indicating an initial positive reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential resolution to a significant issue impacting Apple's sales in Indonesia.  The Indonesian government's ban on iPhone 16 sales due to unmet investment requirements was a considerable risk.  A $1 billion investment deal nearing completion suggests a positive outcome for Apple, potentially unlocking a substantial market. While the exact impact on Apple's overall revenue is uncertain, the removal of a sales ban in a growing market is generally viewed favorably by investors.  However, the market may have already partially priced in this positive outcome given previous reports suggesting the deal's approval. Therefore, while a price rise is likely, the magnitude might be less than if this news were entirely unexpected.  There's a small chance the deal could still fall through, leading to a minor price drop, although this seems less probable given the optimistic statements from Indonesian officials.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant dispute with Indonesia, which had previously blocked iPhone 16 sales due to local investment rules. The resolution of this dispute is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it removes a barrier to sales in a key Southeast Asian market and demonstrates Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges. The investment of $1 billion, including an AirTag factory, also signals Apple's commitment to expanding its presence in the region, which could lead to future growth. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has reportedly agreed to a $1 billion investment deal which includes meeting local content requirements and setting up an AirTag factory. This development is expected to positively impact Apple's stock price as it removes a significant overhang for the company in a key market. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher because the resolution of this dispute is likely to enhance investor confidence and potentially increase revenue from one of the company's significant markets.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. The resolution of this dispute is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it will allow the company to resume sales in the Indonesian market.
