      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok ban: Where will the app's revenue and 170M users go?\nNews Content: The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the app store, it could lead to a temporary disruption in user engagement and advertising revenue, which may negatively impact Apple's app ecosystem. However, the potential redirection of TikTok's users and advertisers to other platforms like Instagram and YouTube could mean that Apple may not see a significant long-term impact on its revenue. The uncertainty surrounding the legal risks and the potential for a significant user base shift creates a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of stock price decline due to immediate market reactions and uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential negative publicity if it removes TikTok from its app store, potentially impacting user sentiment and brand image. This could lead to a slight negative impact on the stock. On the other hand, the removal of TikTok could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing user engagement and app downloads for competing platforms available on the App Store, potentially driving revenue. However, this benefit is indirect and less certain. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. Given these factors, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be slightly negative or neutral in the short term. The negative sentiment associated with potential legal risks and the uncertainty surrounding the transition of users and ad revenue outweigh the potential indirect benefits.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and the subsequent impact on other tech companies, particularly Apple. While Apple might benefit indirectly from a shift in advertising revenue towards platforms like Google and Facebook (which could positively impact Apple's advertising business), the direct impact on Apple is less clear.  The removal of TikTok from the App Store could cause a short-term disruption and uncertainty, potentially impacting Apple's services revenue. However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small compared to Apple's massive overall revenue and market capitalization.  The analyst's comments focus more on the impact on Google and Facebook, suggesting a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is considered low.  A slight negative impact is possible due to the uncertainty and potential short-term disruption, but this is likely to be temporary.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US, which could redirect its 170 million users and significant advertising revenue to other platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube (GOOGL), and Snapchat (SNAP). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of removing TikTok from its App Store, the direct impact on Apple's revenue is less clear. Apple's App Store revenue could be marginally affected by the removal of TikTok, but the broader ecosystem impact is uncertain. The primary beneficiaries appear to be Meta and Google, not Apple. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US could have indirect implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company might need to remove TikTok from its app store. However, the primary beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are likely to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). Apple's core business is not directly impacted by TikTok's ban, but there might be a minor negative impact if TikTok's users and advertisers redirect their attention and spending to platforms that compete with Apple's services. Given the relatively minor connection between TikTok's ban and Apple's core business, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the overall market dynamics and competition. However, the impact is expected to be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its possible impact on other social media companies. As a result, companies like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) may gain traffic, while Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) may face legal risks due to the removal of TikTok from their app stores. However, the article does not directly imply a significant negative impact on Apple's overall business. In fact, the potential shift of advertisers from TikTok to other platforms like Google and Facebook could indirectly benefit Apple through its own advertising business or through the increased usage of its devices on other social media platforms. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary by a specific date. This scenario could lead to a shift in user base and advertising revenue for platforms currently competing with TikTok, such as Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). As a major player in the mobile app ecosystem, Apple (AAPL) could face a temporary limbo period if TikTok is removed from its app store. However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US presents a complex scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the removal of TikTok could lead to a temporary disruption in user engagement and advertising revenue, the long-term impact on Apple's core business remains uncertain. Analysts suggest that the primary beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban would be competing platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat, which could redirect user traffic and advertising dollars away from TikTok. This shift may create a short-term negative sentiment around Apple's stock due to legal risks and uncertainty. However, the overall impact on Apple's revenue is likely to be limited, as the company has a diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline due to immediate market reactions and uncertainty, but the potential for a slight rise exists if advertisers shift their spending to platforms that could indirectly benefit Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple might face some short-term disruption and negative publicity from removing TikTok from its app store, the overall impact on its stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The redirection of TikTok's users and advertising revenue to other platforms like Instagram and YouTube could indirectly benefit Apple through increased app usage and potential ad revenue. However, this benefit is less direct and certain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook, but some models suggest a potential for a rise. Given the uncertainty and the potential for short-term disruption, I'm leaning towards a slightly negative impact, but not as strong as some previous predictions suggested.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about a potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the direct impact on Apple's revenue is unclear, the potential removal of TikTok from the App Store introduces uncertainty and short-term risk.  This uncertainty could lead to market volatility and a temporary negative reaction. However, the long-term impact is likely to be minimal given Apple's diversified revenue streams and overall market dominance.  The potential redirection of TikTok's users and advertising revenue to other platforms, some of which are integrated with Apple's ecosystem, could even offer a slight indirect benefit.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from a 20% to 70% chance of a price fall, and the overall limited direct impact on Apple, a slightly negative but ultimately neutral outlook seems most probable. The uncertainty warrants a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the limited long-term impact suggests the probability of a price rise is not negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple may face legal risks and temporary disruptions if TikTok is removed from its App Store, which could impact user engagement and advertising revenue. However, the primary beneficiaries of TikTok's ban are likely to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP), rather than Apple. Apple's core business is not directly tied to TikTok, and any negative impact is expected to be limited. The potential shift of advertisers to other platforms could indirectly benefit Apple, but this is uncertain. Given the overall minor connection between TikTok's ban and Apple's business, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly negative.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a divided opinion on the impact of the news on Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the general consensus is that the impact will be limited and temporary. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated to be relatively balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary by a specific date.

However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence. The analysis indicates mixed sentiments among various models, with most predicting a slightly lower probability of stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US presents a complex scenario for Apple Inc.

While the removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to short-term disruption and potential negative publicity, the long-term impact on Apple's core business remains uncertain. The redirection of TikTok's users and advertising revenue to other platforms like Instagram and YouTube could indirectly benefit Apple through increased app usage and potential ad revenue, but this benefit is less direct and certain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more negative outlook, but some models suggest a potential for a rise. Given the uncertainty and the potential for short-term disruption, I'm leaning towards a slightly negative impact, but not as strong as some previous predictions suggested. The fact that other models have not significantly shifted their predictions suggests that the market sentiment remains relatively stable regarding this news and its impact on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about a potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.

This uncertainty may lead to market volatility and negative sentiment, impacting the stock price negatively. On the other hand, the long-term impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited because Apple's revenue is far less dependent on TikTok compared to other platforms. Additionally, the potential redirection of TikTok's users and advertisers to platforms like Instagram and YouTube could indirectly benefit Apple through increased app usage and potential ad revenue.
