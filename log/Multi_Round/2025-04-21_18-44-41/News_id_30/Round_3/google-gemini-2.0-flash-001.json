(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The positive revenue forecast provided by Apple, despite mixed holiday results, has reassured investors. The shares climbed more than 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Although there are concerns about declining sales in China and competition in AI, the company's ability to meet or slightly beat analyst expectations for revenue and profit in a challenging market reflects positively on its resilience. The strong performance in services and better-than-expected sales in other categories also support an optimistic outlook, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise compared to decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While the initial reaction was positive, with the stock climbing 3% in late trading after the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, a deeper dive reveals underlying concerns. The 4% revenue growth to $124.3 billion was helped by services revenue which beat analyst expectations. Profit also beat analyst expectations at $2.40 a share. However, there were specific weaknesses notably, the 11% drop in China revenue and the slightly below-expected iPhone sales suggests challenges in a key market and product segment. The company's attempt to catch up to its peers in AI is another potential hurdle, as well as potential new tariffs, while a new CFO may add uncertainty. On the positive side, Mac and iPad lineups performed better than expected. The forecast of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth is in line with expectations. Overall, while the immediate sentiment is positive due to the revenue forecast and some product categories exceeding expectations, the combination of China decline, AI competition, and potential tariffs suggest limited upside.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results were mixed, with revenue beating expectations but showing weakness in China and iPhone sales falling slightly short of projections.  However, the positive aspect was Apple's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, projecting low-to-mid single-digit growth, which aligned with analyst expectations and calmed investor concerns.  While concerns remain about China, competition, and Apple's AI strategy lagging behind competitors, the positive outlook and record services revenue suggest a generally positive outlook. The immediate post-earnings stock price jump of over 3% in after-hours trading indicates a positive market reaction.  Considering this mixed bag of positive and negative factors, a rise is more probable than a fall, but significant uncertainty remains. The probability is weighted more heavily towards a rise due to the positive revenue forecast and the market's immediate positive reaction, but risks related to China, AI competitiveness and potential future tariffs must be acknowledged.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, aligning with analyst expectations, which helped soothe investor concerns. The stock already reacted positively with a 3% climb in late trading. Additionally, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit, are bullish signals. However, challenges remain, including a significant decline in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and struggles in wearables and AI competitiveness. The market seems to be focusing more on the positive guidance and record results, outweighing the negatives. Given the immediate positive market reaction and the overall resilience of Apple's business, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. released a mixed quarterly report with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter. Despite a decline in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and the overall revenue and profit beat analyst estimates. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement. The forecast of low- to mid-single digit growth in the current quarter aligns with analyst predictions, which seems to have soothed investor concerns. However, challenges remain, particularly in China and in terms of AI innovation. Overall, the positive aspects of the report and the revenue forecast appear to outweigh the negative, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results' suggests a mixed bag for Apple's recent quarterly performance. While sales in China and iPhone sales were not as strong as anticipated, the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter and its services revenue growth provided reassurance to investors. The shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating a positive reaction to the forecast. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling. However, challenges such as competition in China, the need to accelerate AI deployment, and potential tariffs could impact future performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed holiday results and significant declines in China and the iPhone sales, but Apple has offered a reassuring revenue forecast with a low to mid-single digits growth rate for the current quarter. Despite challenges, the services division performed strongly, and there were positive signs for the Mac and iPad lines. Moreover, the stock price rebounded by over 3% in late trading which suggests some positive sentiment among investors. However, there are ongoing challenges with AI platforms and market competition, particularly in China.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's recent financial performance presents a mixed outlook, but with a leaning towards positivity due to the reassuring revenue forecast provided for the upcoming quarter. This forecast aligns with analyst expectations, which has calmed investor concerns post-reports of declines in key markets like China. The shares have already shown a positive reaction with over a 3% increase in late trading after the announcement. While challenges remain, particularly in relation to declining sales in China and competition in the AI space, the company's overall revenue and profit outperformed expectations, particularly in the services sector. A significant aspect of the analysis lies in the overall market reaction and the strong performance in areas outside of the immediate concerns, suggesting a higher probability of price rise. Based on the aggregated sentiments from previous predictions and current market response, a probability of stock price rise seems higher than that of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The overall sentiment surrounding Apple is cautiously optimistic. While the holiday results revealed weaknesses in China and iPhone sales, the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter has calmed investors, leading to a 3% rebound in late trading. The strong performance of the services division and the better-than-expected results from Mac and iPad sales also contribute to this positive sentiment. However, ongoing challenges in AI, competition in China, and potential tariffs present risks. Considering the previous rounds of predictions and the immediate market reaction, I am slightly increasing the probability of the stock price rising to reflect this improved, albeit still cautious, outlook. The increasing of the probability of stock price rising takes into consideration the previous round prediction and assumes that since all predictions are above 0.5, some other information about the stock is known by those predictors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter and the exceeding of expectations in some product lines (services, Mac, iPad) are positive and led to a 3% post-market surge, significant headwinds remain.  The substantial decline in Chinese revenue (11%), underperformance of the iPhone (despite a new AI platform), and lagging AI competitiveness against major rivals raise serious concerns. The potential for new tariffs further adds uncertainty.  While the immediate market reaction was positive, focusing on the positive forecast, the underlying issues suggest a less optimistic long-term outlook. The consensus of previous models (averaging around 0.65 probability for a rise) reflects this mixed sentiment. I'm adjusting slightly lower to reflect the persistent concerns regarding China and AI, while acknowledging the positive short-term market reaction. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company reported a decline in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter (low to mid-single digits growth) and strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments have positively influenced investor sentiment. The stock price already reflected this optimism with a 3% climb in late trading. However, challenges such as competition in China, AI competitiveness, and potential tariffs remain. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of stock price rise, given the positive revenue forecast and market reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, projecting low-to-mid single-digit growth, aligned with analyst expectations and helped boost the stock price by over 3% in late trading. Positive aspects include strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit. However, challenges remain, such as a significant decline in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and struggles in wearables and AI competitiveness. Despite these challenges, the immediate positive market reaction and the overall resilience of Apple's business suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed bag for Apple, with a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, but also significant declines in China and iPhone sales. However, the services division performed strongly, and there were positive signs for the Mac and iPad lines. The stock price rebounded by over 3% in late trading, suggesting some positive sentiment among investors. Considering the mixed results and the ongoing challenges with AI platforms and market competition, particularly in China, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of falling. The forecast of low to mid-single digits growth rate for the current quarter and the record services revenue are bullish signals, outweighing the negatives.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed holiday results and significant declines in China and iPhone sales, which initially caused concern. However, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast with a low to mid-single digits growth rate for the current quarter, which was sufficient to soothe investors' concerns. Additionally, the strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit, suggest a relatively positive outlook. The immediate post-earnings stock price jump of over 3% indicates a positive market reaction. While there are ongoing challenges with AI platforms and competition, especially in China, the positive outlook and the fact that the stock price has rebounded from a decline this year lead to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. while the forecast of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth has calmed investor concerns following disappointing holiday results. The stock reacted positively with over a 3% increase after hours, reflecting an optimistic market sentiment. Key factors like strong services revenue and better-than-expected performances from Mac and iPad segments provide additional support. However, significant challenges remain, including a substantial decline in sales in China, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and increasing competition in AI technology. Despite the negatives, the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a rise due to the positive guidance and immediate market reaction, leading to a probability of stock price rise being higher than that of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple. The reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter has calmed investors, leading to a 3% rebound in late trading. Positive signals include strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad sales. However, challenges remain, including declining sales in China, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance (despite AI advancements), lagging AI competitiveness, and potential tariffs. The consensus from previous predictions leaned toward a higher probability of stock price rise. Given the positive revenue forecast, the immediate positive market reaction, and considering that those models might have some known positive information, the probability is slightly increased to reflect the somewhat increased positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results showed a mixed bag. While overall revenue and profit beat expectations, significant declines in China and slightly below-expectation iPhone sales raised concerns.  The reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter (low-to-mid single-digit growth) is the key factor here.  This forecast, in line with analyst projections, calmed investor nerves, leading to a >3% post-market surge.  However, challenges remain: China's importance as a market, the company's lagging AI strategy relative to competitors, and the potential for new tariffs, all introduce uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a consensus leaning towards a price rise, with probabilities generally in the 0.6-0.7 range. The initial positive market reaction reinforces this, but the underlying issues prevent a more strongly bullish outlook. Considering the mixed signals and the possibility of negative future events (trade wars, competition), I'm slightly lowering the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions and taking into account that the previous predictions seem to have incorporated some other information, which suggests a more balanced assesment of the situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news about Apple Inc. presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. While the company reported declines in iPhone sales and significant drops in China revenue, the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter (low to mid-single-digit growth) aligned with analyst expectations and helped boost investor confidence. The stock price already reflected this optimism with a 3% climb in late trading. Positive aspects include strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit. However, challenges such as competition in China, lagging AI competitiveness, and potential tariffs remain. The consensus from previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of stock price rise, given the positive revenue forecast and market reaction. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, projecting low-to-mid single-digit growth, aligned with analyst expectations and helped boost the stock price by over 3% in late trading.

The reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, provided by the company, has calmed investor concerns and led to a positive market reaction, with the stock price climbing over 3% in late trading. The strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, as well as record revenue and profit, are bullish signals. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and struggles in wearables and AI competitiveness remain as challenges. Considering the previous predictions and the overall market reaction, the probability of the stock price rising appears to be higher than that of falling. The forecast of low to mid-single digits growth rate for the current quarter and the record services revenue are key factors supporting this outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed holiday results and significant declines in China and iPhone sales, which initially caused concern.
