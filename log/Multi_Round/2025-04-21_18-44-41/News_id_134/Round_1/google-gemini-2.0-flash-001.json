Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.\nNews Content: For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant shift in the streaming industry, with major players finally reporting profits, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of this momentum, particularly for traditional media companies that need to generate fast-growing profits from streaming to offset declines in their linear businesses. While the overall trend is positive, the uncertainty regarding customer retention and the potential for increased churn may temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of a stock price rise due to the positive news about profitability in the streaming sector, the concerns about sustainability and competition suggest a notable probability of a price fall as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its profitability, with Netflix leading the charge. While Apple is not explicitly mentioned as a major player in the article, the overall trend of streaming profitability could indirectly benefit Apple TV+. However, the article also highlights concerns about subscriber churn, price sensitivity, and the need for fast-growing profits to offset declining linear businesses. The uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of streaming profits and the competitive landscape suggests a mixed outlook. Given Apple's diversified business model, the impact of streaming profitability on its overall stock price is likely to be moderate. The article doesn't provide any specific negative information about Apple, but the general concerns about the streaming industry limit the potential for a significant positive impact. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly positive impact, but also acknowledge the risk of a slight negative impact due to the broader industry concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, highlighting the success of Netflix and the challenges faced by other companies in sustaining this momentum. While the overall trend is positive for the streaming industry, the article emphasizes concerns about maintaining profitability due to factors like subscriber churn, price sensitivity, and competition.  The article does not directly mention Apple's streaming service, Apple TV+, and its performance. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is indirect and likely minimal.  Apple's overall financial health and performance in other sectors will be far more influential on its stock price than the general trends in the streaming industry discussed in this article.  We can assume a neutral to slightly negative impact due to the overall cautious tone regarding the long-term sustainability of streaming profits for the industry as a whole. This cautious outlook might slightly dampen investor enthusiasm for tech stocks, including Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that streaming services, including those from major media companies, have turned profitable in 2024, with Netflix leading the charge. This is a positive development for the sector, indicating improved financial health and strategic adjustments. However, concerns remain about sustainability, price hikes, subscriber retention, and competition. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), which operates Apple TV+, the news is mixed. On one hand, the overall profitability of streaming services is a positive signal for the industry, which could benefit AAPL. On the other hand, the focus on Netflix's dominance and the challenges faced by traditional media companies might not directly translate to a significant positive impact on AAPL's stock. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive effect.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, particularly Netflix, and the challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent profits. The article highlights the progress made by these companies in reducing losses and achieving breakeven, but also notes the concerns about retaining customer base and combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be indirect. However, as a major player in the technology and entertainment industry, AAPL's stock price may be influenced by the overall trends and sentiment in the streaming market. Considering the positive tone of the article regarding the profitability of streaming services, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for major media companies including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges such as subscriber churn and the need for rapid revenue growth to sustain profitability. Apple's stock price could be influenced by the overall sentiment toward the streaming industry. While the profits are encouraging, the uncertain future growth and sustainability could lead to mixed investor reactions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
