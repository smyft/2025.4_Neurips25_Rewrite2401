(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, along with concerns about weak iPhone sales and a lack of consumer interest in AI, suggest negative sentiment around Apple's stock. The significant price target reductions and expectations of lower-than-expected earnings further contribute to a bearish outlook. Additionally, the decline in iPhone sales in China and overall market share loss indicate ongoing challenges for Apple. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Two downgrades from reputable firms (Jefferies and Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales and a lack of AI traction are significant. The specific concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, overall market share decline, and lower revenue forecasts all point to potential downward pressure on the stock. While new product releases are mentioned, their impact is uncertain and doesn't outweigh the immediate negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% midday Tuesday confirms the market's initial negative reaction. The underperformance of Apple stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further strengthens the bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings report on Jan 30th will be crucial, but the lowered expectations set by Jefferies suggest a higher likelihood of a negative surprise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news contains multiple negative factors impacting Apple's stock price.  Two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), a lackluster response to Apple's AI initiatives, and lower-than-expected revenue projections for the next two quarters, all point towards a bearish outlook.  While the introduction of new products (iPhone SE, iPads, MacBooks) might offer some upside, the significant negative factors outweigh the potential positives in the short term. The already observed 3.7% midday drop reflects the market's immediate reaction to the negative news.  While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the current news strongly suggests a higher probability of a short-term price decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales and a less optimistic AI outlook. Analyst Edison Lee from Jefferies downgraded Apple's stock to Underperform and lowered the price target by 13%. The report also mentions declining iPhone market share, particularly in China, and a lack of expected boost from Apple's AI initiatives. These factors suggest negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price. While there are mentions of potential new product launches (iPhone SE, iPads, MacBook Airs), the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales outlook outweighs these positives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been hit with two downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital due to weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers. Jefferies downgraded its rating to Underperform with a decreased price target of $200.75, while Loop Capital downgraded its rating to Hold with a revised price target of $230. The news also mentions that iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year, and overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%. Additionally, Jefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm's prior estimate of 4.6%. These negative factors are likely to impact the stock price negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports two downgrades of Apple's stock by Jefferies and Loop Capital due to weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers. The downgrades, combined with the decline in iPhone sales in China and the overall market share, suggest a negative outlook for the company's stock. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's push into AI is not panning out as expected, which could further impact the stock price. However, the company is set to debut new products, such as a new iPhone SE, entry-level iPads, and MacBook Airs, which could potentially drive improved sales. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades and lowered price targets due to weak iPhone sales and lackluster AI performance. Analysts expect lower-than-anticipated financial results, and current market trends show a negative sentiment towards the stock. The recent stock price drop further indicates investor concerns. While new product rollouts might provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news outweighs any potential positive developments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, along with concerns about weak iPhone sales and a lack of consumer interest in AI, indicate a negative sentiment surrounding Apple's stock. The significant reductions in price targets and expectations of lower-than-expected earnings further contribute to a bearish outlook. Additionally, the decline in iPhone sales in China and overall market share loss suggest ongoing challenges for Apple. While there are mentions of potential new product launches that could provide some upside, the immediate negative factors outweigh these positives. The market's initial reaction, reflected in the 3.7% drop in stock price, supports a higher probability of further declines.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The consensus from the previous round is overwhelmingly bearish, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. This is driven by the downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, concerns about weak iPhone sales (especially in China), and a perceived lack of traction in AI. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% midday Tuesday reinforces this negative sentiment. While new product releases are mentioned, they are not seen as sufficient to offset the negative factors. Given the strong negative sentiment and consistent predictions from multiple models in the previous round, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly stronger bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The overwhelming consensus from previous models and the news itself points towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.  Two significant downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (especially in the crucial Chinese market) and disappointing AI performance, are major negative factors.  The already observed 3.7% drop reflects the market's immediate negative reaction. While new product launches are planned, their impact is uncertain and unlikely to offset the current negative sentiment in the short term. The lowered revenue forecasts further reinforce the bearish outlook.  The previous models' predictions, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 probability of a price rise and 0.7 to 0.8 probability of a price fall, support this assessment.  While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the short-term outlook based on this news is predominantly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to two significant downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales and a lack of consumer interest in AI. The downgrades include reduced price targets, with Jefferies lowering its target to $200.75 and Loop Capital to $230. Additionally, the article highlights declining iPhone sales in China, a key market for Apple, and an overall drop in iPhone market share. Analyst predictions also suggest lower-than-expected revenue growth, further dampening the outlook. While there is mention of upcoming product launches that could potentially boost sales, the immediate impact of the negative news and market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports multiple downgrades and lowered price targets due to weak iPhone sales and a lackluster response to Apple's AI initiatives. Analysts from Jefferies and Loop Capital cite significant concerns, including a 15-20% decline in iPhone sales in China, a 1% decline in iPhone market share, and lower revenue forecasts. These factors contribute to a negative outlook for Apple's stock in the short term. While new product launches might offer some potential upside, the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales outlook appears to outweigh any positives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The news article reports two downgrades of Apple's stock by Jefferies and Loop Capital due to weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.

The lowered price targets and revenue forecasts further reinforce this negative sentiment. The stock's underperformance compared to its peers and the S&P 500, along with the initial 3.7% drop, indicate a strong market reaction to the negative news. While new product releases are planned, their impact is uncertain and unlikely to offset the immediate negative pressures. Previous rounds of predictions also overwhelmingly favored a price decrease. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling remains high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The overwhelming consensus from previous models and the negative news itself strongly suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.
