(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which contrasts with the trend of other companies backing away from such initiatives in the current political climate. This steadfastness may resonate positively with investors who value corporate responsibility and social governance. However, the potential for backlash from conservative groups and the ongoing scrutiny of DEI practices could create uncertainty. Overall, the strong support for Costco's DEI stance suggests that there is still significant investor backing for such policies, which may bode well for Apple. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to political pressure regarding DEI initiatives. While Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is highlighted, the core of the article is about Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal. The article explicitly states Apple is facing a similar challenge and has asked investors to vote down the proposal. This suggests Apple is likely to follow a similar path as Costco. The market reaction to DEI news is complex and depends on investor sentiment. Some investors may view DEI initiatives positively, while others may see them as a distraction from core business objectives or as politically motivated. Given the current political climate and the trend of companies retreating from DEI, there's a slightly higher chance of a negative reaction if Apple faces significant opposition or negative press surrounding its DEI stance. However, the article also mentions that some big banks are holding firm on DEI, suggesting that there is still support for these initiatives. The fact that Apple is actively defending its DEI program suggests that they believe it is important for their business and brand. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slightly higher chance of a small decrease due to the overall negative trend surrounding DEI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a potential shift in the political climate.  While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's steadfast stance, as evidenced by its urging investors to reject a shareholder proposal against its DEI programs, suggests a strong internal belief in the importance of these initiatives. This could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and inclusive corporate cultures. However, the ongoing legal and political challenges surrounding DEI could create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the overall market conditions and the potential for negative reactions from investors who oppose DEI initiatives.  The probability of a price fall is also relatively low, as Apple's strong financial performance and brand reputation are likely to outweigh the impact of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite increasing political and social pressure to abandon such initiatives. Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that seeks to assess risks associated with its DEI programs. This aligns Apple with companies like Costco, which successfully defended its DEI stance, and contrasts with others like Meta, Walmart, and Target, which have retreated from DEI commitments. The market's reaction to such news can be mixed. On one hand, maintaining DEI policies may appeal to socially conscious investors and consumers, potentially bolstering Apple's brand reputation and customer loyalty. On the other hand, political and legal challenges could introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and historical resilience to political pressures, the positive impact on investor sentiment may outweigh the negatives. However, the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the broader political and legal risks mentioned in the article.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, noting that Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that would have required the company to assess risks from its DEI programs. This indicates that Apple is committed to its DEI practices despite a challenging environment where several other companies are backing away from similar initiatives. Given that Apple's commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility and potentially mitigate risks associated with backlash against DEI initiatives, there could be a positive impact on the stock price. However, the overall market reaction may be nuanced based on investor priorities and the company's performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses how some companies, including Apple, are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite facing challenges from conservative groups. This suggests that Apple is committed to its values and is not backing down from its stance. The fact that Costco, another major company, successfully pushed back against a similar challenge and had 98% of its investors side with the company, sets a positive precedent for Apple. Additionally, the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have also expressed their commitment to DEI efforts, indicating a trend of major companies standing firm on this issue. This could lead to a positive perception of Apple among investors and customers who value diversity and inclusion, potentially driving up the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs amidst a general trend among other companies to retreat from such initiatives. This demonstrates Apple's commitment to progressive values and inclusivity, which is likely to resonate positively with its stakeholders, particularly investors who value socially responsible investments. Given Apple's prominence and influence in the tech industry, this commitment can further enhance its brand reputation, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and, consequently, a higher stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which contrasts with the trend of other companies retreating from such initiatives. This steadfastness may resonate positively with investors who value corporate responsibility and social governance. The successful defense of DEI by Costco suggests that there is still significant investor backing for such policies, which may bode well for Apple. However, the ongoing scrutiny and potential backlash from conservative groups could create uncertainty. Overall, while there are risks associated with the political climate, Apple's strong brand reputation and commitment to DEI initiatives are likely to attract positive investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The previous rounds show a general consensus that Apple's stance on DEI, in contrast to other companies retreating, is likely to be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. The success of Costco in defending its DEI policies further strengthens this view. However, the potential for backlash from conservative groups and legal challenges remains a concern. Considering the trend of increasing positive predictions in the previous rounds, I will slightly increase the probability of a stock price rise, while acknowledging the inherent risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives, contrasting with the retreat of other companies, could be viewed positively by some investors, the ongoing political and legal challenges surrounding DEI create uncertainty.  The successful Costco vote provides some positive reinforcement, but the article also highlights potential legal challenges facing other companies with similar policies.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price increase due to Apple's strong brand and commitment to DEI, while others predict a price decrease due to the broader negative trend around DEI and potential investor backlash. Considering this, a neutral stance seems most appropriate, with a slightly higher probability of a price rise given Apple's generally strong performance and the positive precedent set by Costco.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s commitment to its DEI policies despite political and social pressures, contrasting with other companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's stance aligns with Costco, which successfully defended its DEI policies with overwhelming investor support (98%). This suggests strong investor backing for DEI, which could positively influence Apple's stock price. Additionally, Apple's strong brand and historical resilience to political pressures further support a positive outlook. However, potential legal and political challenges introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment from socially conscious investors and Apple's firm stance outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite increasing scrutiny and pressure from conservative groups and a changing political climate. Several companies have recently backed away from DEI initiatives, but Apple, along with Costco, has successfully defended its stance. This commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the stock price. However, there's also potential for backlash from investors who oppose DEI initiatives or are concerned about the political risks associated with them. Given the current trend and the strong stance taken by Apple, the probability of a stock price rise seems higher than that of a fall, but the overall market conditions and investor priorities will play a crucial role in determining the actual impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility.

The majority of previous predictions indicate a positive outlook for Apple's stock price due to its DEI stance. Taking all factors into account, the overall impact is expected to be slightly positive.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: Apple's commitment to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, especially in contrast to other companies retreating from such initiatives, positions it favorably among socially conscious investors. The successful defense of DEI by Costco serves as a positive precedent, suggesting that there is significant investor backing for such policies. While there are risks associated with potential backlash from conservative groups and ongoing scrutiny of DEI practices, Apple's strong brand reputation and historical resilience to political pressures are likely to attract positive investor sentiment.
