(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?\nNews Content: DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership.

While Apple reported a modest earnings increase, the overall market reaction to the Mag 7 earnings suggests a cautious outlook. The mention of tepid iPhone demand in China and potential tariffs adds to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the competitive landscape and market skepticism, leading to a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings were up, the market reception was lukewarm, described as a \"sigh of relief\" rather than strong endorsement. The major concern is China, with tepid iPhone demand and increased competition. The potential for tariffs poses a significant risk. The news also highlights the broader tech sector's AI spending and the market's skepticism about monetization, which could indirectly affect Apple's valuation. Considering these factors, the negative aspects outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations and received favorable market reception, this was attributed more to relief than strong performance.  Concerns remain about tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and the potential impact of tariffs.  The article highlights the significant AI investments by other tech giants (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), questioning their monetization strategy and suggesting Apple's AI struggles are a significant headwind.  The overall positive sentiment in the tech sector and the broader S&P 500 earnings season might offer some support to Apple's stock price. However, the specific challenges faced by Apple in China and its AI development outweigh the general positive market trends in this context. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights several key points affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). Firstly, Apple's earnings and revenues for the December quarter showed modest growth (+7.1% and +4% respectively), with net margins improving by 86 basis points. However, the company faces significant challenges in China, including tepid iPhone demand and increased competition from local players. Additionally, Apple's struggles in AI and potential tariffs are noted as risks. While the market reacted favorably to Apple's better-than-feared results, the underlying issues in China and AI could weigh on investor sentiment. The broader context of the 'Mag 7' earnings shows mixed performance, with some peers like Meta outperforming while others like Microsoft disappointed in certain areas. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by a combination of relief from the earnings report and concerns over future growth prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the recent earnings reports of the 'Mag 7' companies, including Apple, and the impact of DeepSeek on the AI competitive landscape. While Apple's December-quarter earnings were up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues, the company faces risks such as tepid iPhone demand in China and AI struggles. The article also mentions that the market's focus was on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, and that Apple and Tesla received favorable market reception despite some concerns. Given the mixed signals and the fact that the positive market follow-through was likely a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple's earnings showed moderate growth, there are concerns regarding China's market performance and ongoing AI struggles. The market might react positively if Apple provides reassurance about addressing these issues, but negative sentiment could persist if no significant improvement is indicated.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company reported modest earnings growth, concerns about tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and potential tariffs weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The broader tech sector's performance, particularly the mixed results from other 'Mag 7' companies, adds to the uncertainty. Although there was a positive market reaction to Apple's earnings, it was more of a relief than a strong endorsement. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings were up, the market reception was lukewarm, described as a \"sigh of relief\" rather than strong endorsement. The major concern is China, with tepid iPhone demand and increased competition. The potential for tariffs poses a significant risk. The news also highlights the broader tech sector's AI spending and the market's skepticism about monetization, which could indirectly affect Apple's valuation. Considering these factors, the negative aspects outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall. The previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple beat earnings expectations and saw net margin improvement, the market reaction was muted, suggesting relief rather than excitement.  Significant headwinds exist: tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese brands, and struggles in the AI sector.  The potential for tariffs further adds to the uncertainty. Although the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges outweigh the general positive sentiment.  The previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.6. Considering these factors, I slightly adjust the probability of a price fall upwards to reflect the persistent concerns surrounding Apple's performance in China and its AI development.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported a 7.1% increase in earnings and a 4% rise in revenues for the December quarter, with net margins improving by 86 basis points. The market initially reacted favorably to these better-than-feared results. However, significant challenges remain, including tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local players, and ongoing struggles in AI development. Additionally, potential tariffs pose a further risk. The broader context of the 'Mag 7' earnings shows mixed performance among peers, with some outperforming (e.g., Meta) while others (e.g., Microsoft) disappointed in certain areas. Given these factors, while the immediate market reaction may be positive due to relief, the underlying issues in China and AI could weigh on investor sentiment in the near term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed sentiments regarding Apple's performance amidst competitive pressures, particularly from Chinese competitors and concerns over AI investments.

(AAPL). Apple's earnings and revenues for the December quarter showed modest growth, and the company experienced improved net margins. However, there are significant concerns regarding tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local players, and the ongoing challenges in AI development. Despite receiving a favorable market reception for better-than-feared results, the underlying issues in key markets and technological advancements pose risks. The broader context of the 'Mag 7' earnings indicates mixed performance, adding to the uncertainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company reported modest earnings growth of 7.1% and a 4% increase in revenues, the market's reaction was more of a relief than strong enthusiasm, indicating underlying concerns. Significant risks include tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local brands, and ongoing struggles in AI development. Additionally, potential tariffs pose a further threat to Apple's performance. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise, reflecting the cautious sentiment among investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While earnings showed modest growth and margins improved, the market reaction was lukewarm, suggesting relief rather than strong confidence. Key concerns revolve around tepid iPhone demand in China, increasing competition from local players, and Apple's struggles in AI. The potential for tariffs adds another layer of uncertainty.
