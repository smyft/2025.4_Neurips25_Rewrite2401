(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland.

Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive relationship between Apple CEO Tim Cook and the incoming Trump administration, which could lead to favorable policies for Apple, particularly regarding tariffs and antitrust issues. The tech industry is generally seen as pro-business under Trump's leadership, which may boost investor confidence in Apple. However, the historical volatility of political relationships and potential backlash from consumers or investors who oppose Trump's policies could introduce some risk. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price due to the potential for favorable business conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) despite potential political complexities. Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and Apple's contribution to the event indicate a willingness to engage with the new administration. This engagement could be beneficial for Apple in addressing key concerns such as tariffs and antitrust issues. While Trump's past unpredictability introduces some risk, the proactive approach of Apple's leadership suggests a calculated effort to mitigate potential negative impacts and potentially gain favorable policy outcomes. The tech industry's overall move to align with Trump suggests a pragmatic approach to navigating the political landscape, which could lead to a more stable regulatory environment for Apple. However, public perception of Apple's alignment with Trump could be a risk factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns.  While this might suggest a positive relationship and potential benefits for Apple (e.g., reduced tariffs, favorable antitrust treatment), the article also notes that Trump has a history of sparring with tech leaders.  The overall tone is neutral, suggesting that while there's potential for positive impacts, there's also uncertainty.  The article emphasizes that many tech companies are donating to Trump regardless of past conflicts, suggesting a pragmatic approach to navigating the political landscape.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term, as the news itself doesn't contain any concrete policy changes or announcements that would significantly affect Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook has historically had a good relationship with Donald Trump and is attending his inauguration, along with other tech leaders. This indicates a potential for favorable business policies or reduced regulatory pressures under the new administration, which could benefit Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing antitrust issues and potential tariffs that could impact Apple's revenue. Overall, the positive relationship with the president-elect and potential for favorable policies may outweigh the negative aspects, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that tech industry leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to President Trump, which could lead to favorable business conditions and government contracts. This could positively impact Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that Trump has publicly sparred with some tech leaders in the past, which could lead to uncertainty and potentially negative consequences. Considering the current situation, it seems that the tech industry is trying to build a good relationship with the president, which could lead to more benefits than drawbacks for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates that major tech companies and their CEOs, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are supporting Trump's re-election and inauguration. This suggests a strategic alignment between tech companies and the administration, potentially leading to favorable policies and contracts. However, there is also a historical tension between tech leaders and Trump, which might cause uncertainty among investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
