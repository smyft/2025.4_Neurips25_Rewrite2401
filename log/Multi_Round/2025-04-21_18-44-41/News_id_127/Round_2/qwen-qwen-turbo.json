(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant earnings reports expected from major tech companies, including Apple. The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a stable economic outlook. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates, which typically supports stock prices. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of Apple\u2019s stock price rising, especially if their earnings report meets or exceeds expectations. However, there is still a risk of volatility due to the Fed's press conference and potential market reactions to Trump's policies, which could lead to a slight chance of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors influencing Apple's stock price. The overall market sentiment is positive, indicated by the S&P 500's strong performance and the initial market reaction to Trump's policies. The upcoming Fed meeting is a potential source of volatility, but JPMorgan expects a 'duck and cover' approach from Powell, suggesting limited immediate impact. The economic data releases (GDP and PCE) could influence market sentiment, but RBC Capital Markets suggests they might be overshadowed by Trump's policies. Crucially, Apple is reporting earnings this week, and the performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks is critical for overall market growth. Given the positive market momentum and the expectation of strong earnings from Big Tech, there's a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising. However, the potential for negative surprises in earnings or unexpected comments from the Fed or Trump introduces some downside risk. The probability of a rise is estimated at 0.65, while the probability of a fall is estimated at 0.35.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance fueled by Trump's policies (less focus on tariffs, AI investment boost), and the expectation of strong Q4 earnings for Apple and the tech sector as a whole.  However, counterbalancing this is the upcoming Fed meeting, where Powell's comments on interest rates and future policy could negatively impact the market, including tech stocks.  The overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) also carry uncertainty, potentially overshadowing the earnings report.  Given the strong recent market performance and the generally positive sentiment towards tech, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher, but the uncertainty surrounding the Fed and economic data introduces significant risk of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price in the near term. Positive factors include the overall market rally, especially in tech stocks, driven by a lack of disruptive tariff policies from the new Trump administration and a significant AI investment announcement. Additionally, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to report strong earnings growth. However, potential risks include the Federal Reserve's policy decision and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple, and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on the stock market. The article also mentions the positive start to the year for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, with the tech sector leading gains. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry, a strong earnings report could boost the stock price. However, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged may not have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that the market's fears on tariffs were not realized, and the AI trade came back to the fore, which could positively impact Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a key Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is part of the Big Tech earnings reports which are seen as crucial. The positive market sentiment and the rally experienced in previous weeks suggest a potentially optimistic view on earnings. However, any specific news about Trump's policies or the Fed's decisions can impact overall market sentiment. Given the importance of Apple's earnings and the current market conditions, there's a high likelihood of positive reception to its earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive sentiment in the market, particularly for tech stocks, driven by strong earnings expectations and a lack of disruptive tariff policies from the new Trump administration. Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to be strong, aligning with the overall positive outlook for the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks. While the Federal Reserve's meeting could introduce some volatility, the expectation of steady interest rates and the positive economic indicators suggest a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to strong market performance, anticipated positive earnings from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, and a stable interest rate environment. However, potential volatility from the Fed's press conference, economic data releases, and Trump's policies introduces some uncertainty. Considering the generally positive sentiment and Apple's significance in the tech sector, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a price rise, while acknowledging the downside risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the strong overall market performance, particularly in the tech sector, driven by positive initial reactions to Trump's policies and a significant AI investment announcement.  Apple's upcoming earnings report is crucial, and strong results are expected for the company and the broader tech sector. However, counterbalancing these positives are the upcoming Fed meeting and economic data releases.  While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady, Powell's comments could still impact the market.  The economic data (GDP, inflation) also introduces uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight majority leaning towards a price rise. Considering the positive market momentum and the expectation of strong earnings, but acknowledging the risks associated with the Fed and economic data, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall.  The consensus of previous models also influences my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant earnings reports expected from major tech companies, including Apple.

However, there is still a risk of volatility due to the Fed's press conference and potential market reactions to Trump's policies, which could lead to a slight chance of a price decline. Considering the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a higher probability of a rise, and the current positive market conditions, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive market sentiment driven by strong performances in the tech sector and a lack of disruptive policies from the new Trump administration. Apple's stock price is likely to be influenced by its upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be strong given the overall positive outlook for Big Tech. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged is also seen as supportive of stock prices. However, potential risks include unexpected comments from the Fed or Trump, as well as economic data releases. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment appears positive, driven by a rally in tech stocks and a stable economic outlook. The news highlights a strong start to the earnings season for the S&P 500, with significant earnings reports expected from major tech companies, including Apple.

Apple, being one of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, is expected to report earnings that could significantly influence the market. The market is currently optimistic, with several factors supporting a positive outlook such as less emphasis on tariffs, AI investments, and overall strong market performance. However, there is a risk associated with the Fed's policy decision and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility. Overall, the positive factors outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
