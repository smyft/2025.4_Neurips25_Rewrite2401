(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple lifts US stock index futures as crucial inflation test looms\nNews Content: (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for Apple with a strong sales growth forecast that has led to a 3.4% rise in premarket trading. Given the broader market's focus on inflation data, and the general upward movement in U.S. stock index futures, this bodes well for Apple's stock. Investors appear reassured by Apple's revenue growth guidance, despite broader market volatility linked to tech stocks. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple (AAPL). The stock is up 3.4% in premarket trading due to a strong sales growth forecast, indicating recovery from iPhone sales decline and anticipation of AI features. Analyst commentary is reassuring. However, broader market volatility exists due to inflation data uncertainty, DeepSeek's AI breakthrough impacting other tech stocks, and Trump's tariff threats. PCE data is key as positive deviation may impact inflation and Fed actions. Although Apple is set to open higher, overall market sentiment after PCE is the deciding factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a 3.4% premarket gain following a strong sales growth forecast, suggesting investor confidence in the company's ability to overcome recent challenges (iPhone sales dip).  Deutsche Bank's positive analyst note further reinforces this positive sentiment. While the upcoming inflation data and broader market volatility (impacted by events like DeepSeek's AI breakthrough and Trump's tariff comments) introduce uncertainty, Apple's strong earnings and forecast significantly outweigh the negative factors in the short term.  The overall market also shows positive movement in pre-market trading and is on track for monthly gains, further boosting the likelihood of AAPL continuing its upward trajectory.  However, external factors beyond Apple's control, like inflation data and broader market reactions, still pose a degree of risk. Therefore, while a price rise is most likely, the probability is not absolute.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has driven U.S. stock index futures higher due to a strong sales growth forecast, particularly with the introduction of AI features. The company's premarket trading showed a 3.4% gain, and analysts are reassured by the guidance of low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in the coming quarter. Despite broader market volatility, Apple's positive outlook and investor confidence suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise. The upcoming inflation data could introduce some uncertainty, but the immediate impact of Apple's earnings and forecast is likely to dominate in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock rose 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. The company's executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, indicating a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive forecast and the subsequent rise in premarket trading suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock. However, the overall market sentiment is cautious ahead of the key inflation data release, which could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions. Despite this, the immediate reaction to Apple's forecast suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's stock price rose 3.4% in premarket trading after the company forecast relatively strong sales growth, which is a positive signal for the stock. Additionally, the overall market sentiment seems to be positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. However, the report also mentions that the market is awaiting key inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, which could introduce some uncertainty. Nevertheless, based on the information provided, the positive earnings forecast and premarket trading gains suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong positive outlook for Apple as its executives predicted relatively strong sales growth, driving gains in Apple and uplifting U.S. stock index futures. The market response is favorable towards Apple's projected recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI feature rollouts. However, the broader economic climate, including inflation data and geopolitical uncertainties, may introduce some volatility. Overall, Apple's outlook seems positive given the news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
