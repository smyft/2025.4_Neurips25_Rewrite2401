(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban primarily affects companies like Oracle, Apple, and Google, as they are involved in the app's distribution and functionality. For Apple, the removal of TikTok from its app store could lead to a decrease in user engagement and app revenue, particularly among younger demographics who are significant users of TikTok. However, the overall impact on Apple's business may be mitigated by its diverse product offerings and services. Given the uncertainty surrounding the ban and its implications, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline due to potential negative sentiment and market reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. While Apple is mentioned in the context of removing TikTok from its app store and ceasing updates, the overall impact on Apple's business is likely to be minimal. Apple is a large, diversified company, and the absence of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The article mentions that Apple declined to comment, suggesting they don't see this as a major issue. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement in either direction. However, there might be a slight negative sentiment due to the association with a controversial ban, but it's unlikely to be substantial.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impending ban of TikTok in the US and the measures being taken to enforce it.  Apple's role is significant as it will be removing TikTok from its app store and will no longer distribute updates. While the direct financial impact on Apple from losing TikTok's app store revenue might be relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue, the news highlights Apple's compliance with US government regulations.  The potential for negative sentiment towards Apple due to the ban is low, as Apple is simply complying with the law.  There's no indication of any direct negative consequences for Apple's business or reputation.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price drop is low, and the probability of a price rise or remaining unchanged is higher. The overall market reaction is likely to be muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S., which could impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it would require Apple to remove TikTok from its App Store and cease updates for the app. While this could reduce app-related revenue and potentially affect user engagement with Apple devices, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Apple's revenue is diversified across hardware, services, and other apps, and TikTok's removal is not expected to significantly disrupt its business. However, there might be slight negative sentiment due to the perceived overreach of government regulation on tech platforms. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but both probabilities are relatively close to neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about a potential TikTok ban in the United States does not have a direct significant impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The ban primarily affects TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance, and its operations in the U.S. While the article mentions that Apple, as the provider of the App Store, would be involved in removing TikTok from its stores and not distributing updates, this action is more of a neutral or compliance-related activity rather than a driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall effect on Apple's business operations and revenue is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the company's app store would be required to remove the TikTok app. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as the company's app store is just one of many revenue streams. Additionally, Apple's business is diversified across various products and services, including iPhones, Macs, iPads, Apple Watch, and AirPods. The ban on TikTok would likely have a greater impact on ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, rather than Apple. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple\u2019s App Store if the app is removed. While this news may not directly affect Apple\u2019s core business, any disruption in popular apps can lead to market uncertainty. However, the impact on Apple's stock could be minimal as the company has a diversified portfolio and a strong track record. The news does not indicate a direct threat to Apple\u2019s earnings or major operations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban primarily affects companies like Apple, which is involved in the app's distribution. While the removal of TikTok from the App Store may lead to some negative sentiment, the overall impact on Apple's diverse revenue streams is expected to be minimal. Previous predictions indicate a slight inclination towards a stock price decline, but the probabilities are relatively balanced. Given Apple's strong market position and diversified business model, the likelihood of a significant stock price movement is low, with a slight edge towards a fall due to the uncertainty surrounding the ban.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The previous rounds show a consistent sentiment that the TikTok ban has a limited direct impact on Apple's stock price. While Apple would need to remove TikTok from its app store, the overall effect on Apple's revenue and user base is considered minimal due to its diversified business. The consensus leans towards a slight negative sentiment or no significant change. Considering this, I will adjust the probabilities slightly towards a neutral position, acknowledging the potential for minor negative sentiment but recognizing Apple's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news regarding a potential TikTok ban in the US has limited direct impact on Apple's core business. While Apple will remove TikTok from its app store, this is a compliance action, not a significant revenue loss.  Apple's vast diversification across hardware, software, and services minimizes the potential negative impact. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the consensus is that the impact will be minimal.  The uncertainty surrounding the ban's actual effect and the potential for minimal market reaction lead to a prediction closer to neutral.  The slight negative sentiment stemming from the association with government regulation is considered, but it's unlikely to significantly outweigh the overall minimal impact on Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the U.S. primarily affects Apple Inc.

The market reaction is likely to be muted, with slight negative sentiment due to regulatory compliance. Previous predictions suggest a balanced view, with most models indicating minimal impact. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and the relatively small direct effect of the TikTok ban, the probabilities are close to neutral with a slight tilt towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the United States mentions Apple's role in removing TikTok from its App Store and ceasing updates. While this could lead to a slight negative sentiment due to the association with a controversial ban, Apple's overall business is diversified and not significantly dependent on TikTok. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, with a balanced probability of rise or fall. However, considering the general market reaction to regulatory news and potential concerns about user engagement, there is a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about a potential TikTok ban in the United States primarily affects TikTok and its operations, with Apple Inc. being involved as the provider of the App Store. The removal of TikTok from the App Store and the cessation of updates may have a minimal impact on Apple's revenue and user engagement. Considering the diversified portfolio of Apple and the lack of direct significant impact on its business operations, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced. However, given the potential for slight negative sentiment due to the perceived overreach of government regulation on tech platforms and the compliance-related activities Apple must undertake, there might be a slight inclination towards a stock price fall. The analysis of previous predictions shows a range of perspectives, with some models indicating a higher probability of a fall and others suggesting minimal impact. Taking into account the overall context and the nature of Apple's business, the estimated probabilities are closer to neutral, with a slight edge towards a potential fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple\u2019s App Store if the app is removed.
