      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's muted spending on AI compared to its peers may raise concerns among investors about its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. While the company is still a leader in many areas, the significant investments by competitors like Meta could lead to a perception that Apple is falling behind in AI innovation. This could negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and financial position may mitigate some of this risk, resulting in a lower probability of a significant rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers. While the article mentions DeepSeek validating Apple's approach, the overall tone implies potential underinvestment in a crucial growth area. Meta's significant investment in AI highlights the competitive pressure. Investors might perceive Apple's lower spending as a risk of falling behind in the AI race, potentially impacting future growth and market share. However, the validation from DeepSeek could mitigate some negative sentiment. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta are not necessarily a benchmark for success; they could represent overspending or a less efficient allocation of resources.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight negative reaction is possible due to the prevailing narrative around the importance of AI investment, but the validation by DeepSeek and Apple's history of strong financial performance mitigate this risk.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta Platforms, which is investing heavily in AI. This conservative approach by Apple might be perceived negatively by investors who prioritize aggressive AI development as a growth driver. However, the mention of 'DeepSeek Validates the Approach' suggests that there is some external validation of Apple's strategy, which could mitigate negative sentiment. Given the mixed implications, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher due to potential concerns over lagging in AI investment, but not significantly so because of the validation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's approach to AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, implying that Apple's muted spending on AI might be a strategic or validated choice rather than a shortcoming. However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers on AI, which could be perceived as a potential disadvantage in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. The overall impact on the stock price will depend on investors' perception of whether Apple's conservative AI spending strategy is a wise decision or a missed opportunity. Given that the news does not introduce any directly negative information about Apple's financials or operations but rather provides a comparative perspective on spending, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. This is because the validation by DeepSeek and the lack of negative financial news could maintain or slightly boost investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's cautious approach to AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, implying that the company's strategy may be more prudent than its peers. This could lead to a positive perception of Apple's financial management and strategic decisions, potentially boosting investor confidence. However, the article also mentions that other companies, such as Meta, are investing heavily in AI, which could lead to concerns that Apple is falling behind in the AI race. Overall, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the validation of its approach may outweigh concerns about its relatively low AI spending.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, which may raise concerns about its competitiveness in the tech landscape. However, the validation from DeepSeek suggests that this approach could be strategic rather than a shortcoming. While there is a risk of negative sentiment due to perceived underinvestment in AI, Apple's strong brand and financial position may mitigate this risk. The mixed implications lead to a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, but the validation and Apple's historical performance provide some support for a potential rise. Overall, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight lean towards a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, its lower AI spending compared to peers like Meta could be seen as a disadvantage, potentially leading to concerns about falling behind in the AI race. This is reflected in the initial predictions, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall. However, the validation from DeepSeek suggests that Apple's approach might be strategic and efficient, mitigating some of the negative sentiment. Some models even interpreted this as a sign of prudent financial management. The later models, particularly meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, leaned towards a more neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering these factors and the trend of previous predictions, I believe the market reaction will be less negative than initially anticipated. The validation from DeepSeek and Apple's strong financial position will likely provide some support. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly more balanced view, with a slight edge towards a price fall, but not as pronounced as the initial predictions suggested.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture.  While Apple's lower AI spending compared to competitors like Meta could be viewed negatively, suggesting a potential lag in AI innovation, the validation by DeepSeek suggests Apple's strategy might be sound and efficient.  The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from a 35% to 55% probability of a price rise.  The consensus seems to lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the uncertainty is significant.  Meta's massive AI investment is a double-edged sword; it highlights the importance of AI but also raises the possibility of overspending.  Apple's history of strong financial performance and brand loyalty are mitigating factors. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent and the validation from DeepSeek. However, the risk of a price fall due to the perception of lagging in AI investment remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's relatively muted spending on AI compared to its peers, such as Meta, which is investing heavily in AI. While this could raise concerns about Apple's competitiveness in the AI space, the validation from DeepSeek suggests that Apple's approach may be strategic and prudent. The mixed implications of the news\u2014potential concerns about lagging in AI investment versus the validation of Apple's strategy\u2014lead to a balanced view. Considering the previous predictions, which show a slight tilt towards a negative impact but with significant support for a neutral to positive outcome, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising due to the validation and Apple's strong financial position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's muted AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, suggesting that the company's conservative approach to AI investment may be strategic rather than a shortcoming. However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers, such as Meta, which is investing heavily in AI. This contrast in spending could lead to mixed perceptions among investors. Some might view Apple's approach as prudent and focused on profitability, while others might see it as a risk of falling behind in the AI race. Considering the validation by DeepSeek and the lack of directly negative financial news, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.

While lower spending compared to peers like Meta initially suggests a potential competitive disadvantage, the validation by DeepSeek introduces a counter-narrative.  The previous predictions show a shift towards a more neutral or slightly positive outlook after the initial negative sentiment.  The consensus seems to be that Apple's historically strong financial performance and brand loyalty mitigate the risk associated with lower AI investment.  The validation from DeepSeek is a key factor, suggesting that Apple's strategy might be more efficient or strategically sound than a simple comparison to competitors' spending would indicate.  The massive investment by Meta could also be interpreted as potentially inefficient spending, further supporting Apple's more conservative approach.  Considering the evolving predictions and the mixed signals in the news, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most likely.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent and the validation from DeepSeek as a positive signal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed signal for Apple. On one hand, Apple's lower spending on AI compared to peers like Meta could be seen as a negative, potentially indicating a lag in the AI race which is crucial for tech companies. On the other hand, the validation from DeepSeek suggests that Apple's approach might be strategic and efficient, which could be viewed positively by investors. Previous predictions mostly leaned slightly towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, but the trend shows a gradual shift towards a more balanced view, especially after considering the validation. Apple's strong brand and financial position also provide a buffer against negative sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's muted AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, suggesting that the company's conservative approach to AI investment may be strategic rather than a shortcoming.
