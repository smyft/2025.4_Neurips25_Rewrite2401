However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers on AI, which could be perceived as a potential disadvantage in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. The overall impact on the stock price will depend on investors' perception of whether Apple's conservative AI spending strategy is a wise decision or a missed opportunity. Given that the news does not introduce any directly negative information about Apple's financials or operations but rather provides a comparative perspective on spending, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. This is because the validation by DeepSeek and the lack of negative financial news could maintain or slightly boost investor confidence.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
