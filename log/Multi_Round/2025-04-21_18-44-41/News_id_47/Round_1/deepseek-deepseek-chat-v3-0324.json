      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's muted spending on AI compared to its peers may raise concerns among investors about its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. While the company is still a leader in many areas, the significant investments by competitors like Meta could lead to a perception that Apple is falling behind in AI innovation. This could negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and financial position may mitigate some of this risk, resulting in a lower probability of a significant rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers. While the article mentions DeepSeek validating Apple's approach, the overall tone implies potential underinvestment in a crucial growth area. Meta's significant investment in AI highlights the competitive pressure. Investors might perceive Apple's lower spending as a risk of falling behind in the AI race, potentially impacting future growth and market share. However, the validation from DeepSeek could mitigate some negative sentiment. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be interpreted as a sign of Apple's disciplined approach to spending and a focus on profitability.  The article mentions DeepSeek validating this approach, implying that Apple's strategy might be sound.  The massive AI investments by competitors like Meta are not necessarily a benchmark for success; they could represent overspending or a less efficient allocation of resources.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight negative reaction is possible due to the prevailing narrative around the importance of AI investment, but the validation by DeepSeek and Apple's history of strong financial performance mitigate this risk.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, reflecting the potential for investors to see Apple's approach as prudent.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta Platforms, which is investing heavily in AI. This conservative approach by Apple might be perceived negatively by investors who prioritize aggressive AI development as a growth driver. However, the mention of 'DeepSeek Validates the Approach' suggests that there is some external validation of Apple's strategy, which could mitigate negative sentiment. Given the mixed implications, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher due to potential concerns over lagging in AI investment, but not significantly so because of the validation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's approach to AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, implying that Apple's muted spending on AI might be a strategic or validated choice rather than a shortcoming. However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers on AI, which could be perceived as a potential disadvantage in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. The overall impact on the stock price will depend on investors' perception of whether Apple's conservative AI spending strategy is a wise decision or a missed opportunity. Given that the news does not introduce any directly negative information about Apple's financials or operations but rather provides a comparative perspective on spending, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. This is because the validation by DeepSeek and the lack of negative financial news could maintain or slightly boost investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's cautious approach to AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, implying that the company's strategy may be more prudent than its peers. This could lead to a positive perception of Apple's financial management and strategic decisions, potentially boosting investor confidence. However, the article also mentions that other companies, such as Meta, are investing heavily in AI, which could lead to concerns that Apple is falling behind in the AI race. Overall, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the validation of its approach may outweigh concerns about its relatively low AI spending.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
