      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\nNews Content: The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption and expenditures index, rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a broader market concern with the Dow Jones diving due to external factors like Trump's tariff order, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple and Nvidia are mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting some resilience or positive momentum in their stocks. The inflation data could also influence market dynamics, but the immediate impact on Apple is less clear. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive performance of Apple and Nvidia despite the overall market decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates negative pressure on the Dow Jones due to Trump's tariff order. It also mentions Apple breaking key levels, which usually implies a downward trend. While the article mentions MicroStrategy's move, its direct impact on Apple is unclear from this snippet. The inflation data (PCE index) is a mixed bag; while it shows inflation is present, it's not drastically high, so its impact is likely neutral to slightly negative as it reinforces the Fed's cautious stance. Overall, the negative aspects (tariffs, breaking key levels) outweigh the neutral/slightly negative inflation data, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple broke a key level, suggesting a negative short-term trend.  The broader market context is also negative, with the Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order. While the inflation data (PCE index) is relevant to the overall economy and could impact Apple indirectly, the headline's focus is on the immediate negative impact of the tariff order and Apple's price action.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following this news.  However, it's important to note that this is a short-term prediction based on limited information and doesn't account for long-term factors or other news that may emerge.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on a Trump tariff order, and mentions that Apple (AAPL) has broken key levels. Additionally, the PCE index rising suggests inflationary pressures, which could lead to concerns about higher interest rates. These factors combined are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that the Dow Jones dives on Trump's tariff order and that Apple (AAPL) breaks key levels. This suggests a negative impact on the stock market and specifically on Apple. Additionally, the content mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge rising, which could imply potential interest rate changes and further market volatility. Given this context, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news mentions that the Dow Jones dives due to Trump's tariff order and Apple breaks key levels, which could indicate a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the news also mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge rose, which could have a mixed effect on the stock market. Considering the direct mention of Apple breaking key levels in a negative context, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that the Dow Jones is diving due to Trump's tariff order, which suggests a bearish market sentiment. However, the article also states that Apple and Nvidia broke key levels, indicating strong performance for these companies despite broader market pressures. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge increased slightly, which could be seen as a sign of economic growth but might also lead to concerns over interest rate hikes. Given these factors, there is a moderate expectation that Apple could outperform the market, but there is still uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment in the broader market due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order, which typically negatively impacts investor sentiment. However, Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting some resilience or positive momentum. The inflation data shows a slight increase, which could lead to concerns about interest rates but is not drastically high. Given the mixed signals, with the overall market pressure weighing heavily, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall, but the positive performance of Apple could mitigate this to some extent.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from previous rounds leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the Dow Jones' decline and Apple breaking key levels. The inflation data adds a layer of complexity, but the immediate negative signals seem to outweigh any potential positive interpretations. Considering the consistency in the previous predictions, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a stronger negative sentiment, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in stock price movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture.  The Dow Jones' dive due to Trump's tariff order suggests a negative market sentiment, which would likely pressure Apple's stock.  However, the news also highlights Apple breaking key levels, which could be interpreted as either a positive sign of resilience or a negative sign of a downward trend, depending on the context of the 'key levels' (support or resistance). The inflation data (PCE index) is mildly inflationary, which could be slightly negative for the market in the short term due to potential interest rate hikes.  The majority of previous models lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, citing the negative market sentiment and Apple breaking key levels as the primary drivers.  While the 'breaking key levels' is ambiguous, the weight of evidence from the overall market downturn and the consensus of previous models points towards a higher likelihood of a price drop. I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly from the consensus to reflect the ambiguity of the 'breaking key levels' information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, which typically suggests a negative short-term trend. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge (PCE index) rising could add to market volatility, though its direct impact on Apple is less clear. While some models suggest Apple's resilience (e.g., breaking key levels could imply strong performance), the majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the broader market downturn and negative sentiment. Given the mixed signals but stronger weight on negative factors, the probability of a fall is slightly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order. Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, which typically implies a negative short-term trend for the stock. The inflation data, as measured by the PCE index, shows a rise but is not drastically high. Considering these factors, the negative aspects such as the tariff order and Apple's broken key levels seem to outweigh the neutral inflation data. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. However, the presence of some models predicting a rise, citing resilience in Apple and Nvidia, suggests that there is still some uncertainty and potential for positive performance. Given this mixed context, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on a Trump tariff order, and mentions that Apple (AAPL) has broken key levels. However, the overall predictions from other models are mixed, with some indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling and others suggesting a slightly higher probability of it rising. Considering the negative impact of the tariff order and the breaking of key levels, but also taking into account the resilience of Apple and Nvidia in the face of broader market decline, I estimate the probabilities to be closer to a neutral outlook but slightly leaning towards a fall due to the prevailing negative market sentiment and the specific mention of Apple breaking key levels.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news mentions multiple factors affecting the market, including Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order, which suggests a bearish market sentiment. Despite this, the news also states that Apple broke key levels, indicating strong performance for the company. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge increased slightly, which could be seen as a sign of economic growth but might also lead to concerns over interest rate hikes. Taking into account the mixed signals and previous predictions, there is a moderate expectation that Apple could perform well, but there is still uncertainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment in the broader market due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order, which typically negatively impacts investor sentiment. However, Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting some resilience or positive momentum. The inflation data shows a slight increase, which could lead to concerns about interest rates but is not drastically high. Given the mixed signals, with the overall market pressure weighing heavily, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall, but the positive performance of Apple could mitigate this to some extent.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The Dow Jones' decline due to tariffs is a negative market signal, and the mention of Apple 'breaking key levels' is ambiguous without knowing if these were support or resistance levels. The inflation data adds another layer of complexity. Previous models show a trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to the negative market sentiment and the 'breaking key levels' information. However, some models also acknowledge Apple's potential resilience. Considering the slightly more negative sentiment in the previous round, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price fall, but not as drastically as some of the earlier predictions, acknowledging the mixed signals and the potential for Apple to outperform the market despite the headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture. The Dow Jones' dive due to Trump's tariff order creates a broadly negative market sentiment, likely pressuring Apple's stock.  However, Apple's breaking of key levels is ambiguous; it could signal either resilience or a downward trend depending on whether these levels were support or resistance. The slightly increased PCE index adds further complexity, potentially hinting at future interest rate hikes and market volatility.  The majority of previous model predictions lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, emphasizing the negative market sentiment and Apple breaking key levels.  However, some models highlight Apple's and Nvidia's resilience as a counterpoint.  Considering the ambiguity of 'breaking key levels' and the overall negative market sentiment, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the potential for a positive outcome given Apple's apparent resilience in the face of broader market decline.  The shift in predictions across rounds shows a slight decrease in the predicted probability of a rise, reflecting the weight of the negative market news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment with the Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order, which generally pressures stocks. Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, which could imply a negative short-term trend. The inflation data (PCE index) shows a rise, adding to concerns about potential interest rate hikes. While some models suggest resilience in Apple's performance, the majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the broader market downturn and negative sentiment. Given the mixed signals but stronger weight on negative factors, the probability of a fall is slightly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order.

The Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order suggests a negative market sentiment, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, which could be interpreted as either a positive sign of resilience or a negative sign of a downward trend. The inflation data, as measured by the PCE index, shows a rise but is not drastically high. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative market sentiment and the specific mention of Apple breaking key levels.

Given the mixed context and the weight of evidence from previous models, I estimate the probabilities to be closer to a neutral outlook but slightly leaning towards a fall due to the prevailing negative market sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader market decline driven by Trump's tariff order, which negatively impacts investor sentiment. Apple is highlighted as breaking key levels, which can be interpreted both positively (indicating potential for recovery) and negatively (suggesting a continuation of a downtrend). The slight increase in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge (PCE index) adds a layer of complexity but does not significantly alter the overall market sentiment. Given the consistent predictions from previous rounds, there is a higher consensus on a negative outlook for Apple's stock price. However, there is also recognition of Apple's resilience compared to the broader market, which provides some support for a moderately positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment in the broader market due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order, which typically negatively impacts investor sentiment.

The Dow Jones' decline due to Trump's tariff order creates a broadly negative market sentiment, likely pressuring Apple's stock. Apple breaking key levels is ambiguous; it could signal either resilience or a downward trend depending on whether these levels were support or resistance.

The Dow Jones' dive due to Trump's tariff order creates a broadly negative market sentiment, which is likely to pressure Apple's stock. The statement that Apple 'broke key levels' is ambiguous without further context; it could indicate either a positive sign of resilience or a negative sign of a downward trend.
