      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\nNews Content: The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption and expenditures index, rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a broader market concern with the Dow Jones diving due to external factors like Trump's tariff order, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple and Nvidia are mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting some resilience or positive momentum in their stocks. The inflation data could also influence market dynamics, but the immediate impact on Apple is less clear. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive performance of Apple and Nvidia despite the overall market decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates negative pressure on the Dow Jones due to Trump's tariff order. It also mentions Apple breaking key levels, which usually implies a downward trend. While the article mentions MicroStrategy's move, its direct impact on Apple is unclear from this snippet. The inflation data (PCE index) is a mixed bag; while it shows inflation is present, it's not drastically high, so its impact is likely neutral to slightly negative as it reinforces the Fed's cautious stance. Overall, the negative aspects (tariffs, breaking key levels) outweigh the neutral/slightly negative inflation data, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple broke a key level, suggesting a negative short-term trend.  The broader market context is also negative, with the Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order. While the inflation data (PCE index) is relevant to the overall economy and could impact Apple indirectly, the headline's focus is on the immediate negative impact of the tariff order and Apple's price action.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following this news.  However, it's important to note that this is a short-term prediction based on limited information and doesn't account for long-term factors or other news that may emerge.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on a Trump tariff order, and mentions that Apple (AAPL) has broken key levels. Additionally, the PCE index rising suggests inflationary pressures, which could lead to concerns about higher interest rates. These factors combined are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that the Dow Jones dives on Trump's tariff order and that Apple (AAPL) breaks key levels. This suggests a negative impact on the stock market and specifically on Apple. Additionally, the content mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge rising, which could imply potential interest rate changes and further market volatility. Given this context, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news mentions that the Dow Jones dives due to Trump's tariff order and Apple breaks key levels, which could indicate a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the news also mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge rose, which could have a mixed effect on the stock market. Considering the direct mention of Apple breaking key levels in a negative context, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that the Dow Jones is diving due to Trump's tariff order, which suggests a bearish market sentiment. However, the article also states that Apple and Nvidia broke key levels, indicating strong performance for these companies despite broader market pressures. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge increased slightly, which could be seen as a sign of economic growth but might also lead to concerns over interest rate hikes. Given these factors, there is a moderate expectation that Apple could outperform the market, but there is still uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The Dow Jones' dive due to Trump's tariff order suggests a negative market sentiment, which would likely pressure Apple's stock.  However, the news also highlights Apple breaking key levels, which could be interpreted as either a positive sign of resilience or a negative sign of a downward trend, depending on the context of the 'key levels' (support or resistance). The inflation data (PCE index) is mildly inflationary, which could be slightly negative for the market in the short term due to potential interest rate hikes.  The majority of previous models lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, citing the negative market sentiment and Apple breaking key levels as the primary drivers.  While the 'breaking key levels' is ambiguous, the weight of evidence from the overall market downturn and the consensus of previous models points towards a higher likelihood of a price drop. I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly from the consensus to reflect the ambiguity of the 'breaking key levels' information.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```\n"
