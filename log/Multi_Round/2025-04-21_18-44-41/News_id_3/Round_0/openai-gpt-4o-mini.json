Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive performance of Apple and Nvidia despite the overall market decline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
