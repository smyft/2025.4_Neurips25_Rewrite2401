A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks are mixed, which suggests a lack of strong momentum in either direction for the sector. Given that Apple Inc. is a major player in the tech sector, its stock may be influenced by the overall market sentiment. However, without any specific positive or negative news directly related to Apple, the probabilities of significant movement are relatively balanced. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the general resilience of Apple as a company, but the mixed sector performance suggests caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector during late Friday afternoon trading. This suggests a neutral overall sentiment. Without access to the full article, it's impossible to determine the specific factors influencing the mixed performance or Apple's individual performance within the sector. Therefore, a slight bias towards a neutral outcome is assumed, with a slightly higher probability of a fall due to general market uncertainty implied by the 'mixed' performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline states that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading.  This is very general and provides no specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. The lack of specific information regarding Apple prevents a meaningful prediction of its stock price movement based solely on this headline.  The headline only indicates sector-wide indecision, not a directional force for any particular company within that sector. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned assuming a neutral market reaction to this non-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading, with no specific mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) performing exceptionally well or poorly. Given the lack of specific information about AAPL's performance, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement would align with the broader sector trend, which is mixed. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are roughly balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks are mixed, which suggests that there is no strong positive or negative trend in the tech sector. Since the news does not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is difficult to determine the impact on the company's stock price. However, given that the tech sector is mixed, it is likely that the stock price of AAPL will not be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated to be around 50% each.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
