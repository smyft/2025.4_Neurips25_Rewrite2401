A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks are mixed, which suggests a lack of strong momentum in either direction for the sector. Given that Apple Inc. is a major player in the tech sector, its stock may be influenced by the overall market sentiment. However, without any specific positive or negative news directly related to Apple, the probabilities of significant movement are relatively balanced. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the general resilience of Apple as a company, but the mixed sector performance suggests caution.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector during late Friday afternoon trading. This suggests a neutral overall sentiment. Without access to the full article, it's impossible to determine the specific factors influencing the mixed performance or Apple's individual performance within the sector. Therefore, a slight bias towards a neutral outcome is assumed, with a slightly higher probability of a fall due to general market uncertainty implied by the 'mixed' performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline states that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading.  This is very general and provides no specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. The lack of specific information regarding Apple prevents a meaningful prediction of its stock price movement based solely on this headline.  The headline only indicates sector-wide indecision, not a directional force for any particular company within that sector. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned assuming a neutral market reaction to this non-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading, with no specific mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) performing exceptionally well or poorly. Given the lack of specific information about AAPL's performance, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement would align with the broader sector trend, which is mixed. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are roughly balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks are mixed, which suggests that there is no strong positive or negative trend in the tech sector. Since the news does not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is difficult to determine the impact on the company's stock price. However, given that the tech sector is mixed, it is likely that the stock price of AAPL will not be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated to be around 50% each.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks are mixed, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction for the sector. Given that Apple Inc. is a significant player in the tech sector, its stock is likely influenced by overall market sentiment. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning slightly towards a rise and others towards a fall. However, the general consensus reflects uncertainty in the market. Therefore, I estimate a balanced probability of movement, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to Apple's historical resilience and strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector. This suggests a lack of clear direction for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tendency towards a neutral outlook. However, the initial predictions were quite varied, with some leaning slightly towards a rise and others towards a fall. Given the lack of specific information about Apple and the mixed sector performance, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly more neutral stance, but still acknowledging the inherent volatility and potential for a slight downward trend due to market uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline is very general, stating that tech stocks were mixed.  This provides no specific information about Apple's performance.  The previous predictions reflect this lack of specific information, with most models assigning roughly equal probabilities to a price rise and fall.  The absence of specific positive or negative news related to Apple makes it highly unlikely that the stock price will experience significant movement based solely on this headline.  While Apple's general resilience might suggest a slightly higher probability of a price rise, the overall market sentiment indicated by the 'mixed' sector performance neutralizes this effect.  Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50/50, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector, with no specific mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the lack of specific information about AAPL's performance and the general mixed sentiment in the sector, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are roughly balanced. Previous predictions also reflect this neutrality, with most models assigning equal or near-equal probabilities to both outcomes. Therefore, it is reasonable to maintain a neutral stance on AAPL's stock price movement based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, its stock performance may reflect this mixed trend. Without specific information about Apple's performance or outlook, it's reasonable to assume a neutral stance. The mixed performance of the tech sector suggests a lack of strong momentum in either direction, which implies that the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, considering Apple's general resilience and influence in the tech sector, there's a slight bias towards a positive movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading, which suggests a neutral overall sentiment. Without access to the full article, it's impossible to determine the specific factors influencing the mixed performance or Apple's individual performance within the sector. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions, but most models assign a roughly balanced probability to the stock price rising or falling. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's performance and the mixed sector performance, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the general resilience of Apple as a company, but the mixed sector performance suggests caution.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that tech stocks are mixed, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction for the sector. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, its stock could be influenced by the overall market sentiment. However, the lack of specific news related directly to Apple means that the probabilities of significant movement are relatively balanced. Previous predictions from various models suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment, with some models assigning equal probabilities for rise and fall, and others leaning slightly towards a fall. Considering all these factors, I estimate a balanced probability of stock price movement.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks are mixed, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction for the sector. Given that Apple Inc. is a significant player in the tech sector, its stock is likely influenced by overall market sentiment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning slightly towards a rise and others towards a fall. However, the general consensus reflects uncertainty in the market. Therefore, I estimate a balanced probability of movement, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to Apple's historical resilience and strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector, offering no specific information about Apple's performance. Previous predictions largely reflect this uncertainty, hovering around a 50/50 split. While Apple's inherent strength might suggest a slight upward bias, the 'mixed' sector performance tempers this. Given the lack of new information and the consistent neutral sentiment across previous rounds, I'll maintain a balanced probability, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's general resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline is vague, stating only that tech stocks were mixed.  This provides no specific information about Apple's performance.  The lack of specific news about Apple makes it highly unlikely that the stock price will experience significant movement based solely on this headline.  The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, mostly clustering around 0.5 for both rise and fall, reflecting the uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, reflecting Apple's general resilience.  However, the overall market sentiment indicated by the 'mixed' sector performance suggests caution. Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities close to 50/50, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the news, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's historical strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector, with no specific mention of Apple Inc.

Apple's general resilience and strong market position might suggest a slight bias towards a positive movement, but the mixed sector performance neutralizes this effect. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to be very close to 50/50, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading, with no specific mention of Apple Inc.

Previous predictions from various models reflect a range of sentiments, with most models assigning roughly balanced probabilities for a rise or fall in stock prices. The lack of specific positive or negative news directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) further supports a neutral market sentiment. Considering the general resilience of Apple and the mixed sector performance, there is a slight bias towards a positive movement, but overall the probabilities remain relatively balanced.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks are mixed, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction for the sector.
