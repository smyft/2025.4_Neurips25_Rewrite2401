(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's stock price, attributed to a downgrade by Jefferies analysts and concerns over weak iPhone sales. The downgrade to 'Underperform' and expectations of missed fiscal results suggest negative sentiment around Apple's future performance. Additionally, the competition from Nvidia, which has seen its stock rise, further emphasizes the challenges Apple is facing. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is high, while the probability of it rising is low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization is a symbolic blow. More importantly, the Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" citing weak iPhone 17/18 sales expectations and concerns about iPhone SE 4 demand are significant negative catalysts. The analysts' concerns about limited hardware upgrades, competition from used iPhones, and declining iPhone shipments, especially in China, further reinforce the bearish outlook. While Apple Intelligence is mentioned, its lack of traction with consumers is highlighted as a weakness. The overall sentiment is that Apple faces challenges in driving future iPhone sales, which is a major driver of its revenue. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article highlights a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales expectations, particularly for the iPhone 17, 18, and the upcoming SE 4.  The analysts point to limited hardware upgrades, weak demand in China, and the attractiveness of used iPhones as factors contributing to this weakness.  The current market reaction, with Apple's stock falling almost 4% and Nvidia surpassing it in market capitalization, further supports this negative outlook. While there's always potential for a rebound, the confluence of negative factors presented in the Jefferies report suggests a higher probability of further price decline in the short term.  The lack of positive news or counterarguments in the article reinforces this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform' due to expected misses in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, weak projected sales for iPhone 17 and 18, and cautious demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4. Additionally, iPhone shipments have declined year over year, with significant drops in China, leading to reduced shipment growth expectations. These factors collectively suggest bearish sentiment and potential downward pressure on Apple's stock price in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price has slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable company. The article mentions that Apple's shares fell by almost 4% and are down by more than 9% so far this year. Additionally, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform', citing expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. This negative sentiment and the recent stock price drop suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling further.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's shares have slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable public company.
