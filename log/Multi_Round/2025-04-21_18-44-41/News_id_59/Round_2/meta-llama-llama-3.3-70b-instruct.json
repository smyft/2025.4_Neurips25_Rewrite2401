(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sends 2 big signals that shatter tech investor assumptions: Snowflake CEO\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nDeepSeek has caused a permanent reset in how AI development will unfold in coming years.\n\nAt least that's the take from Snowflake (SNOW) CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose data storage company provides technology used by companies developing large language models like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n\n\"So what this [news] basically does is two things. One, it says there's still a lot of innovation left and many companies can aspire to train these models. But, two, it also raises the really interesting question of do you need to spend billions of dollars in order to train cutting-edge, world-class models? I think the jury is still out there for things like that, but it's basically upended our assumptions about where AI is going,\" Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese company that has burst onto the tech landscape seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nLast week, it surprised more than just markets after unveiling RI, its AI model that gave a ChatGPT-esque performance at an arguably cheaper price tag. RI costs a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nWatch: Why billionaire investor Ray Dalio is concerned about tech valuations\n\nFears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) chips.\n\nIn response, stocks went haywire on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s market value dropped by $588.8 billion, or 16.97%. It was the biggest ever single-day loss in a stock\u2019s market cap in absolute terms, according to Deutsche Bank data. Monday's decline for Nvidia was larger than the total market cap of Exxon or Mastercard.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia has persisted into Wednesday, with shares down 4.5%. The AI darling has seen its stock tank 11% so far this year.\n\n\"DeepSeek model suggests the cost of training GenAI models is set to decline substantially \u2026 which we see leading to faster gen-AI product innovation and availability,\" Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak said in a note.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nDeepSeek just revealed a huge risk to the stock market Billionaire Ray Dalio offers fresh tips on how to be a better investor Another bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini\n\nNowak stayed upbeat on Microsoft (MSFT) despite its investment exposure to OpenAI.\n\nInterestingly, Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on the Magnificent Seven names.\n\n\"Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers), as Apple is currently focused on smaller, function-specific, on-device LLM's, rather than large frontier models. As a result, Apple's annual capex ($9.4B in FY24) is about 1/20th the scale of the US Tier 1 hyperscalers combined, and therefore if the market hyper-focuses on capex ROI, the threshold for Apple to deliver an attractive return is far lower (i.e. less risk) than the T1 hyperscalers,\" explained Nowak.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy thinks investors need to be on high alert for more developments out of DeepSeek rivals in China.\n\n\"Even the fact that they were able to do this coming out of nowhere is a wake-up call again, that there's lots of innovation to go and many people should be trying it,\" said Ramaswamy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant shift in the AI landscape due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which raises concerns about the spending habits of major US tech companies, including Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's AI strategy is less risky and more contained compared to its peers, which could position it favorably amidst the turmoil. Given the mixed signals from the market, with some analysts remaining optimistic about Apple's prospects, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact the entire tech sector, including Apple, by increasing competition and potentially devaluing existing AI investments. However, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple's more contained AI ambitions, focusing on smaller, on-device LLMs, make it less vulnerable to the capex ROI concerns impacting other tech giants. This 'less risk' narrative could attract investors seeking safer bets within the tech sector. The overall market sentiment towards AI and tech stocks is currently volatile, as evidenced by Nvidia's significant market cap loss. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news, as investors may see it as a relatively safer haven compared to companies heavily invested in large-scale AI models. However, the overall market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sector downturn limit the upside potential.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, whose cheaper AI model has caused a significant drop in Nvidia's stock price due to concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure by US companies.  Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, however, believes Apple (AAPL) could benefit from this shift.  His reasoning is that Apple's AI strategy is focused on smaller, on-device models, requiring significantly less capital expenditure compared to large-scale models developed by other tech giants. This lower capex makes Apple less vulnerable to the concerns raised by DeepSeek's success.  Therefore, the news presents a positive outlook for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights DeepSeek's impact on the AI industry, suggesting that the cost of training AI models may decline significantly, which could disrupt current assumptions about AI development costs. This has already led to a sell-off in Nvidia, a key player in AI infrastructure. However, Apple (AAPL) is seen as less exposed to these risks due to its focus on smaller, function-specific AI models rather than large frontier models. Morgan Stanley's analyst suggests that Apple's lower capex and different AI strategy position it favorably compared to other tech giants. Given this, the news may be neutral to slightly positive for Apple, as it is not directly threatened by DeepSeek's advancements and could benefit from reduced market focus on high-capex AI players.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's AI model performance and cost-effective approach has caused a stir in the tech industry, particularly affecting companies involved in AI development like Nvidia (NVDA) and potentially impacting Apple (AAPL) and other major players. The CEO of Snowflake suggests that DeepSeek's emergence may signal a shift in how AI models are developed and priced. While Nvidia suffered a significant drop due to fears of overspending on AI infrastructure, Apple's stock might be viewed more favorably as its AI ambitions are more contained and less capital-intensive. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak believes Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific on-device LLM's (Large Language Models) could make it a winner as it implies less risk and lower capital expenditure requirements compared to training large frontier models.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the tech industry, particularly on companies like Nvidia and Apple. According to Snowflake's CEO, DeepSeek has caused a permanent reset in how AI development will unfold, and this has raised questions about the need for massive investments in AI infrastructure. The article also mentions that Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on other tech companies. Nowak notes that Apple's AI ambitions are more contained, and its annual capex is significantly lower than that of other hyperscalers, making it less risky. Based on this analysis, it seems that the news is more positive for Apple than negative, which suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. Snowflake CEO suggests that this could challenge assumptions about the cost and feasibility of AI innovation. The news indicates that Nvidia's stock has been significantly affected, dropping 16.97%, reflecting investor concerns. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak remains bullish on Apple, suggesting that Apple's smaller-scale AI efforts may be less risky for investors. This could potentially lead to an increased interest in Apple's stock, assuming investors start favoring companies with more controlled AI spending.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant shift in the AI landscape due to DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which raises concerns about the spending habits of major US tech companies, including Apple. However, analysts suggest that Apple's AI strategy is less risky and more contained compared to its peers, which could position it favorably amidst the turmoil. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak believes that Apple's focus on smaller, function-specific AI models makes it less vulnerable to the capex ROI concerns impacting other tech giants. Given the mixed signals from the market, with some analysts remaining optimistic about Apple's prospects, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is that the news is slightly positive for Apple. DeepSeek's emergence and its impact on AI infrastructure spending have negatively affected companies like Nvidia. However, Apple's more contained AI strategy, focusing on on-device models with lower capital expenditure, is seen as a potential advantage. Morgan Stanley's analyst's positive outlook on Apple further supports this view. While the overall market sentiment towards tech stocks remains volatile, Apple is perceived as a safer bet in this context. Considering the consistent positive leaning in previous predictions, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The emergence of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model creates uncertainty in the tech sector, potentially impacting investor sentiment negatively.  However, analysts highlight Apple's more contained AI strategy, focusing on smaller, on-device models, as a key differentiator. This less capital-intensive approach makes Apple less vulnerable to the concerns surrounding high capex in AI development, as seen with Nvidia's significant stock drop.  The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, primarily due to Apple's perceived lower risk profile compared to other tech giants heavily invested in large-scale AI models.  While the overall market uncertainty remains, Apple's position as a relatively safer bet in the current volatile AI landscape contributes to the higher probability of a price increase.  However, the potential for a broader tech sector downturn cannot be entirely discounted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights DeepSeek's disruptive impact on the AI industry, particularly its cost-effective AI model that challenges the high spending of US tech companies like Nvidia. This has led to significant market volatility, with Nvidia's stock plummeting. However, Apple (AAPL) is positioned differently, as its AI strategy focuses on smaller, on-device models with lower capital expenditure, making it less vulnerable to the concerns raised by DeepSeek. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak suggests Apple could benefit as investors seek safer bets in the tech sector. Given this, while the broader tech sector faces uncertainty, Apple's unique positioning and lower risk profile suggest a higher probability of its stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model has caused significant concern in the tech industry, particularly affecting companies like Nvidia.
