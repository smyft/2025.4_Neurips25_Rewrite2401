(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition\nNews Content: By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing challenges due to delays in AI features and increased competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, which is expected to negatively impact iPhone demand. Analysts predict lower revenue growth compared to previous quarters, and the strengthening U.S. dollar may further complicate sales abroad. Given these factors, the overall sentiment is bearish, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple. Key concerns include: 1) Lagging behind in AI integration compared to competitors like Google and Samsung, potentially impacting iPhone sales. 2) Loss of market share in the crucial Chinese market due to competition from Huawei and other domestic brands. 3) Weaker than expected iPhone sales growth projections. 4) Negative impact from a stronger US dollar on international sales. While the services business is expected to grow, the overall tone suggests downward pressure on the stock. The fact that the stock has already fallen 5% in January indicates existing investor concerns. The tepid revenue growth forecast further reinforces this negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the slower-than-expected revenue growth (3.8% vs. expected 6.1%) and lagging AI features compared to competitors are significant negatives, potentially impacting iPhone sales and market share, particularly in China, there are some mitigating factors.  The services sector continues to show strong growth (12.9%), suggesting resilience in other areas of the business.  The impact of the stronger dollar is a concern, but it's a macroeconomic factor affecting many companies, not unique to Apple.  The market has already priced in some negative sentiment, as evidenced by the 5% drop in January.  Therefore, while the negative news is substantial, the probability of a significant further drop is lessened by the already-reflected market sentiment and the continued strength in the services sector.  A price rise is less likely given the current headwinds, but a complete collapse is also unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including slower AI feature roll-outs, increased competition in China, and a decline in market share. The delayed AI features and criticism over an inaccurate AI tool may weaken investor confidence. Additionally, the stronger U.S. dollar could negatively impact international sales. Analysts expect tepid revenue growth and weaker iPhone sales, which are key drivers of Apple's revenue. These factors collectively suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges faced by Apple Inc., including delays in the rollout of artificial intelligence features, tough competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a decline in market share. Specifically, Apple's iPhone 16 series lacked AI features at launch, and some AI services are expected later this year in limited regions. The company faces resurgent competition from Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers, leading to a decline in Apple's global smartphone market share from 25% to 23% and a steeper decline in China. Analysts expect tepid quarterly revenue growth of 3.8%, with iPhone sales likely to tick up only 1.9%. These factors are likely to negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the services business is expected to post a 12.9% increase in sales, which could provide some positive offset. Given the overall negative tone of the article and the expected weak performance in key product lines, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's shares have already fallen 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Based on this information, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights several challenges for Apple Inc., including delays in AI feature roll-out, increased competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, and a decline in global market share. These factors are expected to negatively impact their revenue growth, particularly in critical markets like China. While the services business is expected to show growth, the overall sentiment is pessimistic, leading to a decline in Apple's share price in January.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
