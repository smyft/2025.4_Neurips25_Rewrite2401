(AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Additionally, Bernstein's price target increase from $240 to $260 suggests a bullish outlook. However, concerns about the IT hardware sector and volatility in Apple's stock could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsements and strong financial performance indicate a higher likelihood of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple's inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, suggesting confidence in the company's financial stability and dividend potential. Bernstein raised its price target, indicating a positive outlook. Apple's strong Q4 2024 revenue and shareholder distributions are also positive signals. However, the article also mentions that Bernstein views IT hardware as a \"structurally challenged sector\" and that stock valuations are high. The article also mentions that Madison Investments is underweight on Apple. The article also suggests that other AI stocks may have higher returns in a shorter time frame. Overall, the news is mildly positive, but the potential for higher returns in other AI stocks and the high valuation of Apple stock temper the positive sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, placing it 4th on the list.  While this is positive sentiment, the article also highlights O'Leary's focus on dividend-paying companies and his preference for AI stocks with potentially higher returns.  The article mentions Bernstein's positive outlook and Apple's strong Q4 2024 results, but also notes that Madison Investments is underweight on Apple.  The overall tone is mixed; while Apple is recognized as a strong company, the article suggests other investments might offer greater potential.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high due to the counterbalancing factors and the lack of a strong endorsement from O'Leary.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025, highlighting its inclusion in his portfolio due to its strong financial performance, solid balance sheet, and consistent dividend growth. The article also mentions Bernstein raising its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintaining an Outperform rating, indicating positive analyst sentiment. Additionally, Apple reported a 6% increase in revenue for Q4 2024 and distributed $29 billion to shareholders, reinforcing its financial stability. However, the article notes that Apple's stock has been volatile and that some investors believe AI stocks may offer higher returns. Overall, the news is largely positive, with strong fundamentals and analyst support, but there is some caution due to market volatility and competition from AI stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and mentions that Bernstein raised its price target for Apple from $240 to $260 with an Outperform rating. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance and its position in the market are highlighted. However, the article also mentions that Madison Investments expressed a slightly cautious view on Apple due to its volatility and current underweight position. Despite this, the overall sentiment seems positive, with Apple's strong financials, extensive product platform, and recent AI strategy introduction creating potential for growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, given the positive ratings and forecasts from influential analysts and investors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While O'Leary's investment strategy focuses on quality companies with strong financial performance, diverse portfolios, and dividend-paying stocks, the article does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of his top picks. However, AAPL is mentioned as a well-established company with a strong balance sheet and a history of consistent dividend growth. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing a favorable environment for IT spending in 2025. Additionally, AAPL reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Considering these positive factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, indicating a positive sentiment towards the company. Additionally, the company reported strong revenue growth and continued investor interest from hedge funds. However, the news also mentions potential challenges like the volatile nature of Apple's stock and the emphasis on AI stocks with potentially higher returns. The overall positive outlook from Kevin O'Leary and the company's strong fundamentals suggest a likelihood of stock price rise, albeit with some caution.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The mention of Madison Investments being underweight on Apple and the overall characterization of the IT hardware sector as 'structurally challenged' introduce bearish sentiment.
