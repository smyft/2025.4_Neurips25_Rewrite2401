(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: Jan. 30 will be a massive day for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock, as that's when the company reports results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ending around Dec. 31). This is a huge deal, as it includes the all-important holiday quarter, which could make or break Apple's stock.\n\nApple needs to change the narrative around its stock, as the company has delivered fairly stagnant growth over the past few years. The news could mark a huge shift in sentiment for Apple stock, and it needs a strong report to maintain the status quo.\n\nApple needs to kickstart its revenue growth this year\n\nApple is one of the most recognizable consumer electronics brands around the globe. It has built a powerhouse on an ecosystem that connects flawlessly with each other devices and successfully captured the most important audience for any company: young consumers.\n\nThis drove significant growth for many years, but since 2022, its revenue hasn't really grown.AAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThat's years of stagnant revenue, which isn't a great sign for a business. However, Apple is one of the best companies in the world, so that hasn't stopped it from growing its earnings through a combination of share buybacks and improving profitability. Still, there is only so much juice to squeeze when making a company more efficient, and Apple may be nearing its limit.AAPL Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThis leaves share buybacks as the primary way to grow earnings, but the effect of these repurchases may start to diminish. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28), Apple spent $25 billion on buybacks. But that occurred during a time when Apple was valued at near its highest point in five years.AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nThis makes the share repurchases less effective because the company has to pay a higher price to repurchase its own stock. This reduces the program's effect on earnings-per-share (EPS) growth.\n\nSo, with two of Apple's primary ways to grow earnings potentially running out of steam, the conversation circles back to revenue growth, which Apple has struggled with over the past few years.\n\nExpectations for Q1 aren't high\n\nFiscal Q1 encompasses the holiday quarter, and it will be a key moment for Apple to see if its iPhones and Apple Intelligence made a difference for consumers. Apple is seeing rising competition from Android phone makers, and this may weigh on Apple's results.\n\nWall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, as they project 3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth. Investors may be highly critical of Apple even if it posts results that everyone expects.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo, should investors buy Apple stock before Jan. 30? I'd say no.\n\nThere isn't much optimism about Apple's business right now, and even if it reports a blowout quarter, the expectations are so high that Apple's stock likely won't budge. It trades for 32 times forward earnings right now, which is normally a level reserved for a company growing earnings and revenue at least in the mid-teens range.\n\nApple isn't anywhere close to that, so there's a lot of risk and not a ton of reward left in the stock. There are many cheaper alternatives with better growth than Apple, and investors should invest their money in those before buying Apple shares.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing stagnant growth and high expectations for its upcoming earnings report. Analysts project modest sales and EPS growth, and there is skepticism about whether a strong report will significantly impact the stock price. Given the high valuation and lack of optimism, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a bearish outlook on Apple's stock leading up to the earnings report on January 30th. It highlights stagnant revenue growth, concerns about the effectiveness of share buybacks, and rising competition. The author explicitly advises against buying the stock before the report, citing high expectations and a rich valuation. While a positive earnings surprise could theoretically boost the stock, the article suggests that even a 'blowout' quarter might not be enough to significantly move the price due to already high expectations. The overall tone is negative, emphasizing risk over reward. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article expresses a pessimistic outlook on Apple's short-term stock performance.  While the upcoming Q1 earnings report is crucial, the author believes that even a positive report is unlikely to significantly boost the stock price due to already high expectations and a relatively high P/E ratio.  The article highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, diminishing returns from share buybacks, and increasing competition.  The author's recommendation is to avoid buying Apple stock before the earnings announcement.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is considered low, while the probability of a price decrease or stagnation is considered higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's stagnant revenue growth and high valuation, with analysts not expecting significant growth in the upcoming earnings report. The article suggests that even a strong report may not positively impact the stock due to high expectations and current valuation. The lack of optimism and potential criticism from investors if results meet expectations suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings report on January 30, highlighting the importance of this event for the company's stock. Apple has experienced stagnant growth over the past few years, and the current low expectations from Wall Street analysts (3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth) suggest that even a meeting of these expectations might not significantly boost the stock price. The article concludes that buying Apple stock before January 30 is not recommended due to high valuation (32 times forward earnings) and limited growth prospects. Based on this analysis, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling or remaining stagnant rather than rising significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The article highlights the company's stagnant revenue growth over the past few years and the need for a strong report to change the narrative around its stock. However, the article also notes that Wall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, and even if it reports a blowout quarter, the expectations are so high that Apple's stock likely won't budge. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's stock trades for 32 times forward earnings, which is normally a level reserved for a company growing earnings and revenue at least in the mid-teens range, but Apple isn't anywhere close to that. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's struggle with stagnant revenue growth and low analyst expectations for the upcoming quarter. Despite being one of the most recognizable brands, recent performance suggests limited future growth potential. The market seems skeptical, and even a strong report might not move the stock significantly due to high valuations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
