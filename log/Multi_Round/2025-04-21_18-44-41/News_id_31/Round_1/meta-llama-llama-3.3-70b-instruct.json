      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Q1 Services Revenue Jump Helps It Beat Analyst Estimates\nNews Content: Apple reported robust fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, despite mixed performance in key segments.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results show strong performance in its services segment, which is a key growth area for the company. Beating analyst estimates typically signifies positive momentum and investor confidence. Despite some mixed performance in other segments, strong services revenue can offset potential concerns, leading to a higher probability of stock price appreciation. Overall, the favorable earnings report outweighs the mixed performance indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple beating analyst estimates is generally positive news, indicating strong performance and investor confidence. The increase in services revenue is a key driver, as this segment often has higher margins and is more predictable than hardware sales. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall message is positive due to the earnings beat, suggesting a likely positive investor reaction. Therefore, a rise in stock price is more probable than a fall. However, 'mention of mixed performance' can lead to a slight correction later on. Considering that these kinds of issues can be overlooked to go with the main sentiment, I give it a slightly higher probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple beat analyst estimates for Q1 2025, driven by strong Services revenue. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall beat is positive.  Generally, exceeding earnings expectations is viewed favorably by the market. However, the 'mixed performance' suggests there might be some countervailing factors that could limit upside.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the potential for a muted reaction or even slight dip due to the less-than-stellar performance in other segments. The overall positive sentiment from beating estimates should outweigh the negative, though.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings, driven by a strong performance in its Services segment. This positive earnings surprise typically leads to increased investor confidence and a higher likelihood of the stock price rising in the short term. While the mention of 'mixed performance in key segments' introduces some uncertainty, the overall tone of the news is positive. Historical market reactions to earnings beats suggest a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, driven by a significant jump in services revenue. This positive earnings report is likely to boost investor confidence. Historically, better-than-expected earnings have led to short-term stock price increases. However, the overall performance was mixed, which might temper excessive optimism. Given the strong services revenue growth and beating estimates, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 services revenue jumped, helping the company beat analyst estimates. This suggests a positive earnings report, which is likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price. Although the performance in key segments was mixed, the overall beat in estimates is a bullish signal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance of its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, as services revenue is a significant growth area for the company. Therefore, the general market reaction is expected to be favorable.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
