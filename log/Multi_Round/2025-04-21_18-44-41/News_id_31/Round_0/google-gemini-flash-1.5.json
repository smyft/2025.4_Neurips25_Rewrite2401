While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall beat is positive.  Generally, exceeding earnings expectations is viewed favorably by the market. However, the 'mixed performance' suggests there might be some countervailing factors that could limit upside.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the potential for a muted reaction or even slight dip due to the less-than-stellar performance in other segments. The overall positive sentiment from beating estimates should outweigh the negative, though.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Q1 Services Revenue Jump Helps It Beat Analyst Estimates\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```\n"
