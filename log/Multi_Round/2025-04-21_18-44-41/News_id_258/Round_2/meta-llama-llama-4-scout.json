The call? Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple, driven by emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The mention of a solid quarter and the anticipation surrounding the iPhone 17 and iPhone SE launch suggests that investor sentiment is likely to be optimistic. Although there are concerns about iPhone demand in China, the overall narrative indicates resilience and potential for market share gains due to competitors' supply issues. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Evercore ISI has placed Apple on its Tactical Outperform List with a $250 price target. The analysis points to solid quarterly performance driven by emerging market growth, stable Services and Wearables demand, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues. The focus is shifting towards the iPhone 17, which is rumored to have a major redesign, and the upcoming iPhone SE launch, both of which could sustain demand. While there are concerns about iPhone 16 discounts in China, overall demand appears stable due to emerging markets. The article suggests that expectations are already tempered, so Apple only needs to show resilience to keep the stock moving higher. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup implies more upside potential than downside risk. However, the GuruFocus warning signs should be considered a slight negative factor. Considering all these factors, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is largely positive for Apple. Evercore ISI's positive outlook and $250 price target, coupled with expectations of strong iPhone 17 demand and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's struggles, suggest a bullish sentiment.  While some concerns exist regarding iPhone weakness in China, the article frames this as a low bar to clear and highlights the offsetting effect of emerging market growth. The anticipation of the iPhone 17 redesign further fuels positive expectations.  However, the analysis acknowledges that the market already has tempered expectations, meaning a significant price surge is not guaranteed.  Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, the possibility of a fall or stagnation cannot be entirely ruled out due to inherent market volatility and the possibility of unforeseen negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights positive factors such as Apple being added to Evercore ISI's Tactical Outperform List, expected solid quarter performance driven by emerging market growth, stable demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and the upcoming iPhone SE launch are seen as catalysts for future demand. The $250 price target and steady gross margins further support a bullish outlook. However, some weakness in China and discounted iPhone 16 prices could pose minor risks. Overall, the positive factors outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on several factors: Evercore ISI's Tactical Outperform List inclusion, a solid quarter expectation driven by emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables, potential market share gain due to Huawei's chip supply issues, and anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch.

Additionally, Apple's ability to potentially gain market share due to Huawei's chip supply issues and the overall stable demand for iPhones, despite some discounts in China, contribute to a positive sentiment. The article concludes that the setup looks 'asymmetrically interesting' for investors looking for upside, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Evercore ISI has placed Apple on its Tactical Outperform List, projecting solid performance driven by emerging markets and steady demand for services and wearables. Despite concerns over iPhone sales in China, analysts view this as a minor issue given potential market share gain from Huawei's challenges. The focus shifts to the forthcoming iPhone 17, anticipated to have a major redesign, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch, potentially boosting demand. The current situation presents an asymmetric opportunity for investors looking for upside.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news presents a largely positive outlook for Apple, driven by Evercore ISI's inclusion of the company on its Tactical Outperform List and a $250 price target. The anticipated strong performance in emerging markets, stable demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains due to Huawei's supply issues contribute to a bullish sentiment. While there are concerns regarding iPhone demand in China, these are framed as manageable risks. The focus on the upcoming iPhone 17 redesign and the iPhone SE launch further supports expectations for future demand. Overall, the positive factors outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is strongly positive, with probabilities of a price rise consistently around 0.7 to 0.75. The news itself is also largely positive, highlighting Evercore ISI's bullish outlook, potential market share gains in China, and anticipation for the iPhone 17. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup further reinforces the upside potential. While the GuruFocus warning signs and some weakness in China are minor concerns, they don't outweigh the overall positive sentiment. Given the strong consensus and the positive news, I will slightly increase the probability of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple.  Evercore ISI's $250 price target and Tactical Outperform rating are strong bullish signals. The anticipation of the iPhone 17 redesign and the upcoming iPhone SE launch are significant catalysts for future growth. While concerns exist regarding China's market, the analysis suggests this is a low bar to clear, and potential market share gains from Huawei's struggles offset this risk.  Emerging market growth and steady demand for services and wearables further bolster the positive outlook.  The consensus among previous models (averaging around 0.7 probability of a price rise) supports this positive assessment.  However, the inherent volatility of the stock market and the possibility of unforeseen negative events mean a complete certainty of a price rise is unrealistic.  Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is high, a small probability of a fall is acknowledged.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely positive outlook for Apple Inc.
