(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban has created a temporary surge in demand for iPhones with the app installed, leading to inflated prices on eBay. This unusual market behavior may generate short-term interest in Apple products, potentially boosting sales and brand visibility. However, the long-term implications of the TikTok ban and its uncertain future could create volatility. Overall, the immediate impact seems positive for Apple, but the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's status may temper expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise due to the current frenzy, but with a significant chance of decline due to potential backlash or long-term effects of the ban.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity and user frustration, it's unlikely to have a significant, lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is presented as somewhat of a novelty. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't represent a fundamental shift in Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The news is more of a curiosity than a driver of significant financial impact for Apple. The advertisements within the article are also a distraction from the core news. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement, either up or down, is relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban and subsequent reinstatement of the app. While the high prices fetched on eBay for these phones highlight the strong user engagement with TikTok, this event is unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Apple's stock price.  The core business of Apple remains unaffected. The temporary nature of the situation, coupled with the fact that the issue is related to a third-party app and not Apple's products or services, suggests that the market reaction will be minimal.  Any price fluctuation would likely be short-lived and within the normal daily trading range. Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are close to equal, slightly favoring no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store. While this indicates strong consumer interest in TikTok, it does not directly impact Apple's core business metrics like revenue or earnings. The frenzy is more of a short-term, niche market phenomenon rather than a significant driver of Apple's stock price. Additionally, the uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility, but it is unlikely to have a material impact on Apple's long-term performance. Therefore, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, as it underscores the desirability of iPhones but does not translate into direct financial gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This has led to some iPhones being sold for thousands of dollars on eBay. However, this frenzy is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban is temporary, and TikTok's future in the U.S. is still uncertain but not directly related to Apple's core business performance. Apple's stock price is more likely to be influenced by its overall financial performance, product releases, and long-term growth strategy rather than a temporary surge in demand for used iPhones with a specific app.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the frenzy caused by the TikTok ban in the U.S., leading to a surge in demand for iPhones with the app pre-installed. While this may seem like a positive development for Apple, it's essential to consider the broader context. The ban is a result of a geopolitical dispute, and its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited. The article highlights the desperation of TikTok users, which may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales. However, this demand is unlikely to be sustainable, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the resolution of the TikTok ban, the company's overall sales performance, and the competitive landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones due to the installed TikTok app, which has led to increased prices on platforms like eBay. This indicates strong consumer interest and potentially higher sales volumes for Apple, positively impacting its stock price. However, there is also uncertainty regarding the future of TikTok, which might affect Apple's relationship with TikTok and could introduce regulatory risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
