Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as being significantly impacted by this development.  The article focuses on the potential overblown nature of Wall Street's concerns. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect. Any price movement would probably be driven by broader market sentiment rather than this specific news.  We assume a slightly higher probability of no change or a minor positive movement due to Apple's overall strong market position and resilience.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7.
