      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next.\nNews Content: News of a cheaper AI model exposes vulnerabilities for Nvidia, Amazon.com, Alphabet, and other hot-shot companies. Here\u2019s why Wall Street\u2019s concerns might be overblown.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a cheaper AI model that poses a threat to major tech companies, including Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet. While this could create concerns about competition and market share, the article suggests that Wall Street's fears may be exaggerated. Since Apple is not directly mentioned as being negatively impacted by this news, and given its strong market position and brand loyalty, the overall sentiment may not significantly affect AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the lack of direct negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model on other 'Mag 7' companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, suggesting potential competitive pressure and vulnerability. While the article claims Wall Street's concerns might be overblown, the initial impact is likely negative sentiment towards the affected companies. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Mag 7' group, so there is a chance that the news will affect the stock price. However, the article does not focus on Apple specifically, and the impact is likely to be less than on companies directly involved in AI model development. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, posing a potential threat to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.  Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article as being significantly impacted by this development.  The article focuses on the potential overblown nature of Wall Street's concerns. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect. Any price movement would probably be driven by broader market sentiment rather than this specific news.  We assume a slightly higher probability of no change or a minor positive movement due to Apple's overall strong market position and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that the introduction of a cheaper AI model by DeepSeek has exposed vulnerabilities in several major tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the headline implies potential negative impacts on these companies, the content also mentions that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown. This indicates a mixed sentiment. Apple's stock price could be affected by concerns over competition in the AI space, but the overblown nature of the concerns might mitigate the negative impact. Given Apple's strong market position and diversified product portfolio, the immediate negative impact might be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that DeepSeek, a cheaper AI model, may expose vulnerabilities for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, but does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the headline also mentions that the concerns might be overblown, which could imply a neutral or positive outlook for the tech industry as a whole. Given that AAPL is a part of the 'Mag 7' ( likely referring to the Magnificent Seven, a group of large-cap tech stocks including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and others), the lack of direct negative mention and the potential for overblown concerns could lead to a stable or positive outlook for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, and its potential impact on companies like Nvidia, Amazon.com, and Alphabet, but does not directly mention Apple Inc. as being affected. However, as a major technology company, any significant development in the AI space could indirectly influence Apple's stock price. The article suggests that Wall Street's concerns about the impact of this new AI model might be overblown, implying that the negative effects on the mentioned companies might be less severe than anticipated. Since Apple is not directly implicated in the vulnerabilities exposed by DeepSeek, and considering the general trend of technology companies being influenced by advancements and competitive shifts in the AI sector, the article's indirect implications for Apple are minimal. Thus, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling directly due to this news is relatively balanced, but given the lack of direct negative implications, there might be a slight leaning towards a neutral to positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a new AI model from a company called DeepSeek that could potentially expose vulnerabilities for major tech companies such as Nvidia, Amazon.com, Alphabet, etc. However, it also mentions that Wall Street's concerns may be overblown. Since Apple Inc. is not one of the mentioned companies, it suggests that the impact on Apple should be limited. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek that poses potential threats to major tech companies, particularly Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet. While Apple is part of the 'Mag 7' group, it is not directly mentioned as being negatively impacted. The article suggests that Wall Street's concerns may be overblown, which could imply a more stable outlook for Apple. Given Apple's strong market position and brand loyalty, the overall sentiment may not significantly affect AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the lack of direct negative impact on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on other 'Mag 7' companies, but the article suggests Wall Street's concerns might be overblown. Apple is part of the 'Mag 7', but not directly mentioned as being negatively impacted. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a slight rise and others towards a slight fall. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple and the article's suggestion that concerns are overblown, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not significantly, as the AI space is competitive and any development could indirectly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of a cheaper AI model on other tech giants, not directly on Apple. While Apple is part of the 'Mag 7', the article suggests Wall Street's concerns might be overblown.  The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising.  The lack of direct negative news about Apple, coupled with its strong market position and brand loyalty, suggests that the impact of this news on AAPL will be minimal.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the overall impact is likely to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, which poses potential threats to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, but does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article suggests that Wall Street's concerns about the impact of this new AI model might be overblown, implying that the negative effects on the mentioned companies might be less severe than anticipated. Given Apple's strong market position, diversified product portfolio, and lack of direct mention in the news, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed but leans slightly towards a neutral to positive outlook for AAPL. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the impact of a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, on major tech companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, but does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article suggests that Wall Street's concerns about the impact of this new AI model might be overblown. Given that Apple is not directly implicated in the vulnerabilities exposed by DeepSeek, and considering the general trend of technology companies being influenced by advancements and competitive shifts in the AI sector, the article's indirect implications for Apple are minimal. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling directly due to this news is relatively balanced, but given the lack of direct negative implications, there might be a slight leaning towards a neutral to positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, which may expose vulnerabilities for major tech companies such as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet. However, Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned as being significantly impacted by this development.

Considering the lack of direct negative implications for Apple and the general trend of technology companies being influenced by advancements and competitive shifts in the AI sector, the article's indirect implications for Apple are minimal. The predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price will be limited. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling directly due to this news is relatively balanced, but given the lack of direct negative implications, there might be a slight leaning towards a neutral to positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a cheaper AI model from a company called DeepSeek that could potentially expose vulnerabilities for major tech companies such as Nvidia, Amazon.com, Alphabet, etc. However, Apple Inc. is not one of the companies directly mentioned. The article suggests that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown, which implies that the impact on Apple should be limited. Although there is an indirect risk associated with increased competition in the AI space, Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong market position may mitigate the negative effects. The majority of previous predictions indicate a balanced view with a slight tendency towards a neutral to positive outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
