(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\nNews Content: Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sales outlook for Apple, with executives expecting sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the fiscal second quarter. This suggests demand momentum for the iPhone, despite a slight drop in iPhone sales and misses in the company's performance in Greater China. The overall reaction in premarket trading is positive, showing a rebound. Additionally, the mixed nature of the earnings report, with positive signs in services, the introduction of Apple Intelligence, and a cautious approach to AI investing, contributes to speculations about future growth. However, concerns regarding competition and regional sales particularly in China may temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive sales outlook and management's optimism lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeded expectations, driven by iPhone demand momentum, iPhone sales actually fell short of estimates, particularly in China. The growth in the services unit is a positive sign. The impact of Apple Intelligence is noted as beneficial but not yet fully realized due to limited availability. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed', with China concerns overshadowing positive areas. The initial pre-market reaction was a dip, followed by a rebound, suggesting investor uncertainty. Also a detail not to ignore, market turmoil affected other big tech companies, but Apple was relatively insulated. Overall, the positive outlook and Apple Intelligence are the main drivers for potential upside, while weak iPhone sales and China performance are the main downside risks, the market gives more importance to the overall sales outlook. Considering these factors, i think investors will focus more on the positive outlook than on some negative details that are affecting it.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report was mixed. While overall revenue and EPS beat expectations, iPhone sales slightly missed estimates, and sales in Greater China were significantly below projections.  However, the positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, exceeding analyst expectations, and the positive impact of Apple Intelligence (AI features) on iPhone sales are key factors influencing the prediction.  The cautious approach to AI also seems to have shielded Apple from the recent Big Tech downturn. The slightly negative aspects (missed iPhone sales targets and weak China performance) are outweighed by the positive Q2 guidance and the perceived success of Apple Intelligence.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple. While iPhone sales slightly missed estimates, the company's services unit showed strong growth, and the guidance for future sales surpassed expectations. The positive sales outlook and the potential benefits from Apple Intelligence in boosting future sales are likely to outweigh concerns about the dip in iPhone sales and weaker performance in Greater China. Additionally, Apple's cautious approach to AI has helped insulate its stock from recent market turmoil, which could be seen as a positive by investors. Given these factors, the stock is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's shares are rising due to a rosy sales outlook, suggesting momentum in iPhone demand. Despite a marginal drop in iPhone sales in the previous quarter, the company's guidance for the fiscal second quarter surpassed expectations, indicating growth in the low- to mid-single digits. The introduction of Apple Intelligence is also seen as a positive factor boosting sales. However, concerns around sales in Greater China, where Apple's sales dropped 11%, might temper some of the optimism. Overall, the positive outlook and better-than-expected guidance seem to outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports a positive sales outlook for Apple, with expected sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits in the fiscal second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations.

Although iPhone sales fell slightly in the previous quarter, the company's services unit showed a 14% year-on-year increase. The article also mentions that Apple's cautious approach to AI has helped insulate the stock from recent market turmoil. However, sales in Greater China were down 11%, which is a negative note. Overall, the positive outlook and strong services revenue outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook on Apple's sales, particularly the iPhone sales momentum, which has exceeded expectations despite a slight decline in the holiday quarter. The cautious approach towards AI and its potential benefits have also positively impacted investor sentiment.
