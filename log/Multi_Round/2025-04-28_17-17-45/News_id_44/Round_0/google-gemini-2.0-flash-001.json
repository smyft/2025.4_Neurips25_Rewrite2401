The market's reaction will depend heavily on whether Apple meets, beats, or misses expectations. Given the mixed performance of other tech giants (Tesla rising despite earnings miss, Microsoft's Azure disappointment, Meta's strong profit), the market sentiment appears sensitive. However, the report being after hours suggests the actual figures will drive the movement and it could go either way depending on the contents of the quarterly report. Presuming similar volatility to Tesla and Meta, there is more likelihood of a larger move up if the report turns out to be better than predicted than a move down if it disappoints.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
