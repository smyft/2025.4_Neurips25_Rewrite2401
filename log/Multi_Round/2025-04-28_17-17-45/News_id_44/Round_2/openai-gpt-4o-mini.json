      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\nNews Content: Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings miss analysts\u2019 estimates but the stock rises on optimism over the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s growth projections, Microsoft\u2019s Azure growth misses estimates, and Meta\u2019s fourth-quarter profit handily tops forecasts. Apple\u2019s quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, which creates uncertainty among investors. The mixed performance of other tech stocks in the news, such as Microsoft's misses alongside Meta's strong report, may lead to cautious sentiment towards Apple's results. Given that earnings reports can significantly influence stock prices based on meeting or exceeding analysts' expectations, the overall market sentiment seems cautious. I estimate a slightly higher chance of a price rise if the earnings meet or exceed expectations but a substantial risk of falling if the results disappoint. Hence, I estimate the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell. This creates uncertainty. The market's reaction will depend heavily on whether Apple meets, beats, or misses expectations. Given the mixed performance of other tech giants (Tesla rising despite earnings miss, Microsoft's Azure disappointment, Meta's strong profit), the market sentiment appears sensitive. However, the report being after hours suggests the actual figures will drive the movement and it could go either way depending on the contents of the quarterly report. Presuming similar volatility to Tesla and Meta, there is more likelihood of a larger move up if the report turns out to be better than predicted than a move down if it disappoints.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple among several companies with significant market movement. However, the content only states that Apple's quarterly report is forthcoming.  There is no information on expected earnings or any other specific factors that would directly influence the stock price before the report release. Therefore, the probability of a rise or fall is largely based on general market sentiment and pre-existing expectations surrounding Apple's performance. Given Apple's generally positive market position, a slight bias towards a rise is assumed, but the uncertainty is high due to the lack of specific news impacting the stock price. Prior to the earnings release, any price movement is likely to be driven by broader market trends and speculation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, but it does not provide specific details about the company's performance or guidance. Typically, anticipation around a company's earnings report can lead to increased volatility in its stock price. However, without specific information about the expected earnings, revenue, or other key performance indicators, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction. The article focuses more on other companies' performances and how they might influence the market. Given that the news does not directly mention Apple's current performance or any negative developments, there's a cautious optimism that could lead to a slight increase in stock price if the report meets or exceeds expectations. But, the lack of specific details about Apple's upcoming report makes it hard to assess the impact accurately.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article does not provide a direct positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it only mentions that the company's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday. However, the overall tone of the article seems neutral to positive, with other major tech companies like Tesla and Meta reporting mixed results but with some positive outlooks. Given the lack of direct information about Apple's performance, the market's reaction will likely be muted until the actual earnings report is released. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the general market sentiment and the potential for surprise in the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming quarterly report for Apple is creating uncertainty, as the market is weighing mixed results from other tech stocks. While Tesla's growth optimism led to a rise despite an earnings miss, Meta reported strong results that may create a favorable sentiment environment. Given Apple's history of performance and mixed sentiments around its peers, there exists a cautious optimism leading into the report. The lack of specific indicators within the news article about Apple's performance means that expectations are largely speculative. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher chance of a rise if the earnings meet or exceed expectations, which contributes to a balanced probability estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report and mixed performance from other tech companies (Tesla, Microsoft, Meta). The market is anticipating Apple's report, creating volatility. Previous models generally predicted a slight rise due to a generally positive market sentiment toward Apple, but acknowledges significant uncertainty before earnings are released. Considering the mixed results of peers, the actual report's details will be key. Given that, along with other predictive models edging for a slightly higher probability of a rise, I feel a slightly higher probability but acknowledge it highly depends on meeting or exceeding expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news provides little directly relevant information about Apple's imminent earnings report.  The mixed performance of other tech companies (Tesla up despite a miss, Microsoft down, Meta up) creates a somewhat uncertain market sentiment.  However, the pre-earnings period usually involves increased volatility due to speculation. The previous predictions show a range of opinions with a slight leaning toward a higher probability of a price rise.  I weight my prediction more towards a neutral stance before the report release, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive surprise in the upcoming report.  However, a significant negative surprise could easily lead to a price drop. The lack of specific pre-report news greatly diminishes the predictive power beyond general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple's upcoming quarterly report, which is a significant event that can influence the stock price. The article does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, but it highlights mixed results from other tech giants like Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta. This mixed performance in the tech sector could lead to cautious sentiment among investors. Given the uncertainty surrounding Apple's earnings report and the lack of specific positive or negative indicators, the probabilities are balanced. However, considering Apple's generally strong market position and the potential for positive surprises, there is a slight bias towards a price rise. The previous predictions from other models also show a slight leaning towards a rise, with probabilities around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, I estimate similar probabilities, reflecting the cautious optimism and uncertainty ahead of the earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday. This creates uncertainty among investors. The mixed performance of other tech stocks in the news, such as Microsoft's misses alongside Meta's strong report, may lead to cautious sentiment towards Apple's results. Given that earnings reports can significantly influence stock prices based on meeting or exceeding analysts' expectations, the overall market sentiment seems cautious. However, since the report is scheduled after hours, the market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual figures. Assuming Apple's report could potentially meet or beat expectations given its generally positive market position, there's a slight bias towards a rise. But, the uncertainty is high due to the lack of specific news impacting the stock price before the report release.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article does not provide direct information about Apple's performance, but it mentions the company's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday. The mixed performance of other tech stocks in the news, such as Tesla's earnings miss and Meta's strong report, may lead to cautious sentiment towards Apple's results. Considering the uncertainty and the lack of specific details about Apple's upcoming report, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on general market sentiment. Previous predictions from other models show a trend towards a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising, potentially due to optimism about the company's growth projections or the overall positive market position of Apple. However, the uncertainty is high, and the actual figures from the quarterly report will significantly influence the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed performances from other tech giants such as Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, and others. Apple's quarterlies are scheduled for after the closing bell, adding uncertainty as to how it will perform. While there is a cautious optimism due to positive performances from some companies, the actual release of Apple's earnings report will determine its stock movement. Previous predictions suggest a slight lean towards a possible uptick if expectations are met or exceeded, but there is also a risk of a downturn if results fall short. The market seems to remain cautious and speculative ahead of the official earnings announcement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
