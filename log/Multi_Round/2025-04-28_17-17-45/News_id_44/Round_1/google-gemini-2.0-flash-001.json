      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\nNews Content: Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings miss analysts\u2019 estimates but the stock rises on optimism over the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s growth projections, Microsoft\u2019s Azure growth misses estimates, and Meta\u2019s fourth-quarter profit handily tops forecasts. Apple\u2019s quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, which creates uncertainty among investors. The mixed performance of other tech stocks in the news, such as Microsoft's misses alongside Meta's strong report, may lead to cautious sentiment towards Apple's results. Given that earnings reports can significantly influence stock prices based on meeting or exceeding analysts' expectations, the overall market sentiment seems cautious. I estimate a slightly higher chance of a price rise if the earnings meet or exceed expectations but a substantial risk of falling if the results disappoint. Hence, I estimate the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell. This creates uncertainty. The market's reaction will depend heavily on whether Apple meets, beats, or misses expectations. Given the mixed performance of other tech giants (Tesla rising despite earnings miss, Microsoft's Azure disappointment, Meta's strong profit), the market sentiment appears sensitive. However, the report being after hours suggests the actual figures will drive the movement and it could go either way depending on the contents of the quarterly report. Presuming similar volatility to Tesla and Meta, there is more likelihood of a larger move up if the report turns out to be better than predicted than a move down if it disappoints.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple among several companies with significant market movement. However, the content only states that Apple's quarterly report is forthcoming.  There is no information on expected earnings or any other specific factors that would directly influence the stock price before the report release. Therefore, the probability of a rise or fall is largely based on general market sentiment and pre-existing expectations surrounding Apple's performance. Given Apple's generally positive market position, a slight bias towards a rise is assumed, but the uncertainty is high due to the lack of specific news impacting the stock price. Prior to the earnings release, any price movement is likely to be driven by broader market trends and speculation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, but it does not provide specific details about the company's performance or guidance. Typically, anticipation around a company's earnings report can lead to increased volatility in its stock price. However, without specific information about the expected earnings, revenue, or other key performance indicators, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction. The article focuses more on other companies' performances and how they might influence the market. Given that the news does not directly mention Apple's current performance or any negative developments, there's a cautious optimism that could lead to a slight increase in stock price if the report meets or exceeds expectations. But, the lack of specific details about Apple's upcoming report makes it hard to assess the impact accurately.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article does not provide a direct positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it only mentions that the company's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday. However, the overall tone of the article seems neutral to positive, with other major tech companies like Tesla and Meta reporting mixed results but with some positive outlooks. Given the lack of direct information about Apple's performance, the market's reaction will likely be muted until the actual earnings report is released. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the general market sentiment and the potential for surprise in the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
