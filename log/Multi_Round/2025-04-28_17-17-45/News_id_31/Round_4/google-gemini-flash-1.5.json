      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Q1 Services Revenue Jump Helps It Beat Analyst Estimates\nNews Content: Apple reported robust fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, despite mixed performance in key segments.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 Services revenue has shown a significant increase, helping the company exceed analyst expectations. This is a positive signal for investors, as it highlights strong performance in a key growth segment. Even though there is mixed performance in other segments, beating analyst estimates typically leads to positive stock price movement. Hence, the probabilities lean towards a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple beating analyst estimates is generally positive news, indicating strong performance and investor confidence. The increase in services revenue is a key driver, as this segment often has higher margins and is more predictable than hardware sales. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall message is positive due to the earnings beat, suggesting a likely positive investor reaction. Therefore, a rise in stock price is more probable than a fall. However, 'mention of mixed performance' can lead to a slight correction later on. Considering that these kinds of issues can be overlooked to go with the main sentiment, I give it a slightly higher probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple beat analyst estimates for Q1 2025, driven by strong Services revenue. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall positive earnings beat is usually a significant driver for stock price increases.  Investors generally react favorably to exceeding expectations. However, the mention of mixed performance in other segments introduces some uncertainty and potential for a muted reaction or even slight negative impact if those details are concerning. Therefore, a high probability of a price rise is assigned, but not a certainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded analyst expectations, primarily driven by a significant jump in Services revenue. This positive earnings beat typically instills investor confidence and can lead to a rise in stock price. Although there is mention of mixed performance in key segments, the overall positive outcome suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has beaten analyst estimates for its Q1 earnings, driven by a jump in services revenue. This positive earnings surprise typically leads to an increase in stock price as it demonstrates the company's ability to perform better than expected. Although the news mentions mixed performance in key segments, the overall beat in earnings and revenue growth in services suggests a stronger outlook for the company. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance of its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, as services revenue is a significant growth area for the company. Therefore, the general market reaction is expected to be favorable.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report beat analyst estimates, primarily driven by a significant increase in services revenue, which is a key growth segment for the company. This positive performance generally instills investor confidence and suggests a likely positive market reaction. While there is mention of mixed performance in some key segments, the predominant theme is positive due to the earnings beat. Multiple predictors show similar probabilities leaning towards a rise. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign a high probability that the stock price will rise and a lower probability for it to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The prior predictions consistently assigned a high probability to a stock price increase due to Apple beating analyst estimates, driven by strong services revenue. The mention of 'mixed performance' tempered expectations slightly but didn't outweigh the positive impact of the earnings beat. I concur with this assessment. Beating expectations, particularly with a growing revenue stream like services (which often have high margins), is a strong positive signal. Therefore, maintaining a bullish stance seems justified. However, given the consistency of the previous estimates, I'll nudge my confidence down a bit to account for potential overestimation in earlier rounds or some hidden negative information that the market might be aware of and is not mentioned in the news. Also the mixed performance segments can have a negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive: Apple beat analyst expectations, driven by strong Services revenue growth. While the news mentions mixed performance in other segments, this is often overshadowed by an overall earnings beat.  The consensus among previous models is a high probability of a price rise (averaging around 0.73). I'm taking into account the consistent positive predictions from multiple models, along with the inherent positive sentiment within the news itself. The mention of 'mixed performance' suggests a slight chance of a price correction or a less exuberant rise than might be expected from a purely positive earnings report. Therefore, I am adjusting the probability of a rise slightly downward from the average of previous predictions to account for this potential offset.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported robust Q1 earnings, beating analyst expectations primarily due to a significant jump in Services revenue. This segment is a key growth area for Apple, often characterized by higher margins and predictability. While the news mentions mixed performance in other segments, the overall positive earnings beat is likely to dominate investor sentiment. Historical trends suggest that beating analyst estimates typically leads to a positive stock price reaction. The consensus among previous models also leans heavily towards a stock price rise, with most predictions ranging between 0.7 and 0.8 for a rise and 0.2 to 0.3 for a fall. Considering the strong positive signal from the earnings beat and the general market reaction to such news, the probability of the stock price rising is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has beaten analyst estimates for its Q1 earnings, driven by a jump in services revenue. This positive earnings surprise typically leads to an increase in stock price as it demonstrates the company's ability to perform better than expected. Although the news mentions mixed performance in key segments, the overall beat in earnings and revenue growth in services suggests a stronger outlook for the company. Considering the predictions from previous rounds, there is a general consensus among models that the stock price is likely to rise due to this news. The majority of models have assigned a higher probability to the stock price rising, with predictions ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Given this information, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has beaten analyst estimates for its Q1 earnings, led by a significant increase in services revenue. Despite mentioning mixed performance in certain segments, the overall earnings beat highlights a strong performance which is typically well-received by the market. Previous predictions from different models also show a strong inclination towards a rise in stock price, with most models giving probabilities ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. The services revenue, being a vital growth segment, contributes significantly to investor confidence. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the stock price is more likely to rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report shows a significant beat on analyst estimates, primarily driven by strong growth in services revenue. This positive performance is expected to instill investor confidence, typically resulting in an upward stock price movement. While there is mention of mixed performance in other segments, the overall earnings beat will likely dominate investor sentiment. The predictions from various models in previous rounds indicate a high probability of stock price appreciation, averaging about 0.78 for a rise. Thus, I assign a slightly conservative but still high probability of the stock price rising while maintaining a lower probability for a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.81, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.19, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings beat analyst estimates, largely attributed to a surge in services revenue, typically a high-margin and predictable segment. Despite 'mixed performance' in some areas, the overall beat usually inspires investor confidence. Prior model predictions consistently lean towards a price increase, predominantly ranging between 0.7 and 0.8 for a rise and 0.2 to 0.3 for a fall. Taking the consensus into account and noting no significant adverse information emerges, the slightly increased emphasis is put positive momentum, thus slightly increasing probability of stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's exceeding analyst expectations on Q1 earnings, driven by strong Services revenue growth, is a significant positive factor.  The mention of 'mixed performance in key segments' introduces a degree of uncertainty, but the overall positive earnings beat is likely to dominate investor sentiment.  The consensus of the previous prediction rounds strongly suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase, with most models converging around a 70-80% chance of a rise.  While the mixed performance could cause a slight correction or dampen the initial positive reaction, the strength of the earnings beat and the consistent predictions from multiple models lead me to maintain a bullish outlook. I am slightly adjusting downward from the average of the previous round to account for the potential negative impact of the 'mixed performance' in other segments, while still recognizing the overall positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.77, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.23, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s robust Q1 earnings, which exceeded analyst expectations primarily due to a significant increase in Services revenue.

Most previous predictions leaned heavily towards a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging between 0.7 and 0.8. Given the strong positive signal from the earnings beat and the general market reaction to such news, the probability of the stock price rising is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.76, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.24, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported robust Q1 earnings, beating analyst expectations primarily due to a significant jump in Services revenue. This positive earnings surprise typically leads to an increase in stock price as it demonstrates the company's ability to perform better than expected. Although the news mentions mixed performance in key segments, the overall beat in earnings and revenue growth in services suggests a stronger outlook for the company. Considering the consistency of previous predictions and the positive impact of beating analyst estimates, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.79, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.21, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has beaten analyst estimates for its Q1 earnings, driven by a jump in services revenue. This positive earnings surprise typically leads to an increase in stock price as it demonstrates the company's ability to perform better than expected.

The services revenue, being a vital growth segment, contributes significantly to investor confidence. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the stock price is more likely to rise.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.79, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.21, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report indicates a significant beat on analyst estimates, primarily driven by strong growth in services revenue, which is a critical area for the company. While the report does mention mixed performance in other segments, the overall strong earnings beat generally boosts investor confidence and tends to lead to upward stock price movement. The previous rounds of predictions from various models consistently reflect a high probability of stock price rise, averaging around 0.78. Given this consensus and the absence of any significant adverse information, I assess a slightly higher probability for price appreciation while still considering the potential for some uncertainty due to the mixed performance details.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings beat analyst estimates, primarily driven by strong services revenue growth. While \"mixed performance in key segments\" tempers some enthusiasm, the overall positive surprise generally instills investor confidence and leads to a stock price increase. Previous rounds of predictions consistently reflect this sentiment, clustering between 0.7 and 0.8 for a rise. I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise as the consistency continues, balanced against the cautionary note about the \"mixed performance.\"\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.76, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.24, Reasoning: Apple's exceeding analyst expectations on Q1 earnings, driven primarily by strong Services revenue growth, is a significant positive.  The consistent predictions across multiple models in previous rounds strongly support a price increase.  The average prediction across all models in rounds 1 and 2 shows a strong bias toward a price rise. While the news mentions mixed performance in other segments, this is likely to be overshadowed by the overall positive earnings beat in the high-margin services sector.  The consistent upward trend in predictions across rounds suggests a market expectation of a positive stock price reaction. However, maintaining a probability of a rise below 1 reflects the inherent uncertainty in the market and the potential for the 'mixed performance' in other segments to cause a slight correction or dampen the initial reaction. I am slightly lowering the probability compared to the average of previous rounds to be more conservative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.77, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.23, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.
