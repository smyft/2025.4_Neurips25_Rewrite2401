      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Q1 Services Revenue Jump Helps It Beat Analyst Estimates\nNews Content: Apple reported robust fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, despite mixed performance in key segments.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 Services revenue has shown a significant increase, helping the company exceed analyst expectations. This is a positive signal for investors, as it highlights strong performance in a key growth segment. Even though there is mixed performance in other segments, beating analyst estimates typically leads to positive stock price movement. Hence, the probabilities lean towards a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple beating analyst estimates is generally positive news, indicating strong performance and investor confidence. The increase in services revenue is a key driver, as this segment often has higher margins and is more predictable than hardware sales. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall message is positive due to the earnings beat, suggesting a likely positive investor reaction. Therefore, a rise in stock price is more probable than a fall. However, 'mention of mixed performance' can lead to a slight correction later on. Considering that these kinds of issues can be overlooked to go with the main sentiment, I give it a slightly higher probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple beat analyst estimates for Q1 2025, driven by strong Services revenue. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments', the overall positive earnings beat is usually a significant driver for stock price increases.  Investors generally react favorably to exceeding expectations. However, the mention of mixed performance in other segments introduces some uncertainty and potential for a muted reaction or even slight negative impact if those details are concerning. Therefore, a high probability of a price rise is assigned, but not a certainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded analyst expectations, primarily driven by a significant jump in Services revenue. This positive earnings beat typically instills investor confidence and can lead to a rise in stock price. Although there is mention of mixed performance in key segments, the overall positive outcome suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has beaten analyst estimates for its Q1 earnings, driven by a jump in services revenue. This positive earnings surprise typically leads to an increase in stock price as it demonstrates the company's ability to perform better than expected. Although the news mentions mixed performance in key segments, the overall beat in earnings and revenue growth in services suggests a stronger outlook for the company. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance of its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, as services revenue is a significant growth area for the company. Therefore, the general market reaction is expected to be favorable.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
