The increase in services revenue is a key driver, as this segment often has higher margins and is more predictable than hardware sales. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall message is positive due to the earnings beat, suggesting a likely positive investor reaction. Therefore, a rise in stock price is more probable than a fall. However, 'mention of mixed performance' can lead to a slight correction later on. Considering that these kinds of issues can be overlooked to go with the main sentiment, I give it a slightly higher probability.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Q1 Services Revenue Jump Helps It Beat Analyst Estimates\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.75,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.25\n}\n```"
