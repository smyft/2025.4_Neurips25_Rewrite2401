A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downward trend in the tech sector, largely influenced by concerns about a competitor's AI advancements and the potential implications of upcoming earnings reports. With Apple set to report earnings amidst negative sentiment towards tech stocks and uncertainties regarding Federal Reserve policy, this could lead to cautious trading behavior. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a higher chance of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the overall market sentiment seems negative ('US stock futures falling', 'tech sector tumbles') due to the DeepSeek AI news, which could pressure the stock price downwards, it also highlights the upcoming earnings report. Earnings reports often create volatility. Strong earnings and positive guidance could offset the negative AI news impact. The Federal Reserve's meeting adds another layer of uncertainty. Their decisions on interest rates directly influence economic growth and can impact tech stocks. Considering the initial downwards pressure and the uncertainty around the earnings report and Fed meeting, I'm giving a higher probability of a fall initially, with the caveat that the actual earnings will significantly shift this probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. The negative impact of DeepSeek AI on the tech sector is a bearish signal, suggesting a potential decrease in AAPL's price.  Apple's upcoming earnings report is a major event that could significantly move the stock in either direction depending on the results. Positive earnings could outweigh the negative sentiment from DeepSeek, while disappointing earnings would likely exacerbate the negative sentiment. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor.  Increased interest rates generally negatively impact tech stocks, as they increase borrowing costs and reduce investor appetite for growth stocks.  Considering these mixed signals, with the negative news potentially having immediate effects, it is difficult to assign a specific probability.  The news doesn't provide any positive indicators specifically relevant to Apple, and the negative sentiment towards the tech sector is likely to impact Apple along with others.  However, the upcoming earnings report could easily outweigh these negative factors if the results are positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI and the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple. Additionally, the Federal Reserve meeting could introduce uncertainty regarding interest rates, which typically affects tech stocks negatively due to their reliance on borrowing. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector is tumbling due to concerns about the newest artificial intelligence model developed by China's DeepSeek. Additionally, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which can introduce volatility in the stock price. However, there is no directly negative information specific to Apple in the provided news content. The Federal Reserve's policy meeting and its impact on interest rates could also influence Apple's stock price, but the direction of this influence is uncertain. Given that the news does not directly target Apple with negative information, but rather discusses a general tech sector downturn and an upcoming earnings report, the probabilities are cautiously estimated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector, including Apple, is tumbling due to the introduction of a new artificial intelligence model by China's DeepSeek, which may pose a competitive threat. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting may lead to interest rate changes that could affect the overall market. However, the earnings reports from Apple and other major tech companies may provide a positive surprise, potentially offsetting the negative impact. Given these mixed factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
