While the overall market sentiment seems negative ('US stock futures falling', 'tech sector tumbles') due to the DeepSeek AI news, which could pressure the stock price downwards, it also highlights the upcoming earnings report. Earnings reports often create volatility. Strong earnings and positive guidance could offset the negative AI news impact. The Federal Reserve's meeting adds another layer of uncertainty. Their decisions on interest rates directly influence economic growth and can impact tech stocks. Considering the initial downwards pressure and the uncertainty around the earnings report and Fed meeting, I'm giving a higher probability of a fall initially, with the caveat that the actual earnings will significantly shift this probability.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stocks react to DeepSeek AI, tech earnings, Fed meeting: 3 Things\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
