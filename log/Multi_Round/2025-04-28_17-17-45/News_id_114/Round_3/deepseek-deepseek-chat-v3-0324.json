A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downward trend in the tech sector, largely influenced by concerns about a competitor's AI advancements and the potential implications of upcoming earnings reports. With Apple set to report earnings amidst negative sentiment towards tech stocks and uncertainties regarding Federal Reserve policy, this could lead to cautious trading behavior. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a higher chance of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the overall market sentiment seems negative ('US stock futures falling', 'tech sector tumbles') due to the DeepSeek AI news, which could pressure the stock price downwards, it also highlights the upcoming earnings report. Earnings reports often create volatility. Strong earnings and positive guidance could offset the negative AI news impact. The Federal Reserve's meeting adds another layer of uncertainty. Their decisions on interest rates directly influence economic growth and can impact tech stocks. Considering the initial downwards pressure and the uncertainty around the earnings report and Fed meeting, I'm giving a higher probability of a fall initially, with the caveat that the actual earnings will significantly shift this probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. The negative impact of DeepSeek AI on the tech sector is a bearish signal, suggesting a potential decrease in AAPL's price.  Apple's upcoming earnings report is a major event that could significantly move the stock in either direction depending on the results. Positive earnings could outweigh the negative sentiment from DeepSeek, while disappointing earnings would likely exacerbate the negative sentiment. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor.  Increased interest rates generally negatively impact tech stocks, as they increase borrowing costs and reduce investor appetite for growth stocks.  Considering these mixed signals, with the negative news potentially having immediate effects, it is difficult to assign a specific probability.  The news doesn't provide any positive indicators specifically relevant to Apple, and the negative sentiment towards the tech sector is likely to impact Apple along with others.  However, the upcoming earnings report could easily outweigh these negative factors if the results are positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI and the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple. Additionally, the Federal Reserve meeting could introduce uncertainty regarding interest rates, which typically affects tech stocks negatively due to their reliance on borrowing. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector is tumbling due to concerns about the newest artificial intelligence model developed by China's DeepSeek. Additionally, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which can introduce volatility in the stock price. However, there is no directly negative information specific to Apple in the provided news content. The Federal Reserve's policy meeting and its impact on interest rates could also influence Apple's stock price, but the direction of this influence is uncertain. Given that the news does not directly target Apple with negative information, but rather discusses a general tech sector downturn and an upcoming earnings report, the probabilities are cautiously estimated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news mentions that the tech sector, including Apple, is tumbling due to the introduction of a new artificial intelligence model by China's DeepSeek, which may pose a competitive threat. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting may lead to interest rate changes that could affect the overall market. However, the earnings reports from Apple and other major tech companies may provide a positive surprise, potentially offsetting the negative impact. Given these mixed factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news highlights a negative trend in the tech sector due to concerns about a new AI model from China's DeepSeek. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report for Apple (AAPL) adds uncertainty, as earnings can lead to volatility in stock prices. The Federal Reserve's potential interest rate decisions also create an environment of caution which generally detracts from growth stocks like tech. Given these factors, including the prevailing negative sentiment, it seems more likely that Apple's stock will face downward pressure despite any potential volatility from earnings that could result in upward movement if results are strong. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from Round 0 leans towards a negative forecast for Apple's stock price, primarily driven by concerns surrounding DeepSeek AI's impact on the tech sector and general economic uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. Most models in Round 0 assigned a higher probability to a stock price decrease. While the upcoming earning reports could potentially boost the stock price, the initial negativity and market volatility due to external macroeconomy has a higher effect on the stock. Taking into consideration the previous round's conclusions of negative trend, I am still more inclined to suggest price going down in short-term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The broad negative sentiment in the tech sector due to DeepSeek AI and the upcoming Fed meeting leans towards a price decrease. However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard. Positive results could easily outweigh the negative market sentiment.  Analyzing previous predictions, there's a consensus leaning slightly towards a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 probability. I'm adjusting this slightly upward to account for the potential positive impact of strong earnings, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty involved. The fact that other models predict a higher chance of falling likely reflects lack of positive specific news about AAPL, while the negative news has a broader sector impact and will likely affect AAPL. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a negative sentiment in the tech sector driven by concerns over China's DeepSeek AI, which could pressure Apple's stock price downward. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, introducing potential volatility. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds another layer of uncertainty, as interest rate decisions can impact tech stocks. While earnings could provide a positive surprise, the immediate negative sentiment and sector-wide downturn suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a fall, with most estimates ranging between 0.55 and 0.7 for a decline. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI and the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple. Additionally, the Federal Reserve meeting could introduce uncertainty regarding interest rates, which typically affects tech stocks negatively due to their reliance on borrowing. However, Apple's specific earnings report could potentially offset some negative sentiment if the results are positive. Considering these mixed factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a downward trend in the tech sector due to concerns about a competitor's AI advancements and the potential implications of upcoming earnings reports. The fact that four major tech companies, including Apple, are set to report earnings this week adds uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's meeting could also influence the stock price, but the direction of this influence is uncertain. Considering the mixed signals and the cautious tone from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than rising. However, the actual earnings report could significantly shift this probability.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to the advancement of China's DeepSeek AI model. This has led to a decrease in stock futures, including those of tech giants such as Apple. Apple is also scheduled to report earnings this week, which could bring significant volatility. While the upcoming earnings report could either positively or negatively surprise investors, the current sentiment and the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision add further volatility to the stock. Given the current context, the negative sentiments dominate, with a higher likelihood for the stock price to fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative sentiment in the tech sector primarily due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI advancements, which have contributed to a decline in stock futures. Apple is set to report earnings soon, creating potential for volatility. However, the overall market sentiment is bearish, and uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision exacerbate the negative outlook. Although strong earnings could positively impact the stock price, the prevailing negative factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment regarding the tech sector, driven by DeepSeek AI concerns and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve meeting, continues to outweigh any potential positive impact from Apple's upcoming earnings report. Previous predictions consistently favored a higher probability of a stock price fall. While earnings could shift this, there is no specific positive Apple-related news to counteract the broad tech sector concerns. I will stay with the trend and predict an increased chance of the price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall negative sentiment in the tech sector due to DeepSeek AI and the upcoming Fed meeting points towards a potential price decrease.  However, Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant factor that could significantly shift the probabilities.  Positive earnings could easily outweigh the negative market sentiment.  Analysis of previous predictions reveals a consensus leaning towards a price fall, but there's a noticeable range in the predictions, suggesting significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a greater chance of a fall in the early rounds, though they gradually shift towards more balanced predictions in the subsequent rounds. I am taking this into account and adjusting the probability accordingly, giving a higher weighting to the potential for a negative impact before the release of the earnings report, and acknowledging the potential for a positive surprise from strong Apple earnings. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a negative sentiment in the tech sector due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI, which has led to a decline in stock futures and a tumble in the tech sector. Apple (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which could introduce volatility, but the current market sentiment is bearish. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds uncertainty, as interest rate decisions typically impact tech stocks negatively. While Apple's earnings could provide a positive surprise, the immediate negative sentiment and sector-wide downturn suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.

Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI model and the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's policy meeting could introduce uncertainty regarding interest rates, which typically affects tech stocks negatively. While Apple's specific earnings report could potentially offset some negative sentiment if the results are positive, the overall trend and sentiment lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the mixed factors and the cautious tone from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to concerns over China's DeepSeek AI and the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple.
