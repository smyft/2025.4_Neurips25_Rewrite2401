(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.
