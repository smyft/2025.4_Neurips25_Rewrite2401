(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's AI leadership through the launch of Apple Intelligence and expectations of a strong earnings report driven by iPhone 16 demand. However, it also highlights concerns regarding lowered iPhone unit estimates due to a weak macro environment and the staggered rollout of AI features. Given the balance of positive AI initiatives and potential short-term weakness in iPhone sales, the overall outlook is uncertain, yet positioned slightly towards positive sentiment. Thus, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising (due to AI advancements) than falling (due to lowered iPhone estimates).\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While acknowledging Apple's foray into AI with \"Apple Intelligence,\" the article highlights concerns about weak macro environment and staggered AI feature launches leading to lowered iPhone unit estimates. The article also acknowledges Apple's ranking in the AI space but suggests other companies hold \"greater promise.\" The positive aspects are Apple's AI efforts and analyst's \"Buy\" rating based on the company's strong fundamentals like profit margins and cash flow. The negative is slowing iPhone sales. Also keep in mind the article is from January 2024, so the data is already reflected in the stock price. However, since AI is still a hot topic in 2024, the \"Apple Intelligence\" aspect carries some potential for a minor positive effect, but other AI companies may be more attractive which creates a moderate negative bias. Considering these factors, the probability leans slightly towards a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with Apple Intelligence and its strong position amongst AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and a slower-than-expected rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens the near-term outlook. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future potential. The overall AI landscape is also discussed, focusing on the intense competition between the US and China, which may impact Apple indirectly.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is somewhat tempered by the analyst downgrade and the uncertain competitive landscape, while the probability of a price fall reflects the concerns about the weak macro environment and slower AI feature adoption.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could be seen as a positive development. However, the article also mentions a lowered price target by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan due to weak macro environment and staggered adoption of AI features, which may temper investor enthusiasm. The broader context of US-China AI competition and regulatory uncertainties adds complexity. While Apple's strong profit margins and cash flow are positives, the near-term outlook for iPhone sales and AI adoption appears mixed. Overall, the news presents both opportunities and challenges for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strengthening leadership in AI with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. Although the article mentions a lowered price target by a BofA analyst, it also states that the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating due to Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow. Additionally, the article notes that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. Considering these factors, it seems that the overall sentiment towards Apple's AI endeavors is positive, which could lead to a rise in stock price. However, the lowered iPhone units estimate for fiscal Q2 might have a negative impact. Weighing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the company's strong fundamentals and AI leadership.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. However, there are mixed signals regarding the market impact with BofA analyst lowering their price target slightly, citing concerns over a weak macro environment and delayed generative AI feature rollouts. The article mentions that while Apple Inc. remains a strong investment, some competitors might offer higher returns within shorter time frames. This combination suggests cautious optimism rather than strong bullish or bearish signals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s efforts to enhance its position in the AI sector through the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is seen positively. However, it also mentions a downgrade in iPhone unit estimates due to a weak macro environment and delayed AI feature rollouts, which could negatively impact short-term performance. Despite the concerns raised, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating on Apple due to its strong fundamentals, profit margins, and cash flow. The overall sentiment reflects cautious optimism, but the mixed signals from the news imply a slightly higher chance of a price rise over a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook. Apple's \"Apple Intelligence\" strengthens its AI presence, which is a positive signal. However, lowered iPhone unit estimates due to macro conditions and staggered AI rollouts are negative. The BofA analyst still has a 'Buy' rating, indicating confidence in long-term fundamentals. The article highlights Apple's strong position in AI but suggests other AI stocks may have higher returns in the short-term. Considering previous predictions, there's a slight positive sentiment overall, reinforced by multiple models predicting a higher probability of a price rise in round 0, but also some recognition of the negative factors at play. Balancing the AI initiatives against potential economic slowdown and rollout challenges, and considering the article's age, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of the price rising, assuming the market hasn't fully priced in this information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the launch of Apple Intelligence, strengthening its AI leadership, and a maintained 'Buy' rating from BofA, citing strong fundamentals. Negative factors include lowered iPhone unit estimates due to a weak macro environment and a staggered rollout of AI features.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic; while the AI initiatives are positive, the near-term impact on iPhone sales presents a headwind.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a price rise but acknowledging the uncertainties. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that the news likely already influenced the stock price, a moderate probability of a rise is assigned, reflecting a balance between positive AI developments and concerns about near-term iPhone sales and macroeconomic factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the launch of Apple Intelligence underscores the company's commitment to AI, which could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, despite a slight reduction in the price target, BofA maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong fundamentals like profit margins and cash flow. On the negative side, the lowered iPhone unit estimates due to a weak macro environment and delayed AI feature rollouts may concern investors. Given these factors, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to Apple's strong market position and AI advancements, but the short-term challenges temper the optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's AI leadership and the launch of Apple Intelligence, which could be seen as a positive development. However, it also mentions a lowered price target by a BofA analyst due to a weak macro environment and staggered adoption of AI features, which may temper investor enthusiasm. Considering the mixed signals, I weigh the positive aspects such as Apple's strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow, against the negative aspects like the lowered iPhone units estimate for fiscal Q2. Additionally, taking into account the predictions from other models, there seems to be a slight leaning towards a positive outlook due to Apple's AI efforts and strong fundamentals, despite some models indicating a more cautious approach due to competitive and macroeconomic factors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers Apple's strengthening AI leadership with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is a positive factor. However, there are mixed sentiments expressed by analysts regarding the market impact due to a weak macro environment and slower-than-expected AI feature rollouts. The lowered price targets and iPhone unit estimates introduce additional uncertainties. Despite these concerns, Apple's strong fundamentals and position in the AI market suggest a higher likelihood of positive sentiment. The probability is influenced by the balance between these positive AI initiatives and negative sentiments about iPhone sales trends.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
