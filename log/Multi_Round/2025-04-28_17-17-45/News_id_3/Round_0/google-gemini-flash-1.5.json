The broader context is a Dow Jones dive due to Trump tariff orders, suggesting a negative market sentiment that would likely impact Apple negatively. While the inflation data (PCE) is slightly positive (2.6% annual basis), this is less directly relevant to Apple's performance than the immediate market reaction to the tariffs and Apple's specific price action.  The headline focuses on the negative aspects, outweighing the  mildly positive inflation news in terms of its impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```\n"
