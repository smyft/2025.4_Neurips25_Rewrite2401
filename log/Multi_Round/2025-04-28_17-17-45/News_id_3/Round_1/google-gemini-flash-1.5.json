      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\nNews Content: The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption and expenditures index, rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights macroeconomic factors affecting the stock market, particularly the rise in inflation as indicated by the personal consumption and expenditures index. This could lead to increased market volatility and pressure on stocks, including Apple Inc. Additionally, the mention of tariffs under former President Trump may create uncertainty in trade relations, which could impact tech companies like Apple that rely on global supply chains. Despite this, Apple has demonstrated resilience due to its strong fundamentals and product demand. Therefore, the stock price may have a slightly higher chance of declining in the short-term due to overall market sentiment, while a significant rise is less likely given the current economic climate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it mentions a \"Dow Jones Dive\" due to Trump's tariff order, which is generally negative for market sentiment and Apple, given its global supply chain. It also notes Apple broke a \"key level,\" which, without further context, is likely a negative indicator in technical analysis, suggesting a potential downtrend. A rising personal consumption and expenditures index usually translates into investors being bearish. However, the headline also notes MicroStrategy making a move along with NVIDIA. The article doesn't explicitly claim Apple also making moves. Considering the tariff order and potential technical breakdown, a negative outlook is slightly more probable. MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia might not be directly tied to Apple's potential. The rising inflation rate also contributes to bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple broke a key level, indicating a negative short-term trend.  The broader context is a Dow Jones dive due to Trump tariff orders, suggesting a negative market sentiment that would likely impact Apple negatively. While the inflation data (PCE) is slightly positive (2.6% annual basis), this is less directly relevant to Apple's performance than the immediate market reaction to the tariffs and Apple's specific price action.  The headline focuses on the negative aspects, outweighing the  mildly positive inflation news in terms of its impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a broader market decline ('Dow Jones Dives') due to a Trump tariff order, which suggests negative market sentiment. Additionally, the mention of Apple ('AAPL') breaking key levels implies technical weakness. The inflation data (PCE index rising 0.3% monthly and 2.6% annually) could further weigh on growth stocks like Apple, as higher inflation may delay Fed rate cuts. Given the negative market context and technical breakdown, the probability of a stock price fall is elevated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that the Dow Jones dives due to Trump's tariff order, and specific companies like Apple and Nvidia breaking key levels. This generally indicates a negative market movement. Additionally, the news about tariffs and inflation (as indicated by the PCE index rising) could negatively impact tech stocks like Apple due to potential increased costs and decreased consumer spending. However, the specific impact on Apple (AAPL) stock also depends on various factors including its supply chain, pricing power, and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the Dow Jones dives on Trump's tariff order, which is likely to have a negative impact on the stock market, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, it is mentioned that Apple and Nvidia break key levels, which could be an indication of a downward trend. However, the article also mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis, which might not have a direct significant impact on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that the Dow Jones is diving as a result of Trump's tariff order, which suggests a broad market downturn. While the article states that Apple, along with Nvidia, has broken key levels, it doesn't provide sufficient detail to determine whether these movements are positive or negative for Apple specifically. Additionally, the mention of rising inflation does not provide enough context about its potential impact on Apple\u2019s business operations. Without more specific details, it is challenging to predict the direct influence of this news on Apple\u2019s stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The broader market downturn due to Trump's tariff order is a significant negative factor, amplified by Apple breaking key technical levels. This points towards a higher probability of a price fall. The rising inflation, as measured by the PCE index, is another bearish factor, potentially impacting consumer spending, and further suggesting downward pressure. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and overall demand are likely mitigating these negative factors to some extent. Considering the consensus from previous models (leaning heavily towards a price fall) and the dominating negative factors in the news, I've adjusted my prediction slightly downwards compared to some of the initial predictions, reflecting the overall negative market context and Apple's vulnerability to broader economic headwinds. Thus, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.25,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.75\n}\n```\n"
