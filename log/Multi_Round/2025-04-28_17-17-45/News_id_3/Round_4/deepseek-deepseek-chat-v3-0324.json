      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\nNews Content: The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption and expenditures index, rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights macroeconomic factors affecting the stock market, particularly the rise in inflation as indicated by the personal consumption and expenditures index. This could lead to increased market volatility and pressure on stocks, including Apple Inc. Additionally, the mention of tariffs under former President Trump may create uncertainty in trade relations, which could impact tech companies like Apple that rely on global supply chains. Despite this, Apple has demonstrated resilience due to its strong fundamentals and product demand. Therefore, the stock price may have a slightly higher chance of declining in the short-term due to overall market sentiment, while a significant rise is less likely given the current economic climate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it mentions a \"Dow Jones Dive\" due to Trump's tariff order, which is generally negative for market sentiment and Apple, given its global supply chain. It also notes Apple broke a \"key level,\" which, without further context, is likely a negative indicator in technical analysis, suggesting a potential downtrend. A rising personal consumption and expenditures index usually translates into investors being bearish. However, the headline also notes MicroStrategy making a move along with NVIDIA. The article doesn't explicitly claim Apple also making moves. Considering the tariff order and potential technical breakdown, a negative outlook is slightly more probable. MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia might not be directly tied to Apple's potential. The rising inflation rate also contributes to bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple broke a key level, indicating a negative short-term trend.  The broader context is a Dow Jones dive due to Trump tariff orders, suggesting a negative market sentiment that would likely impact Apple negatively. While the inflation data (PCE) is slightly positive (2.6% annual basis), this is less directly relevant to Apple's performance than the immediate market reaction to the tariffs and Apple's specific price action.  The headline focuses on the negative aspects, outweighing the  mildly positive inflation news in terms of its impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a broader market decline ('Dow Jones Dives') due to a Trump tariff order, which suggests negative market sentiment. Additionally, the mention of Apple ('AAPL') breaking key levels implies technical weakness. The inflation data (PCE index rising 0.3% monthly and 2.6% annually) could further weigh on growth stocks like Apple, as higher inflation may delay Fed rate cuts. Given the negative market context and technical breakdown, the probability of a stock price fall is elevated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that the Dow Jones dives due to Trump's tariff order, and specific companies like Apple and Nvidia breaking key levels. This generally indicates a negative market movement. Additionally, the news about tariffs and inflation (as indicated by the PCE index rising) could negatively impact tech stocks like Apple due to potential increased costs and decreased consumer spending. However, the specific impact on Apple (AAPL) stock also depends on various factors including its supply chain, pricing power, and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the Dow Jones dives on Trump's tariff order, which is likely to have a negative impact on the stock market, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, it is mentioned that Apple and Nvidia break key levels, which could be an indication of a downward trend. However, the article also mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis, which might not have a direct significant impact on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news mentions that the Dow Jones is diving as a result of Trump's tariff order, which suggests a broad market downturn. While the article states that Apple, along with Nvidia, has broken key levels, it doesn't provide sufficient detail to determine whether these movements are positive or negative for Apple specifically. Additionally, the mention of rising inflation does not provide enough context about its potential impact on Apple\u2019s business operations. Without more specific details, it is challenging to predict the direct influence of this news on Apple\u2019s stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The overall sentiment from the news indicates a negative market reaction primarily due to Trump's tariff order, which is likely to impact companies like Apple that depend on global supply chains. The breaking of key levels by Apple adds to the technical weakness narrative, suggesting a potential downward price movement. Additionally, the rise in inflation, as indicated by the personal consumption and expenditures index, could contribute to market volatility and bearish sentiment. Given these factors, despite Apple's strong fundamentals, the immediate market outlook appears more negative with a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across all previous predictions, primarily due to the 'Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order' and 'Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels' indications, suggests a continued bearish outlook for Apple. The rising inflation (PCE index) further adds to the negative sentiment, making it likely that the stock price will fall. While I recognize that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, there doesn't seem to be any new information that would shift the balance towards a more positive prediction. Given I can not observe the actual 'key level' that it indicates breaking, I can not deduce the impact it has on the rise and fall probablity. Thus, it will remain in uncertainty, leading to a relatively lower probability for increase while maintaining a higher probability for a fall in stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The broader market downturn due to Trump's tariff order is a significant negative factor, amplified by Apple breaking key technical levels. This points towards a higher probability of a price fall. The rising inflation, as measured by the PCE index, is another bearish factor, potentially impacting consumer spending, and further suggesting downward pressure. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and overall demand are likely mitigating these negative factors to some extent. Considering the consensus from previous models (leaning heavily towards a price fall) and the dominating negative factors in the news, I've adjusted my prediction slightly downwards compared to some of the initial predictions, reflecting the overall negative market context and Apple's vulnerability to broader economic headwinds. Thus, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than rising.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order, which generally affects tech stocks like Apple (AAPL) that rely on global supply chains. Apple is mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting technical weakness, and the rising inflation data could further pressure growth stocks. Although Apple has strong fundamentals, the immediate market reaction and technical indicators point to a higher likelihood of a short-term decline. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to Trump's tariff order, which has led to a Dow Jones dive. Additionally, Apple and Nvidia breaking key levels suggest a potential downtrend for these stocks. The inflation data, as indicated by the PCE index rising 0.3% monthly and 2.6% annually, could further weigh on growth stocks like Apple, as higher inflation may delay Fed rate cuts and impact consumer spending. However, Apple has demonstrated resilience due to its strong fundamentals and product demand. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising, but the impact of tariffs and inflation data on Apple's stock is somewhat mitigated by its strong market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones dive on Trump's tariff order, which may impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) negatively. The mention of Apple breaking key levels further indicates a potential downward trend. While the inflation data (PCE index) is mildly positive, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is less significant compared to the immediate market reaction to tariffs and Apple's price action. Considering the majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple macroeconomic and market-related factors that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price. The Dow Jones Diving on Trump's tariff order suggests negative market sentiment, which is commonly associated with reduced confidence in equity markets. Moreover, Apple and Nvidia breaking key levels may signal a potential technical weakness, as noted by multiple models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Although the inflation data (PCE index) shows a moderate increase, which might generally be viewed positively due to economic activity, it doesn't seem to outweigh the broader negative market conditions. The lack of specific details about how these factors impact Apple's fundamental business health contributes to the hesitance in assigning a higher rise probability.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative market sentiment primarily due to Trump's tariff order leading to a Dow Jones dive, which generally affects tech companies like Apple that rely on global supply chains. Furthermore, the mention of Apple breaking key levels suggests potential technical weakness, which is likely to result in downward price movement. The rising inflation data may contribute to market volatility and bearish sentiment, potentially delaying any rate cuts that would favor growth stocks. Despite Apple's strong fundamentals, the prevailing market conditions lean heavily towards a price decline. Consequently, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall compared to any potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across previous predictions, driven by the \"Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order\" and the mention of Apple breaking key levels, strongly suggests a continued bearish outlook. The rising inflation (PCE index) further reinforces this negative sentiment. While Apple possesses strong fundamentals, the prevailing macroeconomic headwinds and technical indicators point towards a higher likelihood of a price fall. The majority of previous models lean towards a falling stock price, reinforcing this prediction. However, the stock has recently shown a bit of bullishness, especially the prediction from deepseek, the model prediction is adjusted based on the current trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple. The Dow Jones dive due to Trump's tariff order creates broad market uncertainty, impacting Apple's global supply chains. Apple breaking key levels reinforces the technical bearish signal.  While the PCE inflation data is mildly positive, its impact seems less immediate than the tariff-related market reaction or the technical breakdown. The consensus of previous models consistently points towards a higher probability of a price fall, further supporting this conclusion.  Although Apple's strong fundamentals could mitigate some of the negative impacts, the short-term outlook, based on the provided news and previous analyses, leans heavily towards a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative market sentiment due to Trump's tariff order, leading to a Dow Jones dive, which generally impacts tech stocks like Apple (AAPL) that rely on global supply chains. Additionally, Apple breaking key levels suggests technical weakness, and the rising inflation data (PCE index) could further pressure growth stocks. While Apple has strong fundamentals and product demand, the immediate market reaction and technical indicators point to a higher likelihood of a short-term decline. The consensus from previous predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative market sentiment due to the Dow Jones diving on Trump's tariff order, which is likely to impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) negatively. The mention of Apple and Nvidia breaking key levels suggests technical weakness and a potential downward trend. The inflation data, as indicated by the PCE index rising 0.3% monthly and 2.6% annually, could further weigh on growth stocks like Apple, as higher inflation may delay Fed rate cuts and impact consumer spending. However, Apple has demonstrated resilience due to its strong fundamentals and product demand. Considering these factors and the consensus from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to Trump's tariff order, which has led to a Dow Jones dive. Additionally, Apple breaking key levels suggests a potential downtrend for the stock. The inflation data, as indicated by the PCE index rising 0.3% monthly and 2.6% annually, could further weigh on growth stocks like Apple. Considering the majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the overall negative market context, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and product demand are likely to mitigate the negative impact to some extent.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple macroeconomic and market-related factors that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price. The Dow Jones Diving on Trump's tariff order suggests negative market sentiment, which is commonly associated with reduced confidence in equity markets. Moreover, Apple and Nvidia breaking key levels may signal a potential technical weakness, as noted by multiple models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Although the inflation data (PCE index) shows a moderate increase, which might generally be viewed positively due to economic activity, it doesn't seem to outweigh the broader negative market conditions. The lack of specific details about how these factors impact Apple's fundamental business health contributes to the hesitance in assigning a higher rise probability.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headlines indicate a negative market sentiment primarily driven by the Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order. This uncertainty typically impacts tech companies, including Apple, which rely on global supply chains. Additionally, the report indicates that Apple has broken key technical levels, suggesting potential weakness in its stock price. The rise in inflation (PCE index) could further dampen investor sentiment, contributing to the likelihood of decreased consumer spending and potentially delaying favorable market conditions for growth stocks. Consequently, while Apple has strong fundamentals, the macroeconomic backdrop and technical indicators point toward a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment across previous predictions and the news headline continues to be negative. The Dow Jones dive due to potential tariffs and Apple breaking key levels strongly suggest a bearish outlook. Rising inflation further exacerbates these concerns. While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the immediate market reaction and technical indicators outweigh this, leading to a higher probability of a fall. The trend of predictions has also shown a consistent preference for a fall in stock price, which consolidates this negative analysis. Although some models have adjusted rising probabilities, the core assessment from all remains the same: downward trajectory.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple. The headline highlights a Dow Jones dive due to Trump's tariff order, creating broad market uncertainty and impacting Apple's global supply chains.  This is further compounded by Apple breaking key technical levels, a strong indicator of a potential downtrend.  While the PCE inflation data shows mild positive growth, this is overshadowed by the immediate negative market reaction to the tariffs and the technical weakness signaled by Apple's price action.  The overwhelming consensus among the previous models also points toward a higher probability of a price fall.  Although Apple's strong fundamentals could offer some mitigation, the short-term outlook, based on the provided news and previous analyses, strongly suggests a higher likelihood of a price decrease.  The consistent downward trend in probability estimates across the rounds further reinforces this negative outlook. However,  some slight bullishness is observed in Round 2 predictions which warrants a slightly higher probability of rise than the previous rounds. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative market sentiment due to Trump's tariff order, leading to a Dow Jones dive, which generally impacts tech stocks like Apple (AAPL) that rely on global supply chains.
