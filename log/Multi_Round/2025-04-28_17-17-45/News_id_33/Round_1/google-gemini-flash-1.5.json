(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The decrease in iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver for Apple, indicates potential challenges in meeting investor expectations. Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales relative to analyst projections can create negative sentiment among investors, leading to potential downward pressure on the stock price. As a result, there is a greater likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising, especially as investors are awaiting a payoff from AI initiatives that have yet to materialize.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2023 earnings showed a slight miss on iPhone sales, falling short of analyst expectations. While overall revenue showed a modest increase, the decline in iPhone sales, its most valuable product, is a concern. The news highlights the market's anticipation of an AI-driven growth spurt that hasn't yet materialized.  Investors are likely to react negatively to the missed expectations in the short term, potentially causing a price drop. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the long-term prospects tied to AI development could provide support. The probability of a stock price fall is higher in the immediate aftermath of this news due to the missed iPhone sales targets; however, the long-term outlook is less certain and dependent on the future success of Apple's AI initiatives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the overall revenue increased by 4% year-over-year, which might offset some of the negative impact. The mention of AI not yet contributing to growth adds uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, the stock price reaction is likely to be neutral to slightly negative in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's iPhone sales have declined slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst projections. This could be perceived negatively by investors, as it suggests that the company's most valuable product may not be experiencing the growth expected, particularly in relation to its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. However, the total revenue still showed a slight increase of almost 4% from the same quarter last year, which might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising could be lower, while the probability of it falling could be higher, but not extremely so, due to the relatively modest decline in iPhone sales and overall revenue growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This mixed result might lead to cautious investor behavior. The anticipation of AI payoff suggests potential for future growth, but the current sales figures might dampen short-term enthusiasm. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than falling in the immediate future.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's reported slight decline in iPhone sales in the December quarter falls short of analyst expectations and signals that the anticipated impact from AI software on their key product isn't materializing yet. Such underperformance in a core segment could dampen investor sentiment, particularly given high market expectations of Apple. However, the overall revenue growth, albeit modest, indicates the company isn't struggling and remains financially robust. This mixed signal suggests a cautious market reaction where a slight dip is more probable than a strong surge, but substantial volatility is likely.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While overall revenue grew slightly, the key takeaway is the underperformance of iPhone sales, falling short of analyst expectations. This is particularly concerning as the iPhone is Apple's most profitable product. The anticipated boost from AI integration hasn't materialized yet, further dampening investor enthusiasm.  The consistent prediction from previous models of a higher probability of a price fall reflects the potential for negative market reaction.  While the overall revenue increase provides some support, the missed expectations on iPhone sales (Apple's core business) are likely to outweigh this positive in the short term, leading to a downward pressure on the stock price. The consensus among the previous models, leaning heavily toward a price drop, strengthens this assessment.  However, the possibility of a rise is not entirely eliminated, as the overall revenue increase is a positive signal, and the long-term potential of AI integration remains.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.25,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.75\n}\n```\n"
