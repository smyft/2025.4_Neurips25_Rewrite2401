(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The decrease in iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver for Apple, indicates potential challenges in meeting investor expectations. Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales relative to analyst projections can create negative sentiment among investors, leading to potential downward pressure on the stock price. As a result, there is a greater likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising, especially as investors are awaiting a payoff from AI initiatives that have yet to materialize.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2023 earnings showed a slight miss on iPhone sales, falling short of analyst expectations. While overall revenue showed a modest increase, the decline in iPhone sales, its most valuable product, is a concern. The news highlights the market's anticipation of an AI-driven growth spurt that hasn't yet materialized.  Investors are likely to react negatively to the missed expectations in the short term, potentially causing a price drop. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the long-term prospects tied to AI development could provide support. The probability of a stock price fall is higher in the immediate aftermath of this news due to the missed iPhone sales targets; however, the long-term outlook is less certain and dependent on the future success of Apple's AI initiatives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales, missing analyst expectations, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the overall revenue increased by 4% year-over-year, which might offset some of the negative impact. The mention of AI not yet contributing to growth adds uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, the stock price reaction is likely to be neutral to slightly negative in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's iPhone sales have declined slightly in the December quarter, missing analyst projections. This could be perceived negatively by investors, as it suggests that the company's most valuable product may not be experiencing the growth expected, particularly in relation to its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. However, the total revenue still showed a slight increase of almost 4% from the same quarter last year, which might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising could be lower, while the probability of it falling could be higher, but not extremely so, due to the relatively modest decline in iPhone sales and overall revenue growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is a key product for Apple, missing analyst projections. However, the total revenue still saw a nearly 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This mixed result might lead to cautious investor behavior. The anticipation of AI payoff suggests potential for future growth, but the current sales figures might dampen short-term enthusiasm. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than falling in the immediate future.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's reported slight decline in iPhone sales in the December quarter falls short of analyst expectations and signals that the anticipated impact from AI software on their key product isn't materializing yet. Such underperformance in a core segment could dampen investor sentiment, particularly given high market expectations of Apple. However, the overall revenue growth, albeit modest, indicates the company isn't struggling and remains financially robust. This mixed signal suggests a cautious market reaction where a slight dip is more probable than a strong surge, but substantial volatility is likely.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The slight decline in iPhone sales and a miss on analyst expectations create downward pressure on Apple Inc.'s stock price, overshadowing the modest overall revenue growth. The anticipation of AI-driven growth has not yet materialized, contributing to investor concern. Many previous predictions reflect a consensus of caution surrounding the immediate impact of missed targets in Apple's core segment. Given these factors, a higher probability of stock price falling is expected, with less likelihood for a price rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment regarding the slight decline in iPhone sales (missing analyst expectations) is a major factor. While the overall revenue increase is positive, the market's forward-looking nature and the focus on iPhone sales as a key driver suggest a potential negative reaction. The lack of immediate payoff from AI further reinforces this concern. The previous rounds show a consistent leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, further strengthening this perspective. Specifically, all previous predictions estimate a higher probability of falling than rising, with estimates stabilizing around 0.3 for rising and 0.7 for falling. Given this consensus and the data, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect the strong negative bias, leaning closer to previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While overall revenue grew slightly, the key takeaway is the underperformance of iPhone sales, falling short of analyst expectations. This is particularly concerning as the iPhone is Apple's most profitable product. The anticipated boost from AI integration hasn't materialized yet, further dampening investor enthusiasm.  The consistent prediction from previous models of a higher probability of a price fall reflects the potential for negative market reaction.  While the overall revenue increase provides some support, the missed expectations on iPhone sales (Apple's core business) are likely to outweigh this positive in the short term, leading to a downward pressure on the stock price. The consensus among the previous models, leaning heavily toward a price drop, strengthens this assessment.  However, the possibility of a rise is not entirely eliminated, as the overall revenue increase is a positive signal, and the long-term potential of AI integration remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales, which is a critical revenue driver, missing analyst expectations. This could negatively impact investor sentiment, especially as the anticipated AI-driven growth has yet to materialize. However, the overall revenue increased by 4%, which might provide some offsetting positive sentiment. Given the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising, as the miss on iPhone sales is likely to weigh more heavily on investors' minds in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations. While the total revenue increased by almost 4% from the same quarter last year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment. The anticipation of AI-driven growth that has yet to materialize adds to the uncertainty. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than falling in the immediate future. However, the overall financial health of Apple and the long-term prospects tied to AI development could provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a mixed picture for Apple, with a slight decline in iPhone sales (a key revenue driver) but an overall increase in total revenue. The decline in iPhone sales and the miss on analyst expectations could lead to negative investor sentiment, while the increase in total revenue and the anticipation of AI payoff suggest potential for future growth. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising. However, the probabilities are not extremely high or low, reflecting the mixed signals from the news. Based on the analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.65, indicating a slightly higher likelihood of a decline due to the negative impact of the iPhone sales miss and the uncertainty surrounding AI-driven growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a minor decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product. Despite overall revenue growth, the miss on iPhone sales expectations may negatively impact investor sentiment. The market's anticipation of an AI-driven boost has not yet materialized, potentially adding uncertainty. Previous predictions show a consistent trend toward a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by similar reasoning. Considering the mixed signals and historical predictions, there is a moderate expectation of a stock price drop, though the long-term prospects tied to AI development may provide some support.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales during the December quarter, which missed analyst expectations, creates downward pressure on investor sentiment despite an overall revenue increase of nearly 4%. The market tends to react more strongly to the performance of key products rather than overall financial metrics, particularly when growth from anticipated AI initiatives has yet to materialize. Previous predictions show a consistent inclination towards a higher probability of stock price decline due to the missed expectations on iPhone sales, overshadowing the positive revenue growth. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The overarching sentiment from the news and previous predictions is leaning towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price. While the overall revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales compared to analyst expectations is a significant concern. The fact that AI isn't immediately boosting sales adds to the uncertainty. Considering that previous rounds consistently favored a higher probability of the stock falling, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect this trend, though acknowledging the mitigating factor of overall revenue growth. The consistency of previous predictions strengthens the likelihood of a negative market reaction in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While overall revenue increased slightly, the decline in iPhone sales, Apple's most important product, and the miss on analyst expectations is a significant negative.  The lack of a noticeable AI-driven boost further adds to the negative sentiment.  The consistent prediction across multiple models in previous rounds, showing a higher probability of a price fall, reinforces this negative outlook. While the overall revenue increase provides a small buffer, the market's focus on iPhone sales and the short-term nature of market reactions suggest that the negative news will likely outweigh the positive. The consensus among previous predictions, consistently leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, strongly supports this assessment.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, though the possibility of a rise is not entirely ruled out due to the overall revenue increase and long-term potential of AI integration.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While total revenue increased by almost 4%, iPhone sales, a critical revenue driver, declined slightly and missed analyst expectations. This miss is likely to weigh heavily on investor sentiment, especially as the anticipated AI-driven growth has yet to materialize. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities stabilizing around 0.3 for a rise and 0.7 for a fall. The consensus suggests that the negative impact of the iPhone sales miss outweighs the positive revenue growth in the short term. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales, which is a key revenue driver, and a miss on analyst expectations. While the total revenue increased by almost 4% from the same quarter last year, the decline in iPhone sales is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment. The anticipation of AI-driven growth that has yet to materialize adds to the uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the consensus from previous predictions, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight decline in Apple's iPhone sales in the December quarter, missing analyst expectations. While the total revenue increased by almost 4% from the same quarter last year, the decline in iPhone sales, which is Apple's most valuable product, is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment. The anticipation of AI-driven growth that has yet to materialize adds to the uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising. Based on the analysis of the mixed signals from the news and the trends in previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.7, indicating a higher likelihood of a decline due to the negative impact of the iPhone sales miss and the uncertainty surrounding AI-driven growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a slight decline in iPhone sales, which is the company's most valuable product. Despite overall revenue growth, the miss on iPhone sales expectations may negatively impact investor sentiment. The market's anticipation of an AI-driven boost has not yet materialized, potentially adding uncertainty.
