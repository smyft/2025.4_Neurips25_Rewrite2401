(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
