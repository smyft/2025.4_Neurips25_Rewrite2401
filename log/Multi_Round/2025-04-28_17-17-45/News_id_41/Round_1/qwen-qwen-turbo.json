(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report shows that the company has surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, indicating strong performance in the latest quarter. However, despite this positive news, there are concerns regarding unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that the stock may underperform in the near future. The overall industry outlook is also weak, with Apple's sector in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the stock price falling may be higher than the probability of it rising immediately following this earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. Firstly, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD. Secondly, the Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating anticipated underperformance based on unfavorable earnings estimate revisions leading up to the report. The industry Apple belongs to also has a below-average ranking. This suggests the sector might face headwinds. Management commentary in the earnings call will be critical. While beating estimates is positive, the analysts expectations are pessimistic. Therefore the current surprise may not continue moving forward. Factoring these elements into account, I believe that there is still a high chance of the stock falling. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple beat both earnings and revenue expectations for Q1 2025.  However, the Zacks Rank gives Apple a #4 (Sell) rating due to unfavorable estimate revisions before the earnings release, and the industry outlook is also negative (bottom 28% of Zacks industries).  While the earnings beat is positive, the negative Zacks Rank and weak industry outlook outweigh the positive impact of the better-than-expected results.  The management commentary on the earnings call will be crucial, but currently, the negative sentiments seem more dominant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported Q1 earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, which is typically a positive signal for stock price movement. However, the earnings surprise is relatively modest at 1.69%, and the company's stock has underperformed the market year-to-date. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests unfavorable earnings estimate revisions, which could dampen investor sentiment. The sustainability of the stock's price movement will depend on management's commentary during the earnings call. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to the earnings beat, but tempered by the negative outlook from Zacks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. The company's revenue also surpassed estimates, posting $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024. Despite this positive earnings report, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to unfavorable estimate revisions trend ahead of the earnings release. Historically, the stock has underperformed the market so far this year, losing about 4.4% compared to the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement will depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the existing negative sentiment and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple (AAPL) has surpassed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the stock. However, the company's shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year, and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests that the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. Additionally, the estimate revisions trend for Apple is unfavorable, and the industry outlook is not strong, as it is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Considering these factors, the positive earnings surprise may lead to a short-term price increase, but the overall outlook and industry performance suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the near future.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the Q1 quarter, showing strong financial performance. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests that near-term expectations are not favorable, and the shares might underperform the market. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
