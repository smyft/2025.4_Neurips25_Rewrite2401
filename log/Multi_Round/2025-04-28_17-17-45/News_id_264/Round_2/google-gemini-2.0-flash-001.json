(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock rebounds after report of iPhone sales slump in China\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) stock rebounded slightly Friday morning after Canalys reported a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, prompting Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings behind Huawei and Vivo.\n\nMorning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Seana Smith detail Big Tech's concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturer, as Apple plans to report quarterly earnings on Thursday, January 30.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n01:26\n\nApple stock falls after losing top smartphone spot in China: RPT\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:25\n\nApple's global iPhone sales decline 5% in holiday quarter: Report\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 days ago 06:55\n\nInvestors should 'get excited' about Meta if TikTok is banned\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:45\n\nBill Gates and Donald Trump Had a Three-Hour Dinner\n\nWSJ \u2022 1 hour ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's stock saw a slight rebound despite reports of a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is concerning. The long-term implications of losing market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the rebound indicates some level of optimism or short-term trader reaction. Additionally, with Apple set to report quarterly earnings soon, there could be some speculative trading activity leading to increased volatility. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities of the stock rising or falling are relatively balanced but lean slightly towards a potential fall due to underlying concerns about market share and sales performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the headline indicates a rebound after a report of slumping iPhone sales in China. This suggests a short-term positive reaction as the stock may have been oversold due to the initial negative news. However, the underlying report from Canalys points to a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, with Apple falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This continued competition in a key market like China is a long-term negative. The mention of potential Trump tariffs and upcoming earnings on January 30th add further uncertainty. Given these conflicting factors, while there's a short term rebound, the long-term trend suggests possible future struggle, therefore the probability of a stock price fall is greater than the probability of the stock price to increase. The video clips also point more towards negativity towards the company, which further lowers the chances of the stock price increasing. Considering all factors, a slight move upwards can be expected followed by a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While a drop in iPhone sales in China is negative and could pressure the stock price, the fact that Apple's stock *rebounded* slightly after the initial report suggests the market may have already priced in some of the negative impact.  The upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a major factor \u2013 the market will be looking for further details on sales performance, particularly in China, to determine the overall health of the business. The rebound suggests that investors are not entirely panicked, leading to a scenario where the impact of the negative news is possibly already discounted. The mention of tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty, but does not provide a specific directional indication.  Given the stock's rebound and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate the probabilities as below, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the potential for a positive earnings surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed impact on Apple's stock. On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for Apple, leading to a slip in rankings behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. This negative news could weigh on investor sentiment. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly, suggesting some resilience or perhaps investor focus on upcoming quarterly earnings. The rebound might also indicate that the market had already priced in the sales slump or that other factors (e.g., broader market trends, earnings anticipation) are offsetting the negative news. Given the mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rebounded slightly after a report of a slump in iPhone sales in China. However, the rebound was described as 'slightly', and the news also mentions that Apple slipped to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings. This mixed information suggests that while there might be some positive sentiment, the overall impact of the news could be neutral to slightly negative. The company's upcoming quarterly earnings report could also introduce volatility. Given this context, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.45 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline reports a rebound in Apple's stock price after a report of a slump in iPhone sales in China. This suggests that the market has already factored in the negative news and is looking for positive developments. The stock price rebounding slightly indicates that investors are still optimistic about the company's prospects, especially with quarterly earnings reporting approaching. However, the decline in iPhone sales in China and the loss of the top smartphone spot are significant concerns. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the market tends to focus on future earnings and growth potential rather than immediate sales figures.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news reports a slight rebound in Apple's stock price following a report of a sales slump in China, which led to Apple dropping to third place in smartphone sales rankings. While there is concern surrounding proposed tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturers, there's an upcoming quarterly earnings report. Given the stock has already rebounded partially, it suggests the market might be pricing in some of the negative news or expecting positive news from the forthcoming earnings report.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed situation for Apple (AAPL). Although the stock rebounded slightly after a report of a significant slump in iPhone sales in China, this slump leads to concerns about the company's market position, especially in a critical market where it now ranks third. The rebound suggests that some investors may be optimistic, perhaps anticipating that the negative news is already priced in or looking forward to the upcoming earnings report on January 30. However, the substantial decline in sales and competition from Huawei and Vivo remain concerning factors for long-term performance. Thus, while there may be a short-term positive reaction, the overall sentiment leans towards caution due to the sales report and future uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The reported 'rebound' suggests some initial negative news was already priced in, but the underlying slump in Chinese iPhone sales and the drop to third place behind Huawei and Vivo are significant concerns. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th adds another layer of uncertainty, as do potential Trump tariffs. Considering that previous predictions lean towards a slight decrease after the rebound, along with the slightly more dominant negative information, I am slightly leaning towards a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  A decline in Chinese iPhone sales is undeniably negative, pushing Apple to third place in that crucial market. However, the immediate stock rebound suggests the market may have already partially priced in this negative news.  The upcoming earnings report is a critical factor; positive results could outweigh the China sales slump, while disappointing results will likely exacerbate the negative sentiment.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, indicating considerable market uncertainty.  Considering the rebound, the upcoming earnings report, and the overall global impact of a Chinese sales slowdown, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price increase, but acknowledging significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, causing Apple to slip to third place in the Chinese smartphone market behind Huawei and Vivo. This could indicate weakening demand or increased competition, which may concern investors. However, the stock rebounded slightly after the initial report, suggesting that the market may have already priced in some of the negative impact or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as the upcoming quarterly earnings report. The rebound could also reflect short-term optimism or speculative trading. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly lean towards a potential fall due to the underlying concerns about market share and sales performance in a key market like China. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the immediate reaction to the news suggests a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed impact on Apple's stock. On one hand, the stock rebounded slightly after the report of a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, suggesting some resilience or optimism from investors. On the other hand, the underlying concerns about losing market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo, along with potential Trump tariffs and upcoming quarterly earnings, introduce uncertainty. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump and competitive pressures. However, the rebound indicates some level of optimism, which prevents a more decisively negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple, with a rebound in stock price after a report of slumping iPhone sales in China. However, the underlying concerns about losing market share to competitors and potential Trump tariffs add uncertainty. Considering the slight rebound and the upcoming quarterly earnings report, there's a possibility for positive news to impact the stock price. Other models' predictions suggest a range of opinions, from slightly bullish to slightly bearish. Given the mixed signals, I estimate the probabilities as balanced, with a slight lean towards a rise due to potential positive earnings surprise and the market's ability to price in negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed picture for Apple Inc. Despite the slight rebound in stock price following a report of a significant sales decline in China, there are ongoing concerns over market share losses to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty. Previous predictions show a range reflecting both cautious optimism and pessimistic outlooks, leaning slightly towards a potential fall in stock price due to underlying concerns. Considering all these factors, including historical predictions and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities need to account for both the short-term positive reaction and long-term market concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
