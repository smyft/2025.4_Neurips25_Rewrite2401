(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock rebounds after report of iPhone sales slump in China\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) stock rebounded slightly Friday morning after Canalys reported a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, prompting Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings behind Huawei and Vivo.\n\nMorning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Seana Smith detail Big Tech's concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturer, as Apple plans to report quarterly earnings on Thursday, January 30.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n01:26\n\nApple stock falls after losing top smartphone spot in China: RPT\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:25\n\nApple's global iPhone sales decline 5% in holiday quarter: Report\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 days ago 06:55\n\nInvestors should 'get excited' about Meta if TikTok is banned\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:45\n\nBill Gates and Donald Trump Had a Three-Hour Dinner\n\nWSJ \u2022 1 hour ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's stock saw a slight rebound despite reports of a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is concerning. The long-term implications of losing market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the rebound indicates some level of optimism or short-term trader reaction. Additionally, with Apple set to report quarterly earnings soon, there could be some speculative trading activity leading to increased volatility. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities of the stock rising or falling are relatively balanced but lean slightly towards a potential fall due to underlying concerns about market share and sales performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the headline indicates a rebound after a report of slumping iPhone sales in China. This suggests a short-term positive reaction as the stock may have been oversold due to the initial negative news. However, the underlying report from Canalys points to a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, with Apple falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This continued competition in a key market like China is a long-term negative. The mention of potential Trump tariffs and upcoming earnings on January 30th add further uncertainty. Given these conflicting factors, while there's a short term rebound, the long-term trend suggests possible future struggle, therefore the probability of a stock price fall is greater than the probability of the stock price to increase. The video clips also point more towards negativity towards the company, which further lowers the chances of the stock price increasing. Considering all factors, a slight move upwards can be expected followed by a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While a drop in iPhone sales in China is negative and could pressure the stock price, the fact that Apple's stock *rebounded* slightly after the initial report suggests the market may have already priced in some of the negative impact.  The upcoming earnings report on January 30th is a major factor \u2013 the market will be looking for further details on sales performance, particularly in China, to determine the overall health of the business. The rebound suggests that investors are not entirely panicked, leading to a scenario where the impact of the negative news is possibly already discounted. The mention of tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty, but does not provide a specific directional indication.  Given the stock's rebound and the upcoming earnings report, I estimate the probabilities as below, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the potential for a positive earnings surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed impact on Apple's stock. On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for Apple, leading to a slip in rankings behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. This negative news could weigh on investor sentiment. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly, suggesting some resilience or perhaps investor focus on upcoming quarterly earnings. The rebound might also indicate that the market had already priced in the sales slump or that other factors (e.g., broader market trends, earnings anticipation) are offsetting the negative news. Given the mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rebounded slightly after a report of a slump in iPhone sales in China. However, the rebound was described as 'slightly', and the news also mentions that Apple slipped to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings. This mixed information suggests that while there might be some positive sentiment, the overall impact of the news could be neutral to slightly negative. The company's upcoming quarterly earnings report could also introduce volatility. Given this context, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.45 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline reports a rebound in Apple's stock price after a report of a slump in iPhone sales in China. This suggests that the market has already factored in the negative news and is looking for positive developments. The stock price rebounding slightly indicates that investors are still optimistic about the company's prospects, especially with quarterly earnings reporting approaching. However, the decline in iPhone sales in China and the loss of the top smartphone spot are significant concerns. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the market tends to focus on future earnings and growth potential rather than immediate sales figures.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news reports a slight rebound in Apple's stock price following a report of a sales slump in China, which led to Apple dropping to third place in smartphone sales rankings. While there is concern surrounding proposed tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturers, there's an upcoming quarterly earnings report. Given the stock has already rebounded partially, it suggests the market might be pricing in some of the negative news or expecting positive news from the forthcoming earnings report.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
