This suggests a short-term positive reaction as the stock may have been oversold due to the initial negative news. However, the underlying report from Canalys points to a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, with Apple falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This continued competition in a key market like China is a long-term negative. The mention of potential Trump tariffs and upcoming earnings on January 30th add further uncertainty. Given these conflicting factors, while there's a short term rebound, the long-term trend suggests possible future struggle, therefore the probability of a stock price fall is greater than the probability of the stock price to increase. The video clips also point more towards negativity towards the company, which further lowers the chances of the stock price increasing. Considering all factors, a slight move upwards can be expected followed by a decline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple stock rebounds after report of iPhone sales slump in China\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
