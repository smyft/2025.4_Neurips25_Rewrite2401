(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Could Nvidia Unseat Apple as the Largest Company in the World in 2025?\nNews Content: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are the two largest companies in the world by market capitalization. While Nvidia is valued at roughly $3.38 trillion as of this writing and stands as the second-biggest business, Apple has a valuation of $3.46 trillion and is at the top of the heap.\n\nNotably, both of these tech giants are leaders in different corners of the hardware market. Nvidia is the leading designer of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center computing. Meanwhile, Apple leads the smartphone market with its iPhone lines and captures the majority of global operating profits from mobile phone sales.\n\nAs hardware-focused businesses, Apple and Nvidia's position atop the list of the world's most valuable companies looks even more noteworthy because software-focused businesses usually tend to be more profitable. But while Apple should be able to continue commanding very strong margins on its mobile hardware and other offerings in 2025, the stage could be set for Nvidia to deliver superior stock performance and take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" this year.\n\nNvidia's outlook for 2025 appears stronger than Apple's\n\nNvidia stock has been on an incredible run as rising demand for AI technologies has spurred massive sales and earnings growth for the company. The AI leader's share price rocketed 131.5% higher over the last year, and there were brief periods in 2024 when it had a higher market cap than Apple and stood as the world's largest company. While Nvidia's business has historically been shaped by cyclical demand trends in the semiconductor industry and will face tougher growth comparisons in 2025, its outlook still appears stronger than Apple's.\n\nApple is facing some performance headwinds in China -- its second-largest geographic segment by revenue. The mobile hardware giant hasn't been able to find a suitable Chinese partner to incorporate its Apple Intelligence platform into its latest iPhones. Due to regulations put in place by China's government, many products and services need to have a domestic operational partner in order to be sold in the country. As a result, the iPhone 16s in China do not have the Apple Intelligence platform and are facing a tougher competitive environment because of it.\n\nApple is also facing some regulatory pressures in the domestic market. In March of last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against the company alleging that it has created an illegal monopoly on the smartphone market by tying developers into its ecosystem through contractual restrictions. While it's possible that the DOJ under the new Trump administration will take a comparatively hands-off approach to antitrust matters and other issues compared to operations under the Biden administration, it's not clear the iPhone maker will benefit from this dynamic.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMargins and sales trends support Nvidia taking the crown\n\nOver the trailing-12-month period, Apple posted a gross profit of $180.7 billion on sales of $391 billion -- good for a gross margin of 46.2%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has posted a gross profit of $85.9 billion on sales of $113.3 billion across the same stretch -- representing a gross margin of 75.8%. So while Apple has generated far more overall sales and gross profit over the past year, Nvidia's gross profit margin is far higher. This distinction becomes even more significant when looking at recent sales momentum for both businesses.\n\nNvidia's revenue increased 94% year over year to reach $35.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Earnings per share for the period surged 111% annually to reach $0.78.\n\nFor comparison, Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year to $94.9 billion -- and its diluted earnings per share rose 12% to hit $1.64. Market data from Counterpoint Research suggests that Apple's iPhone unit shipments fell 5% year over year in the final quarter of 2024, so sales growth will be harder to deliver with its next financial report.\n\nIn order to return to stronger sales and earnings growth, Apple may need to deliver a new product or a software service offering with a more groundbreaking impact. The company's iPhone lines reliably serve up strong sales and great margins, but the smartphone market is saturated -- and growth has become harder to deliver.\n\nIn contrast, the demand outlook for Nvidia's GPUs continues to be very strong in 2025 amid ongoing AI infrastructure spending, and the rollout of the company's new Blackwell processors should support strong sales expansion and margins. With that in mind, I think there's a very good chance that Nvidia will take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" back from Apple and hold on to it for most of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple, including regulatory pressures in the U.S. and underperformance in the Chinese market, leading to concerns about future growth. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth due to strong demand for AI technologies and higher profit margins. Given Nvidia's current momentum and Apple's challenges, this raises the probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to rising. However, since Apple still has a strong market position and brand value, there is some probability of stock price increase. Overall, the sentiment appears more negative for Apple after this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While highlighting its current market capitalization lead and strong margins, it emphasizes significant headwinds: slowing growth due to a saturated smartphone market, challenges in China with Apple Intelligence integration, and an antitrust lawsuit. The comparison with Nvidia paints a bearish picture for Apple. Nvidia's higher gross profit margins, significantly stronger revenue and EPS growth, and a robust demand outlook for its GPUs driven by the AI boom suggest that Nvidia is better positioned for future growth. The mention of the iPhone's struggle in the last quarter of 2024 indicates potentially weaker sales figures. The Motley Fool's disclaimer about not recommending Nvidia currently is a slight counter-argument to a straight rise in NVDA price, but the overall tone implies a greater likelihood of Apple's stock underperforming relative to NVDA, hence, an increased chance of a fall for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI, contrasting it with Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures.  Nvidia's higher gross profit margin and revenue growth are emphasized. While the article suggests a higher probability of Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization, the impact on Apple's stock price is less straightforward. The article points out potential negative factors for Apple, but Apple still maintains massive revenue and a large market share.  Therefore, while the news is potentially negative for Apple relative to Nvidia, it doesn't necessarily predict a significant stock price drop for Apple.  A rise is less likely given the highlighted challenges, but a significant fall is also not a certainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a comparison between Apple and Nvidia, focusing on their market positions, growth prospects, and challenges. Apple faces headwinds in China due to regulatory issues and lack of a domestic partner for its Apple Intelligence platform, along with antitrust concerns in the U.S. Meanwhile, Nvidia is benefiting from strong demand for AI technologies, higher gross margins, and robust sales growth. Given these factors, the market may perceive Nvidia as having stronger growth potential in the near term, which could negatively impact investor sentiment toward Apple. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and consistent profitability might mitigate some of the downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Nvidia (NVDA) may surpass Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world by market capitalization in 2025. The article highlights Nvidia's strong outlook for 2025, driven by rising demand for AI technologies and its leadership in the GPU market. In contrast, Apple is facing performance headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the domestic market. Nvidia's gross profit margin is significantly higher than Apple's, and its recent sales momentum has been stronger. Based on this analysis, the news is more positive for Nvidia than Apple, which could lead to a higher probability of Nvidia's stock price rising and Apple's stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Nvidia's superior year-over-year revenue and earnings growth coupled with higher gross margins compared to Apple. Additionally, Nvidia's strong demand outlook for AI infrastructure and new processor rollouts suggest continued growth. Conversely, Apple faces regulatory pressures, challenges in China, and the increasingly saturated smartphone market. These factors collectively point towards a potentially stronger performance for Nvidia relative to Apple in 2025.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, particularly in foreign markets like China and ongoing regulatory pressures that may hinder future growth. In contrast, Nvidia's strong positioning in the AI market and superior growth metrics suggest it will continue to perform well. The prevailing sentiment leans negative for Apple as the competitive landscape intensifies and its sales momentum appears weaker than Nvidia. Overall, Apple's probability of price decline is greater given these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article predominantly presents a bearish outlook for Apple (AAPL). It emphasizes Nvidia's stronger growth prospects driven by AI demand and higher gross margins, contrasting it with Apple's headwinds in China, regulatory pressures, and a saturated smartphone market. Multiple models in the previous round converged on this negative sentiment, assigning a higher probability to a price decrease. Given this consensus and the continued relevance of the factors discussed (China challenges, AI dominance by NVDA, antitrust suit), a probability of falling stays higher. The consistency demonstrated with other round predictions strengthens the confidence in this assessment. Even though Apple is still profitable and has a strong brand, the negative signals appear to outweigh these positives in the context presented in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a comparative analysis of Apple and Nvidia, highlighting Nvidia's strong growth trajectory in the AI sector and Apple's facing several headwinds.  Nvidia boasts higher profit margins and stronger revenue growth, fueled by the booming AI market. Conversely, Apple faces challenges in China related to regulatory hurdles and the saturated smartphone market. The antitrust lawsuit in the US also presents a potential risk. While the article doesn't definitively predict Apple's stock price movement, the comparison strongly suggests a relatively better outlook for Nvidia. However, Apple's colossal market share, brand loyalty, and consistent profitability provide a buffer against a significant drop. The previous predictions show a general consensus towards a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling compared to rising, though the degree of probability varies.  Considering all this, I predict a moderate probability of Apple's stock price falling, with a smaller chance of a rise.  The overall situation is complex, and other unforeseen factors could influence the final outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a comparative analysis between Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), highlighting Nvidia's stronger growth prospects due to its leadership in AI and GPU markets, higher gross margins, and robust sales momentum. Conversely, Apple is facing significant challenges including regulatory pressures in the U.S., difficulties in the Chinese market with its Apple Intelligence platform, and a saturated smartphone market. While Apple still maintains strong brand loyalty and consistent profitability, the overall sentiment from the news suggests that Nvidia is better positioned for growth in 2025, which could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article compares Apple and Nvidia, highlighting Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI technologies and its potential to surpass Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalization in 2025. Apple faces challenges such as regulatory pressures in the U.S., underperformance in China, and a saturated smartphone market. Nvidia's higher gross profit margins and robust sales growth further emphasize its competitive edge. Given these factors, the news appears more negative for Apple, suggesting a higher probability of its stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article presents a comparative analysis between Apple and Nvidia, focusing on their market positions, growth prospects, and challenges. Apple faces significant headwinds, including regulatory pressures in the U.S. and China, a saturated smartphone market, and struggles with integrating its Apple Intelligence platform into iPhones in China. On the other hand, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by strong demand for AI technologies, higher gross profit margins, and robust sales expansion. Considering the trends and the information provided, the probability of Apple's stock price falling appears to be higher than the probability of it rising due to these challenges and the contrasting strong outlook for Nvidia.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Nvidia's superior year-over-year revenue and earnings growth coupled with higher gross margins compared to Apple. Additionally, Nvidia's strong demand outlook for AI infrastructure and new processor rollouts suggest continued growth. Conversely, Apple faces regulatory pressures, challenges in China, and the increasingly saturated smartphone market. These factors collectively point towards a potentially stronger performance for Nvidia relative to Apple in 2025.
