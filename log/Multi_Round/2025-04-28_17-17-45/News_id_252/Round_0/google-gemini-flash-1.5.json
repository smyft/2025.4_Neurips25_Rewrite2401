Consumer durables is a broad sector, and while Apple's products (iPhones, iPads, Macs) fall under this category, the headline doesn't suggest any particular impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. We assume that the market will continue to react based on other factors affecting Apple, such as product releases, earnings reports, economic conditions, and overall market sentiment.  The probabilities below reflect this lack of specific directional influence.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n"
