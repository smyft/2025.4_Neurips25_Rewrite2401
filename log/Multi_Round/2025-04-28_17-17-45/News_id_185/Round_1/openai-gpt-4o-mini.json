(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How to use options to play small caps, Apple earnings\nNews Content: Small caps (^RUT) have rallied about 18% over the last year. But it has been anything but a smooth ride. To hedge against the downside, BayCrest managing director David Boole recommends buying puts on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).\n\nLearn the details of Boole's small-cap call and how he thinks investors may want to play Apple's (AAPL) earnings in the video above.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\n\nThis post was written by Stephanie Mikulich.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news emphasizes how small caps have performed well recently, suggesting a positive market sentiment. Analysts are looking at options strategies for hedging long positions in small caps and expressing interest in Apple's upcoming earnings. However, the focus on options and hedging may indicate some caution among investors. Overall, with the positive momentum in the small caps and interest in Apple's earning potential, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising but also recognize the potential for volatility which could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings, implying an upcoming earnings announcement. Earnings announcements are typically volatile periods for stock prices, with the movement depending on whether the reported earnings and forward guidance beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. The news doesn't provide specific information about those expectations or any indication about whether Apple is likely to outperform or underperform. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned close to 50% with a slight preference to the rise, as Apple is historically a company that often beats expectations. The segment focusing on small caps and hedging strategies doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, although overall market sentiment can influence it. Given the rally in small caps, there may be some broader economic stability implied that could positively impact Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on small-cap stocks and using options strategies to hedge against risk in that sector.  It mentions Apple (AAPL) earnings briefly within the context of a video, but provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance or any factors that would directly influence its stock price. Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant in predicting Apple's stock price movement.  The probability of price movement should reflect the market's general expectation for Apple before this news, which is not provided here.  Assuming a neutral prior, we'll assign equal probabilities to price increase and decrease. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss small caps and hedging strategies related to the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), but only briefly mention Apple (AAPL) earnings without providing specific details or analyst expectations. Since the content does not disclose any material information about Apple's financial performance, guidance, or market sentiment, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely neutral or minimal. Without concrete bullish or bearish signals, the probabilities of a rise or fall remain balanced but uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly indicate a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The news focuses on small caps and hedging strategies, mentioning Apple's earnings but not providing specific details that would influence the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be neutral, with a slight bias towards the current market trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news article does not contain significant or direct information about Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) current financial performance, future outlook, or any events that would directly impact its stock price in a substantial manner. The mention of Apple is in the context of using options to play its earnings, which is a neutral trading strategy and does not inherently imply a positive or negative outlook for the company's stock. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's performance or outlook in the article, it's challenging to estimate a significant movement in the stock price based solely on this news. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the general market conditions and the neutral nature of the article's content regarding Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
