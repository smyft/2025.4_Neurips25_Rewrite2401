(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How to use options to play small caps, Apple earnings\nNews Content: Small caps (^RUT) have rallied about 18% over the last year. But it has been anything but a smooth ride.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news emphasizes how small caps have performed well recently, suggesting a positive market sentiment. Analysts are looking at options strategies for hedging long positions in small caps and expressing interest in Apple's upcoming earnings. However, the focus on options and hedging may indicate some caution among investors. Overall, with the positive momentum in the small caps and interest in Apple's earning potential, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising but also recognize the potential for volatility which could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings, implying an upcoming earnings announcement. Earnings announcements are typically volatile periods for stock prices, with the movement depending on whether the reported earnings and forward guidance beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. The news doesn't provide specific information about those expectations or any indication about whether Apple is likely to outperform or underperform. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned close to 50% with a slight preference to the rise, as Apple is historically a company that often beats expectations. The segment focusing on small caps and hedging strategies doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, although overall market sentiment can influence it. Given the rally in small caps, there may be some broader economic stability implied that could positively impact Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on small-cap stocks and using options strategies to hedge against risk in that sector.  It mentions Apple (AAPL) earnings briefly within the context of a video, but provides no specific information about Apple's expected performance or any factors that would directly influence its stock price. Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant in predicting Apple's stock price movement.  The probability of price movement should reflect the market's general expectation for Apple before this news, which is not provided here.  Assuming a neutral prior, we'll assign equal probabilities to price increase and decrease. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss small caps and hedging strategies related to the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), but only briefly mention Apple (AAPL) earnings without providing specific details or analyst expectations. Since the content does not disclose any material information about Apple's financial performance, guidance, or market sentiment, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely neutral or minimal. Without concrete bullish or bearish signals, the probabilities of a rise or fall remain balanced but uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly indicate a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The news focuses on small caps and hedging strategies, mentioning Apple's earnings but not providing specific details that would influence the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be neutral, with a slight bias towards the current market trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news article does not contain significant or direct information about Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) current financial performance, future outlook, or any events that would directly impact its stock price in a substantial manner. The mention of Apple is in the context of using options to play its earnings, which is a neutral trading strategy and does not inherently imply a positive or negative outlook for the company's stock. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's performance or outlook in the article, it's challenging to estimate a significant movement in the stock price based solely on this news. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the general market conditions and the neutral nature of the article's content regarding Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses small caps and options strategies for hedging against risk, with a brief mention of Apple's upcoming earnings. The lack of specific positive or negative information about Apple leads to an uncertain impact on its stock price. However, the overall sentiment around the small-cap rally may imply a generally stable economic environment, which could have a subtle positive influence on Apple. Analysts' opinions vary but generally show a slight bias towards a rise based on prior market performance. Thus, I estimate a modest probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a significant probability of falling due to the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on small caps and mentions Apple's earnings in passing, within the context of options strategies. There's no specific information provided about Apple's performance, expectations or future outlook that would directly influence the stock price. The previous rounds have relatively neutral assessments. Considering the general positive market sentiment indicated by the small-cap's rally but acknowledging the cautious hedging mentioned in the news, and considering a trend of convergence to neutrality in previous model predictions, I'll slightly decrease the probability of rise and increasethe probability of fall. Although no strong signal from recent news, the overall market volatility and the implied caution in options trading strategies warrants a slight downward adjustment from the round zero predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece focuses primarily on small-cap stocks and hedging strategies, mentioning Apple's upcoming earnings only briefly and without providing any specific information.  This lack of concrete Apple-specific news makes it difficult to assign probabilities significantly different from neutral. While the positive sentiment around small-cap stocks might indirectly suggest some overall market optimism that could favorably impact Apple, it's a weak signal.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities favoring a slight increase in Apple's stock price, but the reasoning behind these offers very little information to justify the degree of confidence.  Consequently, I'll lean toward a slightly higher probability of a rise, reflecting the general market optimism hinted at, and the slight collective bias among previous predictions (though with a greater focus on uncertainty). The lack of direct Apple-related information in the news makes any strongly weighted prediction inappropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on small caps and hedging strategies related to the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), with only a brief mention of Apple (AAPL) earnings. The mention of Apple's earnings is within the context of a video, and no specific details about Apple's financial performance or analyst expectations are provided. Given the lack of material information about Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are balanced, reflecting the neutral nature of the news regarding Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.525, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.475, Reasoning: The news headline and content briefly mention Apple's earnings but primarily focus on small caps and hedging strategies. There is no specific information provided about Apple's expected performance or factors that would directly influence its stock price. Given the neutral nature of the content regarding Apple and the lack of concrete bullish or bearish signals, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be balanced. However, considering the overall positive market sentiment indicated by the rally in small caps and the common interest in earnings announcements, a slight bias towards a rise is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article does not provide significant direct information about Apple's current financial performance or future outlook, but it mentions the company's earnings in the context of using options strategies. The focus on small caps and hedging suggests some caution among investors. Considering the neutral nature of the article regarding Apple and the lack of concrete bullish or bearish signals, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be balanced. However, given the historical performance of Apple and the slight preference for a rise observed in some of the previous predictions, a slight bias towards a rise can be considered. Thus, a probability of 0.52 for the stock price to rise and 0.48 for it to fall is assigned, reflecting a neutral stance with a minimal positive bias based on Apple's historical tendency to perform well and the broader market context.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses small-cap strategies and a general approach to hedging risk through put options. The brief mention of Apple's earnings does not provide concrete information or market expectations necessary to predict a clear directional movement in the stock price. Previous predictions suggest a range of opinions from slight upward bias to balanced probabilities, reflecting the current uncertainty around earnings announcements and market sentiment towards both small-caps and large caps like Apple. Considering the neutral stance of the news and the limited market-specific detail, the inferred probabilities remain relatively neutral.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
