(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The information presented in the news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on AI and suggests Apple\u2019s significant position within that context. However, recent analyst downgrades and a notable decline in iPhone shipments in China raise concerns about AAPL's near-term performance. The flat performance of AAPL since Cramer's comments and the historical volatility experienced by the stock further complicate the outlook. While there is optimism related to AI investments, these fundamental issues suggest a higher risk of price decline. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is estimated to be lower than that of a price fall, reflecting cautious sentiment in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, considers Apple as a core holding ('quarterback of your portfolio') due to its consistent performance. However, the article also notes that AAPL's stock performance has been flat recently (0.18%) following a significant decline of 14% from recent highs due to analyst downgrades and reports of declining iPhone sales in China. While the article touches on AI trends, it downplays the notion of Apple as a promising AI stock as a core theme. Cramer's comments from September 2024 portray Apple as reliable, while the article highlights more recent negative developments. Given the contradictory information, I am assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise. The negative near-term factors like downgrades and shipment concerns mentioned in the article may have a more immediate impact than Cramer's longer-term positive view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is mixed in its implications for Apple's stock price. While Jim Cramer, a well-known but not always accurate, investor expresses bullish sentiment, calling Apple the 'quarterback of your portfolio',  the article also highlights recent negative factors such as analyst downgrades,  a report of decreased iPhone shipments in China, leading to a 14% loss since September.  The positive sentiment is somewhat diluted by its inclusion in a broader discussion of AI stocks, where it's ranked only 4th in Cramer's estimations, suggesting other AI companies may offer better returns.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is lower than a simple bullish statement would suggest.  The overall picture indicates a relatively balanced outlook with neither significantly positive nor negative factors dominating.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio' due to its steady performance and historical resilience. However, the article also notes recent challenges, including analyst downgrades and a reported 17% drop in iPhone shipments in China, which have contributed to a 14% decline in the stock price since late December. While Cramer's endorsement and the broader AI narrative could provide some positive sentiment, the immediate negative factors (downgrades, weak China sales) may weigh more heavily on investor sentiment in the short term. The probability of a stock price rise is tempered by these headwinds, while the probability of a fall is supported by the recent negative trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's positive comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio'. Cramer emphasizes steady production and solid performance, comparing Apple's consistency to that of a reliable quarterback. While the stock has recently faced some challenges, including analyst downgrades and a report on declining iPhone shipments in China, Cramer's overall bullish stance could provide a positive outlook. However, the impact of the news on the stock price seems to be neutral or slightly positive at best, given that the stock has only added 0.18% since Cramer's comments. The probabilities are estimated based on the generally positive but not overly enthusiastic comments from Cramer and the recent stock performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses Jim Cramer's positive views on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential in the AI sector. Cramer refers to Apple as the 'quarterback of your portfolio', indicating a steady and reliable performance. Although the stock has been flat since Cramer's comments in September, with a negligible 0.18% gain, it had previously gained 16.5% between September and late December. The article also mentions analyst downgrades and a report suggesting a 17% fall in iPhone shipments in China, which could negatively impact the stock price. However, Cramer's endorsement and the company's position in the AI sector could contribute to a potential rise in stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.55 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.45.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit any significant upward movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bullish perspective on Apple Inc. (AAPL), referring to it as the 'quarterback of your portfolio', which suggests a view of steady performance and long-term value. However, recent challenges such as analyst downgrades and a significant decline in iPhone shipments in China have negatively impacted AAPL's stock, leading to a 14% drop since late December. The mixed signals present a cautious outlook, with the positive sentiment from Cramer's endorsement being tempered by the immediate negative factors affecting investor sentiment. Therefore, while there may still be some optimism surrounding Apple's position in the AI sector, recent declines and analyst hesitations suggest a higher probability of a price fall over a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Jim Cramer's 'quarterback' analogy suggests stability, the article also highlights recent downgrades, declining iPhone shipments, and flat performance since his comments. The previous round's predictions also reflect this mixed sentiment, with probabilities hovering near 0.5. Considering the negative factors weigh more heavily in the short term, particularly the confirmed news of shipment declines and analyst downgrades, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall. However, Cramer's positive long-term outlook and Apple's continued presence in discussions about AI prevent me from assigning a significantly higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Jim Cramer's bullish sentiment is positive, it's tempered by recent negative developments, including analyst downgrades and decreased iPhone sales in China.  The 14% decline since December and the relatively flat performance since Cramer's September comments suggest the market is currently more influenced by the negative factors than Cramer's long-term optimism.  While Cramer's positive comments could offer some support, the recent negative trends and uncertainty surrounding the AI sector's effect on AAPL seem more impactful in the short term. The previous predictions range from a 40% to 55% probability of a price rise, and a 45% to 60% probability of a price fall.  Considering this, a slightly more pessimistic outlook is warranted, reflecting the market's current sentiment. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Jim Cramer's endorsement of AAPL as the 'quarterback of your portfolio' and his bullish stance on AI highlight the company's strong market position and potential long-term resilience. However, recent analyst downgrades, a 17% decline in iPhone shipments in China, and a 14% drop in stock price since late December introduce significant short-term risks. While Cramer's influence and the AI narrative could stabilize or slightly boost investor sentiment, the immediate negative factors suggest a higher likelihood of continued downward pressure. The overall balance of positive and negative indicators leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer's bullish stance on the company's steady performance and reliability, while also noting recent challenges such as analyst downgrades and declining iPhone shipments in China. Considering the positive sentiment from Cramer and the company's position in the AI sector, but also taking into account the negative short-term factors, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated. The trend of others' predictions indicates a varying degree of bullishness and bearishness, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price fall due to the recent negative factors, while others see Cramer's endorsement as a positive factor. Given this balance of positive and negative factors, a moderate probability of a stock price rise is assigned, reflecting the potential for Apple's steady performance to outweigh short-term challenges, but also acknowledging the risks and uncertainties in the market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer portrays Apple as a reliable and steady stock, comparing it to a 'quarterback' in football terms, implying strong long-term value. However, recent factors such as analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone shipments have pressured the stock price. Cramer's bullish tone could potentially lift investor sentiment, but short-term challenges like supply chain issues and macroeconomic pressures could limit any significant upward movement. Taking into account the overall sentiment from previous predictions and the balance of positive remarks versus current negative signals, the probabilities appear to be fairly evenly split.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
