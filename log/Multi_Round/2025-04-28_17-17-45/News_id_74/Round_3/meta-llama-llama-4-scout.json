(AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. being a preferred stock pick by Kevin O'Leary, a well-known investor, which could improve investor sentiment towards AAPL. The increase in Bernstein's price target also indicates analysts' confidence in the stock, despite a competitive environment in IT hardware. Additionally, Apple has shown strong recent financial performance with increasing revenue and significant shareholder returns, suggesting stability. However, concerns about high valuations and the future of AI profitability might temper expectations. Overall, the positive mentions and analyst upgrades lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is overall neutral to slightly positive for Apple. While it highlights Kevin O'Leary's potential interest in Apple, it doesn't explicitly confirm it as a top pick. The article mentions Apple's strong financials and market position, along with a price target increase from Bernstein. However, it also acknowledges potential challenges in the IT sector and suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns. The discussion of TikTok divestiture has a negligible impact on Apple's stock. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the confirmation of Apple's strong financial position and positive analyst sentiment, despite the caveats.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, but this is not a strong indicator of future stock price movement.  While O'Leary's investment strategy is highlighted, focusing on quality, dividend-paying companies,  the article doesn't suggest a direct investment in AAPL by O'Leary.  The article also mentions positive factors such as Apple's strong Q4 2024 revenue, Bernstein's positive price target ($260), and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. However, these are largely already known factors and are balanced by the mention of Madison Investment's underweighting of Apple due to volatility and the assessment that other AI stocks might have greater short-term potential.  Therefore, the news itself provides only a small amount of new information likely to influence the stock price. The overall sentiment is mildly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The probabilities are skewed slightly towards a rise due to the positive revenue figures and maintained outperform rating, but the impact of this news alone is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and inclusion in a quality dividend ETF. The article also mentions a raised price target by Bernstein from $240 to $260, maintaining an Outperform rating, which signals confidence in the stock. Apple's revenue growth, shareholder returns, and operating cash flow are positive indicators. However, the note about Apple being volatile and underweight in some portfolios introduces slight uncertainty. Overall, the news is largely positive, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). O'Leary's investment strategy focuses on quality companies with strong financial performance, diversification, and dividend income. Apple's recent financial reports show a 6% increase in revenue and a strong balance sheet. However, the article also mentions that Apple ranks 4th on the list and that certain AI stocks may hold greater promise for higher returns. Additionally, the article quotes a hedge fund's comment that they are underweight on Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025. Despite his criteria focusing on quality companies with strong dividend yields, Apple meets these criteria well given its historical financial performance, stable balance sheet, and ongoing service offerings. Additionally, Apple's strong revenue performance, recent product releases such as the iPhone 16, and AI strategy provide a positive outlook. However, the volatility noted by Madison Investments and the potential risks associated with TikTok's operations in the U.S. introduce some uncertainties.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's potential inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks, which contributes positively to market sentiment. The mention of Bernstein raising its price target from $240 to $260 is a strong indicator of analyst confidence in Apple's financial prospects. Additionally, Apple's recent revenue growth and strong operating cash flow reinforce a positive outlook. However, concerns about high valuations, mention of volatility, and suggestions that other AI stocks might provide higher returns temper the overall positivity. Considering the combined factors of a strong analyst recommendation, good financial results, and the uncertainty highlighted, I estimate a moderately high probability of stock price rise, while acknowledging some risk, leading to a lower probability of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The previous predictions mostly lean towards a slight rise in Apple's stock price, citing positive factors such as inclusion in O'Leary's picks, strong financials, and raised price targets. However, they also acknowledge potential headwinds like valuation concerns, IT sector challenges, and the possibility of other AI stocks offering better returns. The trend seems relatively consistent across different models. Taking these factors into account, I will skew my prediction slightly more towards the positive side, considering the generally positive sentiment and Apple's established market position described in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is mildly positive for Apple, but doesn't contain any strong catalysts for significant price movement.  The mention of Kevin O'Leary considering Apple as a potential stock pick is positive, but it's not a confirmation of investment.  Positive factors include Apple's strong Q4 revenue, Bernstein's increased price target ($260, maintaining an 'Outperform' rating), and the launch of Apple Intelligence.  However, these are largely anticipated factors and are offset by Madison Investments' underweighting and the article's suggestion that other AI stocks may offer better short-term gains. The TikTok discussion is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but the new information is limited and unlikely to cause dramatic shifts.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.7 for a price increase, and weighing the mixed signals in the news, a probability of slightly higher than 0.5 for a price rise is deemed appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, which is a positive signal given his reputation and investment criteria focusing on quality, dividend-paying companies. Apple's strong financial performance, recent revenue growth, and shareholder returns are highlighted, along with a raised price target by Bernstein. However, the article also mentions volatility and underweighting by some hedge funds, as well as the potential for higher returns from other AI stocks. The TikTok discussion has minimal impact on Apple. Overall, the sentiment is mildly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and positive analyst sentiment. Bernstein raised its price target for Apple from $240 to $260, maintaining an Outperform rating. The company's recent financial reports show a 6% increase in revenue and significant shareholder returns. However, some concerns about high valuations and the future of AI profitability are noted. Overall, the positive mentions and analyst upgrades lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While O'Leary's investment strategy and Apple's strong financial performance are positive indicators, the article also mentions that Apple ranks 4th on the list and that certain AI stocks may hold greater promise for higher returns. Additionally, the article quotes a hedge fund's comment that they are underweight on Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of explicit confirmation of Apple as a top pick by O'Leary, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to Apple's strong financial position and positive analyst sentiment, despite the caveats. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend of slightly higher probability of a price rise, which I will take into consideration.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, aligning with his preference for quality companies with strong financial performance and consistent dividends. Bernstein has raised its price target to $260, indicating continuing confidence in the stock. Apple's recent strong revenue growth and shareholder returns are positive signs, reinforcing its attractiveness. However, Apple's ranking as the 4th preferred choice among O'Leary's picks and mentions of volatility from Madison Investments introduce some caution. Nonetheless, overall sentiment leans positively towards further stock price appreciation.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's potential inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks, which could boost investor sentiment and confidence in the stock. Bernstein's raised price target from $240 to $260 builds on this positive sentiment, indicating strong analyst confidence in Apple's financial prospects. Furthermore, Apple's recent revenue growth and significant shareholder returns also contribute positively. However, mixed signals about Apple's ranking in O'Leary's picks, concerns about high valuations, and the mention of volatility temper the overall outlook. Thus, there is a cautiously optimistic sentiment, leading to a higher probability that the stock price will rise, albeit with some risks acknowledged.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The predominant sentiment remains mildly positive, as seen in the trend of previous predictions. The news article, while not explicitly confirming Apple as O'Leary's top pick, still positions it favorably. Key positive factors include Apple's strong financials, raised price target by Bernstein, and initiatives such as 'Apple Intelligence'. Countering these are factors like Madison Investments' underweighting of Apple, volatility concerns, and the article suggesting possibly higher short-term gains from other AI stocks. Given the slightly positive sentiment and Apple's already robust position, the likelihood of a price rise is somewhat more probable than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is mildly positive for Apple, but lacks strong catalysts for significant price movement.  While the mention of Kevin O'Leary considering Apple as a potential stock pick is a positive sentiment boost, it's not a confirmation of a substantial investment.  Positive factors include Apple's Q4 revenue growth, Bernstein's increased price target ($260, maintaining an 'Outperform' rating), and the launch of Apple Intelligence. However, these are largely anticipated and are offset by Madison Investments' underweighting and the suggestion that other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns.  The previous predictions show a range from 0.55 to 0.7 for price increase, reflecting the mixed signals. Considering the overall sentiment and the relatively limited impact of this specific news, a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise seems reasonable.  The lack of a definitive endorsement from O'Leary and the acknowledgement of potential headwinds in the AI sector prevents a more bullish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, which is a positive signal given his reputation for investing in quality, dividend-paying companies. Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% revenue increase and significant shareholder returns, is emphasized. Bernstein's raised price target to $260 and maintained Outperform rating further bolster confidence. However, the article also notes that Apple ranks 4th on the list, mentions volatility from Madison Investments, and suggests other AI stocks may offer higher returns. The TikTok discussion is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Overall, the sentiment is mildly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and positive analyst sentiment. Bernstein raised its price target for Apple from $240 to $260, maintaining an Outperform rating. The company's recent financial reports show a 6% increase in revenue and significant shareholder returns. However, some concerns about high valuations and the future of AI profitability are noted. Considering the mixed signals and previous predictions from various models, which generally indicate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, I estimate a moderately high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.41, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, which could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. The article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, consistent dividend growth, and positive analyst sentiment, including a raised price target from Bernstein. However, it also mentions concerns about high valuations, volatility, and the potential for other AI stocks to offer higher returns. Considering these mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong financial position and positive analyst sentiment, despite the caveats.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.

Bernstein has raised its price target to $260, indicating continuing confidence in the stock. Apple's recent strong revenue growth and shareholder returns are positive signs, reinforcing its attractiveness. The news also discusses Apple's inclusion in a quality dividend ETF and mentions AI strategy launches, which contribute to the positive outlook. However, some caution is introduced by concerns about high valuations, mention of volatility, and the potential for other AI stocks offering higher returns. Overall, the sentiment is largely positive but not overwhelmingly so, influenced by the strong historical performance and analyst confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
