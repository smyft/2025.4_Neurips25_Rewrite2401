(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth, which could negatively affect investor sentiment. However, despite the competitive pressures in the market and mixed reviews on its AI initiatives, analysts suggest that Apple is less exposed to the challenges posed by new AI models compared to its tech peers. The general upward movement in U.S. stock futures, primarily driven by positive earnings from other tech giants, may also provide some support for Apple's stock. Therefore, while there are factors that could lead to a decline, the overall market trend and comparative resilience may buffer against large downward movements.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors influencing Apple's stock. Positive aspects include Baird's analysis suggesting Apple is well-positioned in AI without excessive spending and modest capital expenditure growth indicating strategic investment. However, negative factors are more prominent: tepid quarterly revenue growth expectations, intensifying competition in China (a key market), mixed-to-poor early reviews of Apple Intelligence, and potential sales dampening as a result. Overall, the negative sentiment outlined regarding Apple's growth, AI features, and major market performance outweighs the isolated positives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is positive, with futures pointing upwards and positive reactions to some tech earnings (Meta). However, Apple's situation is more nuanced. While they are less exposed to the AI spending concerns impacting other tech giants, tepid revenue growth is expected, and the reception to their AI initiatives has been mixed.  The Fed maintaining a wait-and-see approach on interest rates doesn't offer immediate support or headwind to Apple specifically.  Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is tilted slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, accounting for the potential negative impact of disappointing earnings and lukewarm AI product reception.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is less exposed to the AI spending pressures faced by rivals like Microsoft and Meta, as it leverages third-party data centers and focuses on consumer-facing products. However, the company is expected to report tepid revenue growth due to competition in China and mixed reception to its AI features. The overall market sentiment is slightly positive with futures higher, but tech earnings are under scrutiny. Given these factors, there is a balanced probability of the stock price moving either way.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall market sentiment and earnings reports from major tech companies. Apple's stock price movement is likely to be influenced by its upcoming earnings report, which is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth. The article highlights that Apple faces intensifying competition in its Chinese market and has relatively modest capital expenditures compared to its peers. However, Apple is also seen as less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model and is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without heavy spending. Considering these factors, the stock price may see a slight positive movement due to relatively positive outlook and less exposure to AI spending concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall market trend with US stock futures climbing after BIG Tech companies released their quarterly reports. Despite some concerns over AI spending, Microsoft and Meta Platforms' CEOs defended their investments in AI. Apple is due to report its quarterly revenue, which is expected to be tepid due to intensifying competition in the Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model and has been introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. The company's relatively modest capital expenditures and use of third-party data centers for AI work may also be viewed positively. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector as a whole, including Apple's earnings, Microsoft and Meta's defensiveness on AI spending, Tesla's efforts to slash costs and introduce cheaper EV models, and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. For Apple, the news indicates tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, the tepid growth expectation may weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. with expectations of tepid revenue growth and tough competition in the Chinese market, alongside mixed reviews on its AI initiatives. While Apple is less exposed to the challenges posed by new AI models compared to competitors like Microsoft and Meta, the overall sentiment reflects some caution due to expected disappointing earnings. U.S. market futures are positive, which might provide some support, but the factors against Apple\u2014a combination of lukewarm growth expectations and competitive pressures\u2014suggest a higher probability of a price decline. After comparing various predictions from different models, a consensus emerges indicating a greater likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Considering the previous rounds' predictions and reasoning, the stock price of Apple (AAPL) is facing mixed signals. The overall market futures are up, and some tech companies have shown positive earnings. However, Apple's expected tepid revenue growth due to competition in China and the mixed reception of their AI initiatives are significant concerns. While Apple might be less exposed to high AI spending risks compared to peers, the tepid growth expectations present a considerable downside risk. The Fed's wait-and-see approach adds further uncertainty. Taking all these factors and the previous predictions into account, I believe the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher as the lukewarm reception to AI and competitive pressure could weigh more heavily., and previous predictions trend to a slightly lower performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is slightly positive, with futures rising, boosted by positive earnings from some tech companies. However, Apple's situation is more complex.  While Apple's lower exposure to the AI spending concerns compared to its peers is a positive factor, the anticipated tepid revenue growth, intensifying competition in China, and mixed-to-poor reception of its AI features are significant negatives. The previous predictions show a wide range, with some models favoring a price increase and others predicting a fall. Considering the varied forecasts and inherent uncertainty, the prediction leans slightly towards a price fall, although not significantly so. The consensus seems to be that the overall market positivity may offer some support against large negative movements. Therefore, the probabilities aren't strongly skewed in one direction, reflecting the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include Apple's relatively lower exposure to AI spending pressures compared to peers like Microsoft and Meta, and its strategic positioning in consumer-facing products with generative AI. Additionally, the overall market sentiment is positive with U.S. stock futures climbing. However, negative factors include expectations of tepid quarterly revenue growth due to competition in China and mixed reviews of Apple's AI initiatives. The previous predictions show a slight tilt towards a negative impact, but the overall market trend and Apple's resilience provide some support. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
