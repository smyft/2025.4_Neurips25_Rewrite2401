(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around\nNews Content: When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive development for Apple as CEO Tim Cook is aligned with the incoming administration of Donald Trump, suggesting potential favorable conditions for the company. Close ties with the administration could lead to beneficial policies regarding tariffs and antitrust matters. However, this political maneuvering could also be viewed as opportunistic, and any volatility inherent in political transitions might affect investor sentiment negatively. Given the history of tech executives working with differing administrations, the overall impact is more likely to be favorable, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to its CEO's willingness to engage with a potentially pro-business Trump administration. Tim Cook's established relationship with Trump, potential influence on tariff policies (beneficial for Apple's manufacturing), and antitrust issues could all be positively addressed with an open channel to the White House. While political donations are normal, Trump's emphasis on loyalty suggests that proactive engagement could benefit companies. This suggests reduced risk and opportunity for influence with policy and regulation, leading to an estimated slightly higher probability of a stock rise than fall. However, the article also highlights potential downsides. Aligning with a controversial political figure can alienate parts of Apple's customer base, creating short-term volatility. The overall market sentiment and other company-specific news will play major roles, which are impossible to predict from this headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration and past contributions to his campaigns. While this might be seen as typical political engagement by large corporations, the article emphasizes Trump's past contentious relationship with tech leaders, implying that Cook's actions are aimed at mitigating potential future conflicts.  Trump's potential return to office could impact Apple through policy changes related to tariffs, antitrust issues, and overall business climate decisions.  While Cook's proactive approach might be viewed positively, there's substantial uncertainty about the actual policy outcomes under a Trump administration.  Therefore, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is warranted, but the impact is likely to be relatively modest, with a larger overall market influence playing a far greater role in the stock\u2019s movement. The probabilities below reflect this nuanced assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc.'s CEO Tim Cook, along with other tech leaders, is attending Trump's inauguration and contributing to his inaugural fund. This indicates a positive relationship between Apple and the incoming administration, which could bode well for the company in terms of favorable policies, tariffs, and antitrust matters. Historically, such political alignments can lead to positive market sentiment, as they reduce regulatory risks and may lead to business-friendly policies. However, the impact is likely moderate as the news is more about relationship-building rather than immediate tangible benefits.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses how tech industry leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are attending Donald Trump's inauguration and have made contributions to his inauguration fund. This indicates a positive relationship between Apple and the incoming administration. Given that Trump has historically had a good relationship with Cook, and considering the potential benefits of being in Trump's good graces, such as favorable policies on tariffs and antitrust issues, it's likely that Apple's stock price will be positively affected. However, the impact may be neutralized if investors do not see significant policy changes that directly benefit Apple. The overall tone suggests a cautious optimism, leading to a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple CEO Tim Cook will be attending Trump's inauguration and has contributed to his inauguration committee, suggesting a positive relationship between Apple and the Trump administration. This could potentially lead to favorable policies and treatment for Apple, such as reduced tariffs and antitrust scrutiny. However, the article also mentions that Trump has had a tumultuous relationship with other tech executives in the past, which could introduce some uncertainty. Given the potential benefits of a positive relationship with the Trump administration, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a shift in the tech industry's approach to the re-election of Donald Trump. Major tech CEOs, including Tim Cook from Apple, are attending the inauguration and donating to Trump's committee. While Trump has had a contentious history with some tech leaders, he is now seen as more pro-business, which could lead to potentially favorable policies for these companies. Although there is historical tension, the current alignment could benefit Apple through reduced tariffs and support on antitrust matters. However, this news is more about the industry's strategic positioning rather than immediate performance indicators.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
