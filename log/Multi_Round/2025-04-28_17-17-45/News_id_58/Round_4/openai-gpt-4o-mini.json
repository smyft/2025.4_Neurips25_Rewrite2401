(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment on Apple Inc. (AAPL), noting significant concerns such as disappointing earnings expectations, poor Chinese cell phone orders, slowing service revenue, and lackluster product sales. Cramer's statement about the anticipated disappointment suggests a negative outlook, which could lead to a decline in stock price. While he does recommend holding the stock long-term, the immediate market reaction is likely to be negative due to the surprising nature of the earnings warnings, increasing the probability of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he ultimately advises against trading the stock, emphasizing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical resilience. His charitable trust's success with Apple reinforces the idea that long-term holding is preferable. Also Cramer discussed market uncertainty factors beyond Apple's specifics(earnings season, Federal Reserve's decision and Personal Consumption Expenditures(PCE), this adds to the unpredictable situation of the market affecting stock movement. The AI stocks' higher return compared to Apple also provides a slight negative outlook. Considering these competing factors, I believe the near-term probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but a significant drop is unlikely due to Cramer's overall positive long-term view. The Fed meeting could be a positive catalyst if it decides to cut the rate but the current market environment suggests otherwise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but not always accurate commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'. He cites expected weak performance across multiple segments (Chinese phone orders, AI integration, service revenue, Vision Pro sales, and lowered forecast).  However, he also advises against *trading* the stock and recommends holding, highlighting Apple's strong management and historical performance. This conflicting advice weakens the predictive power of his statement.  While his pessimistic outlook suggests a higher probability of a price fall, his recommendation to hold indicates a belief in the long-term prospects of the company, mitigating the immediate impact of negative news.  The market's reaction will depend on whether the actual earnings meet or exceed already lowered expectations. A slight negative reaction is more likely than a significant drop due to the preemptive negative sentiment already priced in.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The market sentiment appears mixed, with potential short-term negativity due to earnings disappointment but long-term confidence in the company's fundamentals. Given this context, the stock may experience downward pressure in the short term but could stabilize or recover later.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about Apple Inc. (AAPL) characterizes the company's upcoming earnings report as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen.' He predicts a range of negative factors including horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year. Despite advising investors to hold onto the stock rather than trade it, his overall tone suggests a negative outlook for Apple's short-term performance. Therefore, based on this news, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's perspective on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as the 'most widely anticipated disappointment' he has ever seen. However, Cramer advises against trading the stock and instead suggests holding onto it due to Apple's exceptional management and control over its own future. This implies a long-term positive outlook despite potential short-term disappointment. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling because Cramer's advice to hold rather than trade suggests confidence in the company's long-term prospects. However, the anticipation of a disappointing earnings report could initially push the stock price down.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism and potential concerns from a well-known financial analyst, Jim Cramer, regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report. Cramer predicts a 'disappointment' with multiple factors including potential issues with Chinese cell phone orders, slow service revenue growth, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a downward revision to annual forecasts. Given these concerns and Cramer's advice to hold rather than trade the stock, it suggests a cautious sentiment among investors. This could lead to increased selling pressures on Apple\u2019s stock. However, considering Apple's historical stability and strong management, some investors may hold their positions, limiting the extent of the decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presented by Jim Cramer paints a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment' and highlighting significant concerns like weak Chinese cell phone orders, lower service revenues, and lackluster sales of new products. While Cramer provides a long-term optimistic view on the company's management and overall performance, he advises against trading the stock in the short term, which implies a more cautious market sentiment. Therefore, the immediate impact of negative sentiments and forecasts leads to a higher expected probability of stock price decline over an increase. Competing views among predictions show a majority lean toward a bearish outlook, reinforcing my assessment. Hence, I estimate a higher probability that AAPL's stock price will fall in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but ultimately negative signal for Apple (AAPL). Jim Cramer anticipates a 'widely anticipated disappointment' in the upcoming earnings, citing multiple potential weaknesses including Chinese cell phone orders, AI integration, service revenue, Vision Pro sales, and lowered forecasts. While he advises holding the stock due to Apple's strong management and potential for long-term recovery, the immediate market reaction is likely to be negative given the convergence of anticipating negative news across several different aspects. Also, many previuos rounds also preicts that the stock price is more likely to fall. While one model predicted that the price is more likely to rise, I think this is an outlier. The prediction in this round should largely take into account the other models predictions. A few of the previous models also predict the the uncertainty in the economy will also affect stock. This leads to the prediction that the stock price will be more likely to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While Jim Cramer predicts a significant near-term disappointment in earnings, citing various factors (weak Chinese sales, slow service revenue growth, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and lowered forecast), his advice to *hold* the stock rather than trade it suggests a belief in Apple's long-term fundamentals.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, some leaning heavily towards a fall, others toward a rise. The wide range highlights the uncertainty inherent in interpreting Cramer's statement.  His prediction of disappointment is already likely priced into the market to some extent, possibly mitigating the immediate impact of the actual earnings announcement. However, significant deviation from expectations, either positive or negative, could cause a volatile reaction. Considering the conflicting signals (negative short-term outlook, positive long-term outlook, overall market uncertainty) and the spread of predictions in previous rounds, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall due to the immediate disappointment but acknowledge the possibility of a rise driven by factors beyond this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with Jim Cramer highlighting significant concerns such as disappointing earnings expectations, poor Chinese cell phone orders, slowing service revenue, and lackluster product sales. Despite these negative factors, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The market sentiment appears to be leaning towards short-term negativity due to the anticipated earnings disappointment, but there is also a belief in the company's resilience and long-term growth prospects. Given this context, the probability of the stock price falling in the short term is higher than it rising, but not overwhelmingly so due to the underlying confidence in the company's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting potential disappointments in the upcoming earnings report, such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, slowing service revenue, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite advising investors to hold the stock long-term due to Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer warns of a 'widely anticipated disappointment.' This mixed message suggests a higher likelihood of short-term negative market reaction. However, the overall long-term positive view of the company mitigates the extent of the potential decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment ahead of its earnings report, highlighting potential disappointments such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. However, Cramer also advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's exceptional management and long-term potential. Considering the conflicting advice and the overall market uncertainty, including the Federal Reserve's decision and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising. The anticipation of a disappointing earnings report could initially push the stock price down, but Apple's historical stability and strong management may limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns from Jim Cramer regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report. His comments focus on multiple potential disappointments, including weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, and slowing service revenues. Despite his advice to hold the stock rather than trade it, the overall tone suggests a bearish sentiment and anticipates a negative market reaction. The convergence of expectations around disappointing earnings makes a price decline more likely in the immediate term. Although Cramer emphasizes the company's strong management and long-term success, the short-term bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statements regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report are overwhelmingly negative, predicting a \"widely anticipated disappointment\" across various segments. While he suggests holding the stock due to long-term potential, the immediate market reaction is likely to be bearish, given the multitude of concerns raised, which includes weak Chinese cell phone orders, slow growth in service revenue and disappointing projections on new products. Analyzing past predictions reveals a predominant expectation for a price decline, bolstering this assessment. Despite Cramer's view on Apple's financial standing in the long term, considering the negative sentiment from his own statements and previously made price predictions, it is more probable that the stock price will decrease in the near future. Therefore, these considerations will lead to predicting a negative movement on the Apple stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' suggests a high probability of a near-term price drop.  He cites several factors contributing to this expectation: weak Chinese sales, underwhelming AI integration, slowing service revenue growth, poor Vision Pro sales, and a lowered forecast. This negative outlook is reinforced by the majority of previous model predictions. However, Cramer's contradictory advice to *hold* the stock, rather than trade it, indicates some belief in Apple's long-term strength and resilience.  This long-term positive view, combined with Apple's historically strong performance and solid management, suggests that the potential drop may be limited and that a significant rebound is possible after the initial negative market reaction to the earnings announcement. The uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's actions and the PCE inflation data further complicates the situation. Considering all factors, I estimate a higher probability of a short-term price fall, but a less extreme decline than some previous predictions might suggest, with the possibility of a relatively quick recovery.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with Jim Cramer highlighting significant concerns such as disappointing earnings expectations, poor Chinese cell phone orders, slowing service revenue, and lackluster product sales. Despite these negative factors, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, emphasizing Apple's strong management and long-term potential.

The overall sentiment from previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, considering Cramer's advice to hold and the company's historical resilience, the decline is likely to be moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news and the predictions from previous rounds. Jim Cramer's bearish sentiment on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report highlights potential disappointments such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, slowing service revenue, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite advising investors to hold the stock long-term due to Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer warns of a 'widely anticipated disappointment.' This mixed message suggests a higher likelihood of short-term negative market reaction. Considering the conflicting advice, overall market uncertainty, and the anticipation of a disappointing earnings report, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than rising. However, the historical stability and strong management of Apple may limit the extent of the decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a highly bearish sentiment from Jim Cramer regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL), predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment' with multiple negative factors including poor Chinese cell phone orders, slow service revenue growth, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and downward revisions to annual forecasts. While Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to Apple's strong management and potential long-term value, the prevailing negative expectations suggest a higher probability of immediate price decline. The market may react negatively to these concerns, especially given recent negative trends. However, there is a slight optimism due to Cramer's long-term recommendations, which might mitigate the extent of the decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The analysis of Jim Cramer's comments and the overall market sentiment suggests a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report. Cramer describes the upcoming earnings as 'the most widely anticipated disappointment', raising various concerns such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, a lack of growth from AI, slowing service revenue, and disappointing sales in new products. Although he advises holding the stock for long-term benefits, the immediate market reaction is likely to be bearish due to the accumulation of negative expectations. Most previous predictions indicate a higher probability of a stock price decline over a rise, supporting the conclusion that the short-term outlook is more negative. Despite affirming a long-term confidence in Apple's management and products, the anticipation of disappointing earnings overshadows this optimism, leading to a greater expected probability of a price fall in the immediate term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment from Jim Cramer, highlighted in the news and reinforced by prior predictions, heavily influences the probability assessment. Cramer's specific concerns\u2014weak Chinese cell phone orders, limited AI impact, sluggish service revenue, and disappointing Vision Pro sales\u2014point to a likely negative market reaction to Apple's upcoming earnings. While Cramer advises holding the stock long-term, the near-term headwinds appear substantial. This outweighs the confidence in sound management. Although some models consider Apple's historical resilience, the predominant expectation for a decline drives the prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings, coupled with his cited concerns about various product lines and market segments (Chinese orders, AI integration, service revenue, Vision Pro sales, and forecast), paints a largely negative short-term picture.  Although he advises holding the stock long-term, this advice is less relevant to immediate market reaction. The overwhelming consensus among previous models also points to a higher probability of a price drop.  While Apple's strong management and historical performance provide some buffer against a catastrophic fall, the anticipated disappointment is likely to outweigh these positive factors in the short term.  The market has likely already partially priced in some negativity, but a significant deviation from even the lowered expectations could trigger further price movement.  Considering all these factors, a price fall is more probable in the near term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
