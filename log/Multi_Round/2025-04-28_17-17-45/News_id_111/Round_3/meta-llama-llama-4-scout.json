It's cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.7. 2025 earnings are expected to rise 30.3%.\n\nBarrick Gold is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.\n\nShould a gold miner, like Barrick Gold, be on your short list?\n\n3.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights various stocks, including Apple Inc., which has seen a recent decline of 11.3% year-to-date and is rated as a 'Sell' by Zacks. Although Apple is a strong player in the market, it trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, suggesting it's not undervalued at this time. Additionally, the podcast does not provide positive catalysts for Apple's immediate price movement, leading to a moderate expectation of further declines or stagnation. Thus, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of the stock experiencing further downward pressure rather than a significant upward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article is a summary of a Zacks Market Edge podcast episode discussing five stocks, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple is mentioned alongside other companies, the article highlights some negative signals like a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). It also mentions the high forward P/E ratio, indicating it might not be a value stock despite the recent dip. This mixed sentiment, leaning slightly negative, suggests a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the immediate short term following the release of this news. This is due to the negative Zacks ranking.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The Zacks Market Edge podcast mentions Apple (AAPL) as one of five stocks discussed, noting its recent decline (-11.3% year-to-date), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1. While the podcast doesn't offer a specific prediction, the Zacks Rank and P/E ratio suggest a negative outlook. However, the mention in the podcast could bring some attention to the stock, potentially leading to a slight price increase related to increased trading volume. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, considering Apple's current valuation and Zacks rating. The probability of a price increase is lower due to these factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news content provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple is described as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a key holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which could instill confidence. On the other hand, the stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date, trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 (considered expensive), and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The high P/E ratio and Sell rating suggest potential overvaluation and downward pressure. However, the long-term reputation and brand strength of Apple might mitigate some negative sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not provide any directly positive or negative information specific to Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would significantly impact its stock price. The mention of Apple is part of a broader discussion about five favorite stocks, including Red Cat Holdings, Barrick Gold, Arista Networks, Nio, and Apple. For Apple, it's noted that the shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. The information provided does not offer any new or surprising insights that would drastically change investor perceptions. Therefore, based on this news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral, but slightly leaning towards a higher chance of the stock price falling due to the existing negative trends and rankings mentioned.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses five favorite stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and provides an analysis of each company's current stock performance and future prospects. For Apple Inc., the article mentions that the shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and are now only up 15.4% over the last year, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1 and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests that the stock may not be a strong buying opportunity at the moment, but if it falls further, it could be considered.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s recent stock performance and its current valuation metrics. The news highlights that Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and notes that it holds a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Despite these points, the article does not provide specific positive catalysts or reasons for a stock price rise in the near term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc. in the context of significant declines and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), highlighting a year-to-date drop of 11.3%. While Apple is regarded as a strong company with long-term potential, such as being part of the 'Magnificent 7' and a key holding for Warren Buffett, the current indicators suggest a lack of immediate positive catalysts. The high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 also raises concerns about overvaluation. The cumulative outlook appears to lean towards further downward pressure on the stock rather than significant upward movement, supported by the negative sentiment expressed in the podcast's context. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a decrease in stock price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed but slightly negative outlook on Apple (AAPL). The stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date, and Zacks has given it a 'Sell' rating. The high P/E ratio also suggests the stock is not undervalued. While being mentioned alongside other stocks in a podcast might generate slight interest, the negative indicators weigh more heavily. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a stock price decrease. Considering these factors, the probability of a price decrease remains higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece is a summary of a podcast discussing several stocks, including Apple.  The information presented regarding Apple is largely negative: a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), and a high P/E ratio of 30.1. While Apple's mention in the podcast might marginally increase trading volume, there are no positive catalysts presented to suggest an immediate upward price movement.  The consensus of previous models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the lack of positive news and the existing negative trends, a price fall is more likely in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a broader analysis of five favorite stocks. Key points about Apple include a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, an expensive forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). While Apple is recognized as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio, these factors are not immediate catalysts for a price rise. The absence of positive news or earnings surprises, combined with the Sell rating and high valuation, suggests a higher likelihood of continued downward pressure or stagnation. Previous model predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock falling, aligning with the negative sentiment from the Zacks ranking and current performance metrics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a list of five favorite stocks, noting its recent decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock might be overvalued, contributing to a negative outlook. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand, which could mitigate some of the negative perceptions. The mixed signals and overall negative trends mentioned (such as the Zacks Rank and the decline in stock price) suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of five favorite stocks, highlighting its recent decline of 11.3% year-to-date, a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), and a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1. These factors suggest potential overvaluation and downward pressure on the stock. However, Apple's long-term reputation and brand strength could mitigate some negative sentiment. Considering the mixed outlook and the absence of specific positive catalysts in the news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the provided information and the trends indicated by the Zacks Rank and P/E ratio.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc. and provides a generally negative outlook based on metrics such as a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and a year-to-date decline of 11.3%. Although Apple is a major player in the market, several indicators suggest that it is currently undervalued and not attractive from a short-term trading perspective. The previous predictions, especially from models that heavily weigh metrics, indicate a higher probability of stock price fall. While the long-term positive reputation and potential buying opportunities may support a slightly more optimistic view, the overall sentiment remains cautiously bearish.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. Additionally, the high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock may be overvalued. Although Apple is a well-known and established company, the lack of immediate positive catalysts in the news and the overall negative indicators point towards a higher likelihood of further price declines in the short term. The cumulative outlook remains cautiously negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The consistency in negative indicators for Apple (AAPL) across the provided news and previous predictions strongly influences this assessment. The persistent mention of a 'Sell' rating from Zacks, the significant year-to-date decline of 11.3%, and a high P/E ratio of 30.1 paint a picture of potential overvaluation and lack of immediate positive catalysts. While Apple's fundamental strength and inclusion in the 'Magnificent 7' offer some mitigating factors, the reiterated negative sentiment dominates the short-term outlook. The slight decrease in the probability of a rise from previous rounds reflects the continued absence of positive news and reinforcement of concerns by multiple sources.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news piece is a summary of a podcast discussing multiple stocks, including Apple.  The information presented on Apple is largely negative: a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), and a high P/E ratio of 30.1.  These factors strongly suggest overvaluation and potential for further decline. While the mention in the podcast might bring some slight increase in trading volume, this is unlikely to outweigh the negative sentiment. The consensus of previous models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the lack of positive news and the existing negative trends, a price fall is significantly more likely in the short term.  The previous predictions show a consistent downward trend in the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a broader analysis of five favorite stocks, highlighting its recent decline of 11.3% year-to-date, a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), and a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1. While Apple is recognized as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio, these factors are not immediate catalysts for a price rise. The absence of positive news or earnings surprises, combined with the Sell rating and high valuation, suggests a higher likelihood of continued downward pressure or stagnation.

(AAPL) as one of five favorite stocks, noting its recent decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The forward P/E ratio of 30.1 suggests that the stock might be overvalued, contributing to a negative outlook. While Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand, the mixed signals and overall negative trends mentioned (such as the Zacks Rank and the decline in stock price) suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. The consensus from previous model predictions also leans towards a higher probability of the stock falling, aligning with the negative sentiment from the Zacks ranking and current performance metrics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of a broader analysis of five favorite stocks. Key points about Apple include a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, an expensive forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).

(AAPL) as part of a broader discussion on five favorite stocks. Apple has shown a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, trades at a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and holds a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), which indicates it might be overvalued and has negative short-term expectations. Despite being a strong brand and part of the 'Magnificent 7,' the provided information supports a negative outlook.
