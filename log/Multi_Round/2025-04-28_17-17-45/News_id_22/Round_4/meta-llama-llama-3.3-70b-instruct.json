A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to a sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised competition fears among major players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. With Apple set to report earnings soon, investor sentiment is likely being influenced by the broader volatility in the tech market. While previous strong performance in AI investments is noted, the looming pressures from competition and expectations surrounding their own earnings introduce uncertainty. This may lead to more caution among investors, leading to a higher probability of price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Several articles highlight the competitive threat posed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has caused broader market concerns and even a tech stock sell-off, initially a negative signal. However, Nvidia has suggested that DeepSeek will need more of Nvidia's chips, suggesting that DeepSeek's advancement is real but not detrimental to chip leaders. Meta's success indicates market appetite for AI spends. Apple is gearing up to release its fiscal first quarter results. These earnings generate uncertainty until actually released. Considering the rise of AI development (as seen with Deepseek, Meta, and others), the possibility of positive announcements from Apple is present, as they have likely built some AI strategies of their own. Given the information available, a slightly higher chance of a positive (or no) movement is indicated by the recent events. However, the market is uncertain and dependent on what actually turns out for Apple. Therefore, a slight increase is expected, if anything.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its impact on the broader tech sector.  DeepSeek's competitive AI model caused a significant sell-off in tech stocks, including Nvidia, which lost a substantial portion of its market value. While Apple's performance is mentioned in relation to upcoming earnings, the overarching narrative centers on the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek and the uncertainty it creates for the industry. Microsoft's and Meta's reactions to the DeepSeek news (Microsoft's decline and Meta's investment in AI) further highlight the market's sensitivity to the development. The news doesn't directly mention any negative developments specific to Apple; therefore, a relatively neutral position is assumed until the earnings are released. The probability of a price increase is slightly lower due to the overall negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector. However, strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative market sentiment in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the broader impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on the tech sector, including a sell-off in tech stocks and concerns over AI competition. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies awaiting earnings results, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or outlook. The uncertainty surrounding the tech sector due to DeepSeek's rise could create cautious sentiment, but without direct negative or positive news about Apple, the impact is neutral to slightly negative. The anticipation of earnings could lead to volatility, but the overall sentiment from the news does not strongly suggest a rise or fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the tech industry and its potential to disrupt the dominance of Big Tech companies. The article mentions that Apple's earnings are expected to be released soon, but does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or expectations. However, the overall sentiment of the article suggests that the tech industry is facing increased competition and uncertainty due to the emergence of new AI technologies. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is uncertain, but the negative sentiment towards the tech industry as a whole may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's AI model affecting the tech sector generally may create negative sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. However, Apple's strong financial position and upcoming earnings could counterbalance these broader market sentiments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for the tech sector due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a competitive AI startup, which has raised concerns among major players including Apple. While there is anticipation surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report, the negative sentiment in the broader market, triggered by the sell-off in related tech stocks, creates an environment of uncertainty. Although Apple's strong market position and potential initiatives in AI could support its stock, the prevailing fears in the sector weigh heavily on investor sentiment. This analysis leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news cycle presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The rise of DeepSeek and its impact on the tech sector is a headwind, potentially leading to investor caution. However, other factors are at play. Meta's positive earnings highlight the potential upsides of AI investment, which could be mirrored by Apple if its earnings reveal strong AI positioning. Nvidia's comment indicates that DeepSeek relies on Nvidia's components, helping balance against competitive fears. Previous predictions in round 0 were diverse, with some leaning towards a more bearish outlook due to DeepSeek's disruptive potential. However, other predictions saw potential for positive Apple earnings. Considering these factors and given the anticipation of earnings, there's inherent uncertainty that slightly favors a fall, though a very negative prediction is not assured. I am slightly more weighting the negative sentiment but not significantly due to counter-examples in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is dominated by the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the broader tech sector. This has created significant uncertainty and volatility, leading to a sell-off in many tech stocks. While Apple's upcoming earnings announcement is mentioned, there's no specific information directly affecting Apple's prospects.  The overall negative sentiment in the tech sector due to DeepSeek's competitive AI model weighs heavily on the probability of Apple's stock price rising.  However, Apple's strong financial performance (in previous quarters) and the potential for positive news during its earnings announcement introduce a degree of uncertainty that prevents a purely pessimistic outlook.  Considering the previous predictions, the consensus leans toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but the possibility of a price rise due to positive earnings remains.  The uncertainty surrounding earnings results makes the probability distribution relatively flat, but the prevalent market sentiment slightly tilts it toward a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has raised concerns about increased competition in the AI sector. While Apple's upcoming earnings report is mentioned, there is no specific positive or negative news directly impacting Apple. The broader negative sentiment in the tech sector, coupled with uncertainty around Apple's earnings, suggests a cautious outlook. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with a slight tilt towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall market volatility and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to a sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. This has raised competition fears among major players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Apple's upcoming earnings report could potentially be impacted by the broader market volatility and uncertainty caused by DeepSeek's advancements and the reactions of other tech giants. While there is no direct negative news about Apple, the overall sentiment suggests caution, with a slight lean towards a potential decline due to the competitive pressures and market sensitivity.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the tech industry and its potential to disrupt the dominance of Big Tech companies. While Apple's earnings are expected to be released soon, the overall sentiment of the article suggests that the tech industry is facing increased competition and uncertainty due to the emergence of new AI technologies. However, Apple's strong financial position and upcoming earnings could counterbalance these broader market sentiments. Considering the predictions from other models, there is a mixed sentiment towards the stock price movement, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to the negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector, while others predict a slight increase due to the possibility of positive announcements from Apple. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant disruptions in the tech sector due to the rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. The overall sentiment in the sector is negative, as reflected in the broad tech stock sell-off and concerns over AI competition. While Apple is set to release its fiscal first quarter results, the news itself does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or outlook. The anticipation of Apple's earnings introduces uncertainty. Previous predictions varied, ranging from slightly bearish to neutral. Considering the neutral position and mixed signals, alongside Apple's strong historical performance and upcoming earnings, the probability leans slightly towards a minor decline but remains somewhat balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to a sell-off triggered by the emergence of DeepSeek, a competitor in the AI space that has raised fears among major companies like Apple. The upcoming earnings report from Apple introduces uncertainty, with potential for positive or negative impacts. Overall, the prevailing sentiment is cautious, with a higher probability leaning towards a stock price decline, especially given the negative market climate surrounding AI competition. However, there is still a chance for a positive outcome if Apple's earnings exceed expectations, which historically has been the case for the company. The mixed signals from other models suggest that while there is some room for optimism, the current sentiment is slightly weighted towards a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The repeated emphasis on DeepSeek's disruption of the tech market and its potential impact on Big Tech companies, coupled with the mixed reactions from Microsoft and Meta, continue to weigh on Apple's stock outlook. The anticipation of Apple's earnings report remains a key factor, but the general negative sentiment in the sector, driven by DeepSeek, overshadows any specific positive news related to Apple. Previous rounds show models consistently leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the overall market volatility and competitive pressures even considering that this is the earnings week. I will also continue to lean towards to a price fall since recent news is heavily influenced by AI news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly focused on the negative impact of DeepSeek on the broader tech sector, causing a significant sell-off. While Apple's upcoming earnings are mentioned, the article lacks specific information about Apple's performance or outlook.  The pervasive negative sentiment surrounding DeepSeek and the broader AI sector creates a bearish environment.  Although previous predictions were mixed, with some models leaning towards a neutral or slightly positive outlook, the overall weight of the news points toward a higher likelihood of a price drop. The uncertainty surrounding the earnings release introduces some volatility, but the dominant negative sentiment heavily influences the probability estimation. The consensus from previous models also leans toward a higher probability of a price fall. I've therefore weighted the probability of a fall higher, reflecting the substantial impact of DeepSeek's emergence and the lack of positive news directly related to Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks, particularly due to the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about increased competition in the AI sector. While Apple's upcoming earnings report is mentioned, there is no specific positive or negative news directly impacting Apple. The broader negative sentiment in the tech sector, coupled with uncertainty around Apple's earnings, suggests a cautious outlook. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with a slight tilt towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall market volatility and competitive pressures. Apple's strong financial position and potential positive earnings could counterbalance some of the negative sentiment, but the prevailing uncertainty and sector-wide concerns weigh heavily.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised competition fears among major players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Apple's upcoming earnings report could potentially be impacted by the broader market volatility and uncertainty caused by DeepSeek's advancements and the reactions of other tech giants. While there is no direct negative news about Apple, the overall sentiment suggests caution, with a slight lean towards a potential decline due to the competitive pressures and market sensitivity. Considering the mixed predictions from various models, the consensus leans towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has raised competition fears among major players like Apple. While there is anticipation surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report, the negative sentiment in the broader market, triggered by the sell-off in related tech stocks, creates an environment of uncertainty. However, Apple's strong market position and potential initiatives in AI could support its stock. Considering the mixed signals and previous predictions, I estimate a slight lean towards a potential decline due to the competitive pressures and market sensitivity.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant disruptions in the tech sector due to the rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. The overall sentiment in the sector is negative, as reflected in the broad tech stock sell-off and concerns over AI competition. While Apple is set to release its fiscal first quarter results, the news itself does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or outlook. The anticipation of Apple's earnings introduces uncertainty. Previous predictions varied, ranging from slightly bearish to neutral. Considering the neutral position and mixed signals, alongside Apple's strong historical performance and upcoming earnings, the probability leans slightly towards a minor decline but remains somewhat balanced.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates significant volatility in the tech sector, primarily driven by the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has incited a widespread sell-off among major tech companies, including concerns for Apple. While anticipation for Apple's upcoming earnings report introduces some uncertainty, the broader negative sentiment surrounding increased competition and the sell-off in tech stocks suggests a cautious investor outlook. The majority of models lean towards a probability of decline, reflecting apprehension and market sensitivity, especially given the absence of clear positive indications specific to Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The narrative surrounding Apple is consistently overshadowed by the broader market anxieties stemming from DeepSeek's rise and its potential disruption of the tech industry. Although Apple's earnings are imminent, there's a consensus across previous predictions that the prevailing negative sentiment within the tech sector makes a price fall marginally more likely. The absence of specific positive news directly pertaining to Apple in the provided articles exacerbates this caution. The slight bounce-back I am predicting is due to the fact that the negative news has already been factored into the the predictions for 3 rounds in a row. Furthermore, other competitors such as Microsoft and Nvidia have made very positive statements of AI's benefits. I am also considering that the other model predictions might reflect some private and positive information that those models are privy to. Therefore I am slightly more optimistic than the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on the disruptive potential of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its impact on the tech sector. This has caused a significant sell-off, impacting major players like Nvidia.  While Apple's upcoming earnings are highly relevant, the prevailing negative sentiment and uncertainty created by DeepSeek overshadow any positive expectations.  Previous predictions from various AI models show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise.  While Apple's strong financial performance and potential for positive earnings announcements could counteract this negative sentiment, the market's general volatility and the lack of specific positive news regarding Apple in this particular news piece make a price drop more likely in the immediate term. The consensus from multiple rounds of predictions also points towards a bearish outlook, further reinforcing the probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news predominantly discusses the negative impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the tech sector, causing a significant sell-off in tech stocks. While Apple's upcoming earnings are mentioned, there is no specific positive or negative news directly impacting Apple. The broader negative sentiment in the tech sector, coupled with uncertainty around Apple's earnings, suggests a cautious outlook. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this mixed sentiment, with a slight tilt towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall market volatility and competitive pressures. Apple's strong financial position and potential positive earnings could counterbalance some of the negative sentiment, but the prevailing uncertainty and sector-wide concerns weigh heavily.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has raised competition fears among major players like Apple. The overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative, reflected in the broad tech stock sell-off and concerns over AI competition. While Apple is set to release its fiscal first quarter results, the news itself does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or outlook.
