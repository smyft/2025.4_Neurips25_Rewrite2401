A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns in the tech sector due to a sell-off triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised competition fears among major players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. With Apple set to report earnings soon, investor sentiment is likely being influenced by the broader volatility in the tech market. While previous strong performance in AI investments is noted, the looming pressures from competition and expectations surrounding their own earnings introduce uncertainty. This may lead to more caution among investors, leading to a higher probability of price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Several articles highlight the competitive threat posed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has caused broader market concerns and even a tech stock sell-off, initially a negative signal. However, Nvidia has suggested that DeepSeek will need more of Nvidia's chips, suggesting that DeepSeek's advancement is real but not detrimental to chip leaders. Meta's success indicates market appetite for AI spends. Apple is gearing up to release its fiscal first quarter results. These earnings generate uncertainty until actually released. Considering the rise of AI development (as seen with Deepseek, Meta, and others), the possibility of positive announcements from Apple is present, as they have likely built some AI strategies of their own. Given the information available, a slightly higher chance of a positive (or no) movement is indicated by the recent events. However, the market is uncertain and dependent on what actually turns out for Apple. Therefore, a slight increase is expected, if anything.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, and its impact on the broader tech sector.  DeepSeek's competitive AI model caused a significant sell-off in tech stocks, including Nvidia, which lost a substantial portion of its market value. While Apple's performance is mentioned in relation to upcoming earnings, the overarching narrative centers on the competitive threat posed by DeepSeek and the uncertainty it creates for the industry. Microsoft's and Meta's reactions to the DeepSeek news (Microsoft's decline and Meta's investment in AI) further highlight the market's sensitivity to the development. The news doesn't directly mention any negative developments specific to Apple; therefore, a relatively neutral position is assumed until the earnings are released. The probability of a price increase is slightly lower due to the overall negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector. However, strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative market sentiment in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the broader impact of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on the tech sector, including a sell-off in tech stocks and concerns over AI competition. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies awaiting earnings results, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or outlook. The uncertainty surrounding the tech sector due to DeepSeek's rise could create cautious sentiment, but without direct negative or positive news about Apple, the impact is neutral to slightly negative. The anticipation of earnings could lead to volatility, but the overall sentiment from the news does not strongly suggest a rise or fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the tech industry and its potential to disrupt the dominance of Big Tech companies. The article mentions that Apple's earnings are expected to be released soon, but does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or expectations. However, the overall sentiment of the article suggests that the tech industry is facing increased competition and uncertainty due to the emergence of new AI technologies. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is uncertain, but the negative sentiment towards the tech industry as a whole may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's AI model affecting the tech sector generally may create negative sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. However, Apple's strong financial position and upcoming earnings could counterbalance these broader market sentiments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
