(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news of Apple's partnership with SpaceX and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite connectivity into iPhones could be seen positively by the market, as it represents a significant technological advancement and expansion of service offerings. This partnership may enhance Apple's competitive position in the smartphone market against other brands, especially given the novelty of automatic satellite connectivity. However, there are risks associated with this move, such as potential market share loss for Globalstar, which has already seen a decline in its stock. Overall, the positive sentiment towards innovation and expanded capabilities likely outweighs potential negatives, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: This news is mixed but generally positive for Apple. It introduces a new feature (Starlink connectivity) that could be attractive to users, especially in areas with poor cellular coverage, giving Apple a competitive edge. The fact that it was kept secret and then rolled out suggests a strategic move to gain an advantage. The negative aspect is the potential dilution of Apple's existing Globalstar partnership, as Globalstar's stock already fell in response. However, the expanded connectivity options, combined with future capability for data and voice , suggests long term value. Furthermore, the support for iPhones on T-Mobile Starlink Beta test can encourage and support expansion to other carriers globally. Considering these points, it's more likely than not that this news will have a positive, but not overwhelmingly positive, effect on Apple's stock price. Investors will be intrigued by the added functionality, but also cautious about the impact on the Globalstar partnership. Given the negative reaction from Globalstar, it is possible for the stock price to fall on the news as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news of Apple integrating Starlink satellite technology into iPhones through a partnership with SpaceX and T-Mobile is potentially positive for Apple.  This expands Apple's satellite communication capabilities beyond its existing Globalstar partnership, offering a more advanced and potentially more widely usable service (automatic connection, future data/voice capabilities).  The surprise nature of the announcement and the positive reaction from Elon Musk on X suggest a potential for increased customer interest and brand enhancement. However, the current limited beta test and geographical restrictions (US only initially)  temper the immediate impact.  The negative impact on Globalstar's stock price suggests some investors view this as a competitive threat, albeit a limited one at this stage, which may somewhat dampen enthusiasm for Apple, but likely less than the overall positive sentiment.  Therefore, a slight increase in Apple's stock price is more probable than a decrease, but the effect is expected to be modest because of the phased rollout and current limitations of Starlink integration.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is expanding its satellite communication capabilities by partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink support into its iPhones. This move enhances Apple's competitive edge in satellite communication, potentially attracting more customers and reinforcing its ecosystem. The partnership with high-profile companies like SpaceX and T-Mobile could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the stock price of Globalstar, Apple's previous satellite partner, fell significantly, indicating potential concerns about competition. Overall, the positive aspects of this news likely outweigh the negatives for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones could have mixed effects on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the partnership enhances Apple's satellite communication capabilities, potentially increasing the value proposition of its devices. On the other hand, this move might cannibalize Apple's existing satellite service provided through Globalstar Inc., which saw its shares fall about 11% in premarket trading. Given that Apple's announcement of iOS 18.3 did not disclose the Starlink support and the beta test is minimal, the immediate impact might be neutral. However, the strategic partnership could lead to long-term benefits for Apple, potentially outweighing the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. partnering with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for Apple. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service.

Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could further increase the value proposition for Apple customers. However, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% drop in its shares. Overall, the news is likely to have a positive effect on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strategic collaboration between Apple and SpaceX to integrate the Starlink satellite network into iPhones. This collaboration broadens Apple's service offerings, potentially enhancing user experience and competitive advantage in connectivity features. While Globalstar shares fell after the news, suggesting market concerns, the positive aspect lies in Apple's expansion into innovative technologies, potentially attracting investor interest and boosting market sentiment.
