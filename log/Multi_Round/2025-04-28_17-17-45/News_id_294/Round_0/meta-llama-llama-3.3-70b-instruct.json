This kind of headline can lead to investor concern and potentially trigger a sell-off, causing the stock price to fall. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in potential downsides or that the news is overly pessimistic, which could limit the downward movement or even lead to a rise if the actual performance exceeds lowered expectations. Given the directly negative tone of the headline, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}"
