Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, is known to have significant investments in various companies, including Apple. However, without specific information on Berkshire Hathaway's current holdings or actions related to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low. Given that Berkshire Hathaway is a major investor in Apple, if the news were to imply a change in Berkshire's holdings, it could have an impact, but as it stands, it's neutral.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.05,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.05\n}\n```"
