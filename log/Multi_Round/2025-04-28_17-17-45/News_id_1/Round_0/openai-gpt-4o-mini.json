However, it also states that Wall Street's concerns may be overblown. Apple Inc. (AAPL), while indirectly affected, may not feel as significant an impact since it does not rely heavily on these specific AI models. Thus, investors might remain optimistic about Apple's future in the market, given its robust portfolio and brand loyalty. Consequently, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising as investors may interpret this news as a minor concern compared to Apple's overall stability.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7.
