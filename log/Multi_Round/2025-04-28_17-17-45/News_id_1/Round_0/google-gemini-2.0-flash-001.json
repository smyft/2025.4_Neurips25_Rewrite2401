Here\u2019s What Happens Next\\\" suggests a negative impact on the 'Mag 7' group of stocks, including Apple. While the article claims that Wall Street's concerns 'might be overblown,' the initial reaction is likely to be negative due to uncertainty around the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. This creates vulnerabilities for companies reliant on existing AI solutions. Apple's reliance on premium pricing and competitive AI creates concerns that may lead to investors re-evaluating current price-to-earning ratio. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a stock price fall, at least in the short term.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7.
