Apple (AAPL), while involved in AI, is not directly mentioned as being significantly impacted by this competitive threat in the provided snippet. The headline focuses the threat on a specific set of competitors, not Apple. Therefore, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Any price movement is more likely due to other market factors than this specific news.
