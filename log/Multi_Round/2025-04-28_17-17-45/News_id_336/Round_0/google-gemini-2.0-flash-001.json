If Apple is perceived as a major player in AI (through hardware, software, or services), this news could be positive as investors may see continued growth potential. However, if investors believe Apple is lagging in AI compared to other companies, or that the market is becoming overvalued due to AI hype, the news could trigger a slight sell-off. Without knowing the specific 5 AI stocks, or the reaction of investors, it's difficult to predict with high accuracy. The rise probability is slightly higher due to the general positive sentiment around AI but the potential for market correction due concentration is significant.
