      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Jumps 3.5% in Following Strong Quarterly Results\nNews Content: On Friday, The stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The positive premarket increase of 3.5% indicates strong investor reaction to Apple's quarterly results, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates. The outlook for growth in fiscal second-quarter sales suggests strengthening demand for iPhones, despite a slight decrease in sales. Additionally, the services division showed significant growth, further supporting the positive sentiment. Although there was a drop in iPhone sales compared to last year, the overall earnings beat and optimistic future projections outweigh potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities favor a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While iPhone sales were slightly down and missed analyst expectations, the overall quarterly results (both earnings and revenue) beat expectations. The guidance for next quarter's sales growth is also positive. The strong performance of the services division is a significant positive factor, demonstrating diversification and growth potential. The cautious approach to AI investment might be seen as either conservative or prudent. Given the initial 3.5% premarket jump, the better-than-expected overall results and guidance, offset to an extent by the iPhone sales miss, I anticipate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The market seems to be focusing on the positive aspects of the report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock jumped 3.5% pre-market following the release of its quarterly earnings. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the overall results exceeded analyst predictions in revenue and earnings per share.  The positive outlook for the next quarter, particularly the prediction of single-digit to mid-single-digit sales growth, is encouraging. The strong performance of the services division also contributes to a positive outlook. Although concerns exist about Apple's cautious approach to AI investments compared to competitors, the current news focuses on the exceeding financial performance and positive future projections. The initial market reaction (3.5% jump) suggests a strong positive sentiment.  However, a slight underperformance in iPhone sales and uncertainty about future AI investments introduce some risk. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledge the possibility of a fall, albeit less likely given the positive overall picture presented by the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive premarket increase of 3.5% for Apple's stock following strong quarterly results, despite a slight decline in iPhone sales. The company's earnings and revenue surpassed analyst projections, and the services division showed significant growth. The future outlook is optimistic, with anticipated sales growth and rising revenue from services. However, the slight miss in iPhone sales and cautious approach to AI investments could temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive earnings beat and strong services performance are likely to outweigh the minor negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported strong quarterly results, beating earnings and revenue projections. The company's fiscal second-quarter sales growth prediction is better than expected, and its services division achieved a significant year-over-year increase. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the results indicate resilience and potential for growth. Given the positive outlook and the company's cautious approach to AI investments, which might pay off in the long run, the stock is likely to perform well in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following the release of strong quarterly results, which exceeded analyst predictions. The company's services division showed significant growth, and the outlook for the next quarter is positive. Although iPhone sales declined slightly, the company's overall revenue and earnings per share surpassed projections. Given this positive news, it is likely that the stock price will continue to rise. However, the article also mentions that Apple is approaching AI investments cautiously, which might lead to some uncertainty. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article suggests a positive outlook for the company, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates strong quarterly results and better-than-expected guidance for future sales, suggesting a positive outlook. Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales, the overall revenue and earnings surpassed expectations, with growth in the services division. The cautious approach towards AI investments is also viewed positively as it indicates prudent financial management. These factors combined suggest a likely continuation of the positive market sentiment following the stock's premarket increase.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's quarterly results exceeded analyst expectations in both earnings per share and revenue, leading to a positive premarket increase of 3.5%. While there was a slight decline in iPhone sales and missed expectations, the strong performance in the services division, along with a positive outlook for future sales growth, indicates favorable investor sentiment. Despite some concerns regarding iPhone sales and cautious AI investments, the overall market reaction reflects confidence in Apple's growth potential. This suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is largely positive. Apple's earnings and revenue beat expectations, and their guidance for the next quarter is also positive. The services division continues to be a strong growth driver. While iPhone sales were slightly down, the overall picture is encouraging. The cautious approach to AI investments might reassure some investors. The initial premarket jump of 3.5% suggests a positive market reaction. Considering previous rounds' consensus on a fairly high chance of price increase, I will slightly increase the chance of price rise. Given round 0 showed a consistent high rating among all models, further emphasizing the positive sentiment, confidence in the rise is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but ultimately positive picture for Apple.  While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the overall financial results exceeded analyst predictions in both revenue and earnings per share.  The positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, coupled with the significant growth in the services division, strongly suggests continuing momentum. The cautious approach to AI investment, though potentially limiting short-term gains compared to competitors, is viewed by many as financially prudent and may be a positive factor in the long term. The immediate market reaction (3.5% pre-market jump) reflects strong positive sentiment. While the slight miss in iPhone sales and the cautious AI stance introduce some uncertainty and risk, the overall positive financial performance, strong services sector, and positive outlook largely outweigh these negatives.  Previous model predictions consistently favor a rise in stock price, further supporting this assessment. My prediction considers the balance between positive and negative factors and aligns with the overall market sentiment indicated by the pre-market jump and previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong quarterly results, with earnings and revenue surpassing analyst expectations.

Therefore, the probabilities favor a rise in stock price, with a focus on the company's strong quarterly performance and positive future projections.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news presents a largely positive picture for Apple Inc., with strong quarterly results exceeding analyst expectations in terms of earnings and revenue. The services division's significant growth and the company's optimistic outlook for the next quarter, including predictions of single-digit to mid-single-digit sales growth, contribute to a positive sentiment. Although there was a slight decrease in iPhone sales, the overall performance and future prospects seem to outweigh this negative. The cautious approach to AI investments might introduce some uncertainty but is also viewed as prudent management.

Although iPhone sales slightly declined and missed projections, the company's services division showed significant growth, indicating diversification and future potential. The guidance for the upcoming quarter suggests positive sales growth, which outweighs the concerns from iPhone sales dips. The cautious approach towards AI investments appears prudent, contributing positively to investor sentiment. Overall, the combination of positive earnings, optimistic outlook, and market reaction supports a higher probability of stock price rise over fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The general sentiment remains positive due to Apple exceeding earnings and revenue estimates, coupled with a positive sales growth outlook. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the strong performance of the Services division significantly contributes to a bullish outlook. The cautious AI investments are perceived as a sign of prudent financial management. Furthermore, a 3.5% premarket surge reinforces investor confidence. The consistent positive sentiment across previous rounds and models strengthens the argument for an increased likelihood of the stock price rising. Therefore, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results show a mixed bag. While exceeding revenue and EPS expectations is positive, the slight dip in iPhone sales and cautious AI approach introduce uncertainty.  The 3.5% pre-market jump reflects immediate positive market sentiment, largely driven by the overall earnings beat and positive sales guidance. The strong performance of the services division also boosts confidence. However, the missed iPhone sales target and relatively conservative AI strategy might temper future gains.

Previous predictions from multiple models consistently favor a rise in stock price, with probabilities ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for a rise. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors, the overall market sentiment, and the consensus among previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's quarterly results exceeded analyst expectations, with earnings per share of $2.42 and revenue of $124.3 billion. Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion in the previous year, the services division showed significant growth with a year-over-year increase of $26.34 billion. The company predicts single-digit to mid-single-digit sales growth for the fiscal second quarter, which is better than analysts predicted. The initial 3.5% premarket increase in stock price reflects strong investor sentiment.
