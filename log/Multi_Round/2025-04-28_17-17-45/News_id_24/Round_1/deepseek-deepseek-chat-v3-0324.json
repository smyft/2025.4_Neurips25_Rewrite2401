(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Jumps 3.5% in Following Strong Quarterly Results\nNews Content: On Friday, The stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The positive premarket increase of 3.5% indicates strong investor reaction to Apple's quarterly results, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates. The outlook for growth in fiscal second-quarter sales suggests strengthening demand for iPhones, despite a slight decrease in sales. Additionally, the services division showed significant growth, further supporting the positive sentiment. Although there was a drop in iPhone sales compared to last year, the overall earnings beat and optimistic future projections outweigh potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities favor a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While iPhone sales were slightly down and missed analyst expectations, the overall quarterly results (both earnings and revenue) beat expectations. The guidance for next quarter's sales growth is also positive. The strong performance of the services division is a significant positive factor, demonstrating diversification and growth potential. The cautious approach to AI investment might be seen as either conservative or prudent. Given the initial 3.5% premarket jump, the better-than-expected overall results and guidance, offset to an extent by the iPhone sales miss, I anticipate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The market seems to be focusing on the positive aspects of the report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock jumped 3.5% pre-market following the release of its quarterly earnings. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the overall results exceeded analyst predictions in revenue and earnings per share.  The positive outlook for the next quarter, particularly the prediction of single-digit to mid-single-digit sales growth, is encouraging. The strong performance of the services division also contributes to a positive outlook. Although concerns exist about Apple's cautious approach to AI investments compared to competitors, the current news focuses on the exceeding financial performance and positive future projections. The initial market reaction (3.5% jump) suggests a strong positive sentiment.  However, a slight underperformance in iPhone sales and uncertainty about future AI investments introduce some risk. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledge the possibility of a fall, albeit less likely given the positive overall picture presented by the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive premarket increase of 3.5% for Apple's stock following strong quarterly results, despite a slight decline in iPhone sales. The company's earnings and revenue surpassed analyst projections, and the services division showed significant growth. The future outlook is optimistic, with anticipated sales growth and rising revenue from services. However, the slight miss in iPhone sales and cautious approach to AI investments could temper some enthusiasm. Overall, the positive earnings beat and strong services performance are likely to outweigh the minor negatives, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported strong quarterly results, beating earnings and revenue projections. The company's fiscal second-quarter sales growth prediction is better than expected, and its services division achieved a significant year-over-year increase. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the results indicate resilience and potential for growth. Given the positive outlook and the company's cautious approach to AI investments, which might pay off in the long run, the stock is likely to perform well in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following the release of strong quarterly results, which exceeded analyst predictions.

Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales, the overall revenue and earnings surpassed expectations, with growth in the services division.
