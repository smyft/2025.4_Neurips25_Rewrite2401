(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?\nNews Content: In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It Time to Sell the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade to an underperform rating from Jefferies significantly impacts investor sentiment, especially given Apple's recent struggles with iPhone sales, particularly in China. The lack of strong consumer interest in Apple's AI features and the potential for missing revenue expectations further exacerbates concerns. Moreover, Apple's strong services revenue and business model provide some cushioning, but the seismic shift in analyst ratings is more likely to prompt selling pressure than buying interest. Thus, there is a higher probability of the stock price declining based on this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. A rare \"underperform\" rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments due to unconvincing AI features and disappointing sales in China due to the lack of AI approval, is a significant negative signal. The price target of $200.75 suggests downside potential. The potential risk stemming from the Alphabet antitrust case is also a concern. However, Apple's strong services business with high margins provides a buffer. The existing high valuation (P/E ratio) makes the stock more vulnerable to negative news. The fact that revenue growth is primarily driven by services, masking weakness in product sales, suggests potential concerns about the long-term health of the core product business. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise in the short-term. Note this is only short-term immediate impact, and a longer time horizon could yield different probabilities, as Apple has the potential for strong future growth. Given all positives and negatives, the estimation here errs on the side of caution. A news piece arguing to 'take some profits' on the stock usually indicates a short-term downward swing rather than further rapid ascent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies and concerns about weak iPhone shipments and AI feature adoption suggest potential downside, several counterarguments exist. Apple's strong services revenue growth, high margins, and historically resilient business model offer support.  The analyst's price target of $200.75 is still above the current price (context needed for precise comparison) which should temper immediate sell-offs.  The concerns about the Chinese market and the Alphabet antitrust case are significant long-term risks, but their immediate impact is uncertain. The article also mentions a multiple expansion in Apple's valuation which is a bearish factor. Considering this mix of positive and negative factors, a moderate probability of price fall is predicted, with a higher chance of price stability than a significant rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and lackluster consumer response to AI features, which could dampen investor sentiment. Additionally, challenges in China and potential risks from the Alphabet antitrust case add to the negative outlook. However, Apple's strong services revenue growth and high-margin business model provide some counterbalance. Given the rarity of such downgrades and the immediate negative sentiment, the short-term impact is likely negative, but the long-term resilience of Apple's business model may mitigate some of the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and disappointing revenue estimates. The analyst expects Apple's Q4 results and Q1 guidance to disappoint, and has set a price target of $200.75. Despite Apple's strong business model and growing services revenue, the downgrade and concerns about iPhone sales and AI features are likely to negatively impact the stock price. Additionally, the stock's high valuation with a forward P/E ratio of around 30 times and multiple expansion in the past few years make it vulnerable to a price correction. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis of the news article indicates that Apple Inc. has received a rare underperform rating from Wall Street analyst Jefferies due to weak iPhone shipment projections and a lack of consumer interest in the company's artificial intelligence features. The analyst expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates and has set a price target of $200.75. However, the article also notes that Apple has a strong business model, with a growing services revenue segment that has a high gross margin. The company's valuation has expanded in recent years, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio around 30 times. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling due to the negative outlook from the analyst and the potential risks to the company's revenue and profitability.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, coupled with concerns over weak iPhone shipments, lack of AI feature resonance, and potential disappointments in revenue projections. Despite these negatives, Apple retains a strong business model with robust service revenue and solid margins. However, the negative sentiment from an analyst downgrade and specific concerns about future growth prospects suggest a bearish impact on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
