(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently testing a key technical level (200-day moving average) and has experienced an 11% decline this year, indicating a bearish trend. Analysts suggest there is a risk of further declines if this level is breached, with $208 noted as a potential next support level. However, the upcoming earnings report could also provide a positive catalyst, potentially allowing for a rebound if results exceed expectations. Given the current bearish indicators, there appears to be a higher probability of the stock price going down in the immediate term, while the potential for a rebound exists if the earnings report is favorable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news paints a bearish picture for Apple. The stock has underperformed significantly, experiencing its worst start since 2008. It's approaching its 200-day moving average, a key support level. If this level is breached, technical analysts predict further downside, potentially to $208. While earnings could be a catalyst for a rebound, the overall sentiment leaning towards further decline cannot be ignored. The weakness in Apple has not materially impacted the S&P 500 as of yet but should other large technology stocks weaken in tandem, negative follow through for Apple could weaken the index and trigger a potential market correction. Taking into consideration the negative momentum and technical indicators, albeit with a potential earning-related bounce, I slightly favour the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with its stock price down 11% and nearing a key technical support level (200-day moving average).  Analysts are divided. While some see further declines, potentially to around $208 based on Ichimoku analysis, others believe the 200-day moving average could act as a buying opportunity for some investors.  The upcoming earnings report (Jan 30) is a significant catalyst, with potential for either a positive or negative reaction depending on the results. The overall market's resilience despite Apple's underperformance is a mitigating factor, but Apple's size and influence could still negatively impact the broader market if it continues its downward trend. Considering the bearish sentiment from the technical analysis and the uncertain outcome of the earnings report, the probability of a fall is considered slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s poor performance in early 2025, with an 11% decline, making it the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven and underperforming the S&P 500. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could lead to further declines, with a potential target of around $208. However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30 could serve as a catalyst for a rebound if results exceed expectations. The market's resilience despite Apple's slump suggests mixed sentiment, but the technical indicators and analyst warnings lean slightly bearish in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's stock performance, highlighting its worst start to the year since 2008 with an 11% slump in 2025. The stock is approaching a key technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could act as support but also risks a breakdown leading to further declines. Analysts suggest that if Apple falls below this level, it could signal more downside, potentially impacting the broader market. However, some traders may view this level as an opportunity to buy at a discount, which could lead to a rebound. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a significant catalyst that could influence stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has had a rough start to the year, with an 11% decline, making it the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. The stock is now flirting with its 200-day moving average, a key technical level that could signal more downside ahead if breached. Analysts quoted in the article, such as Katie Stockton, see further declines for Apple stock, with a potential target around $208. However, the article also mentions that the stock could rebound higher if Apple reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.'s stock has been experiencing significant declines, approaching a critical technical level known as the 200-day moving average. Analysts and experts believe that breaching this level could indicate further downside. Moreover, Apple's poor performance relative to the broader market and the recent trend suggests increased risk of continued falls. However, there remains a possibility that if Apple reports positive earnings, it could potentially reverse the downward momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple has had the worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% decline. The stock is nearing a critical technical support level at the 200-day moving average. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could lead to further declines, with a watch for a next support level around $208. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 may serve as a catalyst for potential gains if expectations are exceeded; however, the prevailing sentiment appears bearish given the technical indicators and overall market performance relative to Apple. Thus, while there exists the potential for a rebound, the immediate outlook suggests a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consistent bearish sentiment across previous predictions, highlighting the stock's poor performance, proximity to a key support level (200-day MA), and analyst expectations of further decline (to $208), reinforces a negative outlook. The upcoming earnings report remains a potential catalyst for reversal. Given the bearish momentum and the lack of significant positive counter-signals in both the news and previous predictions, the probability of a fall remains elevated, although slightly tempered by the potential for an earnings beat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds.  The 11% decline and its worst start since 2008 are substantial bearish indicators.  The proximity to the 200-day moving average, a key technical support level, adds to the downside risk. While a positive earnings report could trigger a rebound (and some analysts suggest the 200-day MA might act as a buying opportunity),  the prevailing bearish sentiment from multiple analysts, the significant underperformance, and the risk of a broader market correction fueled by Apple's weakness combine to suggest a higher probability of a fall in the short term.  The previous predictions from various models consistently favor the stock price falling, although the probabilities offered are relatively moderate, around 60%.  I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect the severity of the situation indicated in the news.  The upcoming earnings report is the key short-term catalyst, but the current momentum leans decidedly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in early 2025, with an 11% decline, making it the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven and underperforming the S&P 500.

The stock is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could lead to further declines, potentially to around $208. However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30 could serve as a catalyst for a rebound if results exceed expectations. Considering the bearish technical indicators and the potential for a positive earnings surprise, the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a higher chance of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's poor start to the year, with an 11% decline, making it the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven and underperforming the S&P 500. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level could lead to further declines, with a potential target of around $208. However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30 could serve as a catalyst for a rebound if results exceed expectations. Considering the bearish sentiment from the technical analysis and the uncertain outcome of the earnings report, the probability of a fall is considered slightly higher than the probability of a rise. Additionally, the predictions from previous rounds also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a probability of fall around 0.6. Taking into account the technical indicators, analyst warnings, and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant decline year-to-date, with an 11% drop making it the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. Apple's stock is nearing a key technical support level, the 200-day moving average. Analysts anticipate further declines if it breaches this level, with potential for a deeper pullback to $208 or potentially lower. Although there is potential for a bullish reversal if the upcoming earnings report exceeds expectations, the overall negative momentum and technical indicators point towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. The market's resilience so far despite Apple's slump indicates some underlying strength but does not mitigate the bearish pressure entirely.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Analyzing the current news regarding Apple Inc., the stock has experienced an 11% decline year-to-date, indicating a bearish trend that has resulted in its worst start since 2008. It is also nearing a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which could serve as a significant support level. Analysts suggest that breaching this level may lead to further declines, with the next target around $208. While the upcoming earnings report could present a potential catalyst for a rebound if results exceed expectations, the overall sentiment remains negative, leaning towards further declines rather than a rise. Previous predictions also reflect this bearish outlook, generally favoring a higher probability of falling, despite the potential for a positive earnings reaction. Taking these factors into consideration, it seems appropriate to assign a higher probability to the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The continuing downward trend of Apple's stock, indicated by the \"worst start since 2008\" and the stock approaching the 200-day moving average are strong bearish signals. While the upcoming earnings report offers a potential catalyst for a positive reversal, the consistent analyst warnings and previous predictions leaning towards a fall suggest the negative momentum is likely to continue. The market's resilience despite Apple's slump can't be ignored, but the risk of the stock breaking the 200-day average appears increasingly probable, justifying a higher probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds.  The 11% decline and its worst start since 2008 are strong bearish indicators. The proximity to the 200-day moving average, a key technical support level, increases the downside risk. While strong earnings could trigger a rebound, and some see the 200-day MA as a buying opportunity, the consistent bearish sentiment from multiple analysts and the risk of a broader market correction fueled by Apple's weakness suggest a higher probability of a fall in the short term.  The previous predictions consistently favor a price fall, although probabilities are moderate (around 60%). The upcoming earnings report is a crucial catalyst, but the current momentum is decidedly negative.  Considering this, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a fall compared to the previous round's consensus.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant underperformance in early 2025, with an 11% decline, making it the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven and underperforming the S&P 500.
