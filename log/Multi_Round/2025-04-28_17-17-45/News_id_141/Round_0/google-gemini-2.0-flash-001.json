Big Tech earnings are often catalysts for stock movement, especially for a company as significant as Apple. The focus on AI in these earnings could be a positive driver if Apple showcases advancements and future plans in this area. However, weaker-than-expected earnings or guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision also has a broad impact. If the Fed signals a more dovish stance (rate cuts sooner than expected), it usually boosts the market broadly, including Apple. A more hawkish stance (continued high rates) could negatively impact growth stocks like Apple. Given these mixed factors, the probability of a rise or fall is hard to say, but I am going to give a slight edge to a rise, but not by much. I am also going to assign it a 0.15 change of no change.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.50,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.50\n}\n```"
