A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, could significantly influence stock prices. The focus on artificial intelligence suggests potential positive sentiment if results meet or exceed expectations. However, uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision may create volatility. Given Apple's strong market position and potential positive reaction to earnings, there is a greater likelihood of a stock price rise, but the uncertainty from the Fed decision introduces risk. Therefore, there is a moderate probability of an increase and a somewhat lower probability of a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: This news piece highlights two major factors influencing Apple's stock: upcoming earnings and the Fed's interest rate decision. Big Tech earnings are often catalysts for stock movement, especially for a company as significant as Apple. The focus on AI in these earnings could be a positive driver if Apple showcases advancements and future plans in this area. However, weaker-than-expected earnings or guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision also has a broad impact. If the Fed signals a more dovish stance (rate cuts sooner than expected), it usually boosts the market broadly, including Apple. A more hawkish stance (continued high rates) could negatively impact growth stocks like Apple. Given these mixed factors, the probability of a rise or fall is hard to say, but I am going to give a slight edge to a rise, but not by much. I am also going to assign it a 0.15 change of no change.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings report, where AI will be a key focus.  Positive AI-related announcements could boost the stock price, while negative news or underwhelming results could lead to a decline. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor. A rate hike could negatively impact the overall market and Apple's stock, while a pause or smaller increase might be viewed more favorably.  Given the inherent uncertainties surrounding both the earnings report and the Fed's decision, assigning precise probabilities is difficult. However, considering Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive AI-related news, a slight upward bias is assumed. The probabilities are estimations and don't account for other market factors that might influence Apple's stock beyond this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights two major events that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: the upcoming Big Tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's earnings report will be closely watched, especially for insights into its performance in artificial intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment if results are strong. However, the Federal Reserve's rate decision introduces uncertainty; a hawkish stance could negatively affect tech stocks, including Apple, due to higher discount rates on future earnings. Given Apple's historical resilience and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive reaction if earnings exceed expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the Big Tech companies preparing to unveil their quarterly results, along with the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The earnings report from Apple could potentially have a significant impact on its stock price. However, the overall sentiment of the news is neutral, and the outcome of the earnings report and the Fed's rate decision are uncertain. Historically, earnings reports can lead to stock price increases if the company beats expectations, but also can lead to decreases if the company misses expectations. The Fed's rate decision could also influence the stock market, but its impact on Apple specifically is indirect. Given the neutral tone of the news and the uncertainty surrounding the outcomes, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.55 and the probability of it falling at 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings, which can have a significant impact on the stock price. The article also mentions the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, which can affect the overall market sentiment. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's earnings expectations or the potential impact of the interest rate decision on the company's stock price. Given the lack of specific information, I will assume that the earnings report and interest rate decision have an uncertain impact on the stock price. As a result, I will assign a probability of 0.5 to the stock price rising and 0.5 to the stock price falling, indicating a neutral outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the key companies mentioned in the Big Tech earnings scheduled next week. While the news does not provide specifics about what Apple may report, it is likely that AI will be a significant focus, which could influence investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also an important factor, as interest rates can affect borrowing costs and consumer spending. A rate increase might negatively impact technology stocks like AAPL, while a decrease could support them. Overall, the combination of earnings reports and the Fed decision creates uncertainty.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Given the upcoming earnings report from Apple Inc. and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, both factors present mixed implications for Apple's stock. The focus on artificial intelligence during the earnings could enhance positive sentiment if results meet or exceed expectations. However, uncertainty surrounding the Fed's decision introduces volatility. The previous predictions show a tendency towards slight upward bias but highlight the uncertainty stemming from the Fed. Considering all these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, reflecting overall positive sentiment sources like AI developments, offset by risks from the Fed's potential decision.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news highlights two crucial factors influencing Apple's stock: the upcoming earnings report and the Fed's interest rate decision. AI will be a central theme in Apple's earnings report, and positive announcements or strong AI-related performance could significantly boost the stock. Conversely, disappointing results would likely cause a decline. The Fed's interest rate decision also plays a crucial role; a dovish stance could provide general market support benefiting AAPL, while a hawkish stance might negatively impact the stock. In Round 0, predictions were mixed, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding these dual factors. Considering the slightly positive sentiments from the majority while taking all the previous results into consideration, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece highlights two major factors affecting Apple's stock: upcoming earnings and the Fed's interest rate decision.  The earnings report, focusing on AI, could boost the stock if results are strong, but weak results could lead to a decline. The Fed's decision introduces significant uncertainty. A hawkish stance (higher rates) could negatively impact Apple, while a dovish stance (lower rates or pause) would likely be beneficial.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a range of opinions, with a slight majority leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Fed decision and the potential for disappointing earnings results warrants a more cautious outlook than some of the earlier predictions. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors and the inherent unpredictability, I've adjusted the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price fall than some of the previous models, particularly considering the overall uncertainty from the combined impact of the earnings report and Fed decision.  The historical performance of Apple and the potential for exceeding expectations in AI, however, still provide a floor to the likelihood of a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights two key events that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: the upcoming Big Tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's earnings report, with a focus on artificial intelligence, could generate positive sentiment if results are strong, but negative sentiment if results disappoint. The Federal Reserve's rate decision introduces broader market uncertainty, with a hawkish stance potentially negatively impacting tech stocks like Apple. Given Apple's strong market position and historical resilience, combined with the mixed nature of the news (positive potential from earnings vs. uncertainty from the Fed), the probabilities are balanced but slightly favor a positive reaction if earnings exceed expectations. Previous predictions also suggest a slight bias towards a rise, though uncertainty remains high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights two major events that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: the upcoming Big Tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Apple's earnings report will be closely watched, especially for insights into its performance in artificial intelligence, which could positively influence investor sentiment if results are strong. However, the Federal Reserve's rate decision introduces uncertainty; a hawkish stance could negatively affect tech stocks, including Apple, due to higher discount rates on future earnings. Given Apple's historical resilience and the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a positive reaction if earnings exceed expectations. Considering the various predictions from other models, which range from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise and 0.3 to 0.5 for a fall, a moderate bias towards a rise seems reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The focus on artificial intelligence in the earnings reports could positively influence investor sentiment if results are strong. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's rate decision introduces volatility. Considering Apple's historical resilience, the mixed nature of the news, and the slight upward bias indicated by previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising slightly above 0.5. The previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, but most lean towards a slight increase or neutrality. Given this context and the general optimism around AI, I adjust the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
