(AAPL)\nNews Headline: IMAX Secures Netflix Deal for Exclusive 'Narnia' Theatrical Release, Stock Jumps\nNews Content: IMAX Secures Netflix Deal for Exclusive 'Narnia' Theatrical Release, Stock Jumps\n\nOn Friday, IMAX Corp (NYSE:IMAX) announced that it has agreed with Netflix, Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) to debut Oscar-nominated director Greta Gerwig\u2019s forthcoming film \u201cNarnia\u201d exclusively across the IMAX global theater network with a\u00a0two-week\u00a0run beginning Thanksgiving 2026.\n\nIt will premiere on Netflix at Christmas 2026, after months of negotiation between the companies, according to the Variety\u2019s report. IMAX stock gained after the update.\n\nAlso Read: Wipro Q3 Earnings: 24.5% Profit Jump, IT Services Margins Hit 12-Quarter High, Boosts Interim Dividend Payout to 70%\n\nNetflix mostly prefers to have its movies debut on its platform, particularly the more broadly commercial ones.\n\nHowever, in 2022, the streaming giant allowed \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d to run an exclusive one-week over 600 theatres.\n\nRival streamers like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) allowed movies to be released theatrically before reaching the streaming services.\n\nIn 2018, Netflix shared plans to produce series and film projects based on Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia.\u201d In 2020, Netflix tapped Gerwig. In 2023, Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d marked the year\u2019s biggest blockbuster, grossing nearly $1.5 billion globally.\n\nNetflix also remained focused on sports events, which likely drove 9 million subscriber additions in the holiday quarter, courtesy of the \u201cJake Paul vs. Mike Tyson\u201d boxing match, National Football League games, and the \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nAfter its password-sharing crackdown, The streaming giant added premium sports content to its platform to attract younger viewers and advertising dollars.\n\nBMO Capital\u2018s Brian Pitz expects Netflix\u2019s advertising-based video-on-demand (AVOD) monthly active users (MAUs) to reach 90 million by 2025, up from 70 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, backed by Squid Game 2 and WWE.\n\nPrice Actions: IMAX stock is up 3.09% at $23.08 at last check Friday.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding IMAX securing an exclusive theatrical release deal with Netflix for the upcoming 'Narnia' film suggests potential positive momentum for both companies involved. IMAX's stock reacted positively with a 3.09% increase, indicating investor confidence in this partnership. Although the news mainly pertains to IMAX, the implications for Netflix and related competitors, including Apple, highlight a strategic move in the competitive streaming and theatrical landscape, potentially affecting Apple's market perception. However, since the news does not directly involve Apple, the probability of a stock price rise or fall for AAPL is moderate. Therefore, I estimate a 40% probability of a rise and a 60% probability of a fall due to broader market reactions rather than direct impact from this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on IMAX (IMAX) and Netflix (NFLX). While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a company that, like Amazon, releases movies theatrically prior to streaming, it is not directly impacted by the specific news of the Narnia deal between IMAX and Netflix. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. Any movement up or down will mostly depend on overall market sentiment and other Apple-specific news, independent of the IMAX/Netflix deal. So based on this news alone the changes of stock price moving down or up are both 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on IMAX and Netflix's deal for the theatrical release of 'Narnia'.  While the news is positive for IMAX, and mentions Apple as a rival streamer that has released movies theatrically, there's no direct impact on Apple's stock price mentioned or implied in the article. The article highlights Netflix's strategic moves and its success, but these are not directly linked to Apple's performance or future prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this news is considered negligible. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be unrelated to this specific news event and driven by other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has positively impacted IMAX's stock. The mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is peripheral, noting that rival streamers like Apple allow movies to be released theatrically before streaming. There is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business or stock performance from this news. Therefore, the stock price of Apple is unlikely to be affected by this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it's worth noting that Netflix's decision to allow a theatrical release before streaming is a departure from their norm and might influence how other streaming services, including Apple TV+, approach content releases. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's core business, the stock price movement of AAPL is likely to be unaffected by this news. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article announces a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of the film 'Narnia', which led to a stock price increase for IMAX. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a rival streamer, it does not provide any direct information that would impact Apple's stock price. However, the article's discussion of Netflix's strategy and the success of its film productions may have indirect implications for Apple's streaming business. Given the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which directly benefits IMAX and could potentially attract more audiences to theaters, thus increasing their revenue. Since IMAX stock has already gained due to this news, it suggests positive investor sentiment towards the deal. There is no direct impact mentioned for Apple Inc., but the broader context of traditional media companies expanding theatrical releases might create cautious optimism among technology and entertainment sector investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix, which positively impacted IMAX's stock. While Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space, the news does not indicate any direct impact on Apple's current or future business. Given the lack of direct correlation between the news and Apple's stock price, the probabilities reflect the mixed sentiment observed in previous analyses. The overall sentiment is tempered by the fact that Apple is not directly involved, leading to a negligible expected impact on its stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for exclusive theatrical release, which directly benefits IMAX. While Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space that also does theatrical releases, the news does not directly impact Apple's business or future prospects. Previous predictions mostly assigned low probabilities of stock movement for AAPL. Considering the lack of direct impact and consistency in previous low estimates, I would assign low probability as well. Therefore, any movement in the AAPL stock would likely be driven by other factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix, with only tangential mention of Apple.  While Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming and theatrical release space, the news itself doesn't directly impact Apple's financials or strategic position. The previous predictions show a wide range, with many models assigning a very low probability of impact. The positive sentiment towards IMAX doesn't translate to a significant positive or negative impact on AAPL.  Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news. Therefore, the probability of a price change in either direction due to *this specific news* is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has positively impacted IMAX's stock. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a rival streamer that allows movies to be released theatrically before streaming, but there is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business or stock performance from this news. The previous predictions also indicate minimal to no impact on Apple's stock price due to this news. Therefore, the stock price of Apple is unlikely to be affected by this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news primarily focuses on IMAX and Netflix's deal for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia'. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as a rival streamer that has allowed movies to be released theatrically before streaming, similar to Netflix's recent actions. However, there is no direct impact or significant relevance to Apple's business or stock performance from this specific news. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's core business, the stock price movement of AAPL is likely to be unaffected by this news. The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are therefore considered low. Based on the overall neutral to slightly positive market sentiment reflected in others' predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has a positive impact on IMAX's stock. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is only mentioned as a rival streamer that releases movies theatrically before streaming, without any direct relevance to its business or stock performance. Considering the lack of direct impact and the indirect implications of the news on Apple's streaming business, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other Apple-specific news are more likely to influence the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has significantly benefited IMAX's stock price. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is only mentioned as a company that sometimes releases movies theatrically before streaming. While this news could indirectly influence perceptions about Apple's strategy in the streaming and theatrical market, there is no substantial evidence provided that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Most predictions from models indicate that the impact on Apple's stock price is negligible. Considering the broader market sentiment and the lack of direct impact, the probability of a significant stock price change for Apple Inc. is low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix, which positively affected IMAX's stock. While Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming space, the news does not directly impact Apple's business or stock performance. Most analyses indicate minimal impact on AAPL's stock from this news, leading to a consensus that any price movement would likely be driven by other factors. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of stock price increase and a slightly higher probability of a decrease due to the potential indirect effects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.12, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.08, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the deal between IMAX and Netflix. Apple is mentioned as a competitor, but there's no direct impact on Apple's financials or strategic position from this particular news. Most previous models assigned low probabilities for Apple's stock movement. While some models exhibit a slightly higher estimation for stock rising, the overall sentiment leans towards a negligible direct impact. Given the lack of specific information to suggest otherwise and the consensus of prior predictions, I'll maintain low probabilities, slightly factoring in general market volatility or indirect sentiments regarding streaming competition. Also, the small fluctuations up and down in previous predictions indicate that there might be some minimal factors that can lead to stock price changes, and the relatively stable beliefs from round 0 and round 1 might result to a more stable prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news focuses on a deal between IMAX and Netflix for a theatrical release of 'Narnia.'  While Apple is mentioned as a competitor in the streaming and theatrical release space, the news lacks direct impact on Apple's business or financial prospects.  The previous predictions consistently show low probabilities for Apple's stock price movement in response to this news.  Most models indicate a negligible impact, with probabilities for price rise or fall rarely exceeding 0.2.  The overall sentiment is that any movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific event and driven by other market factors. Therefore, the probability of a significant price change is low, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for an exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has positively impacted IMAX's stock.

The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are therefore considered low. Based on the overall neutral to slightly positive market sentiment reflected in others' predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but still within a low range.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which has positively impacted IMAX's stock.
