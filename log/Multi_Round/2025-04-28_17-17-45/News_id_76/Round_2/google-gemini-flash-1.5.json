(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition\nNews Content: By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, including delays in AI features, increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, and anticipated lower revenue growth. Analysts expect tepid sales for key products, particularly the iPhone. Additionally, external factors like a stronger U.S. dollar may further impact the company\u2019s performance. Given these negative indicators, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents several negative factors impacting Apple's financial performance. These include: 1) Slower AI integration compared to competitors, weakening its competitive positioning. 2) Decreasing market share in China due to competition from Huawei and other domestic brands. 3) Weaker expected growth rates for iPhone, iPad, and overall Q1 revenue compared to previous periods. 4) Negative currency impact from a stronger US dollar, potentially hindering sales growth. While the services business is performing well, and Mac sales are slightly up, the overall sentiment is bearish. The current analyst expectations are already relatively low (3.8% revenue growth), but the numerous headwinds suggest there is still significant downside risk. With all factors considered, probability of stock price falling looks more likely than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected revenue growth is positive (3.8%), it's significantly lower than the previous quarter and below analyst expectations.  This slowdown is attributed to several factors: slower-than-expected AI integration in iPhones, lagging behind competitors (especially in China), and a stronger US dollar affecting international sales. The decline in market share, particularly in China, is a major concern. However, the services segment is expected to continue strong growth.  The overall picture suggests a likely short-term negative impact on the stock price due to the weaker-than-anticipated sales and competition, but the strong services segment and Apple's brand loyalty provide a degree of support against a significant drop. The market has already partly discounted the negative news, with a 5% drop in January. Therefore, it's more likely the stock will experience a modest fall or sideways movement than a sharp decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including slow adoption of AI features, increasing competition in China, and a stronger U.S. dollar impacting international sales. These issues have already led to a 5% drop in Apple's stock price in January. The expected tepid revenue growth and weaker iPhone sales compared to previous quarters further suggest potential investor concern. While the services business shows stronger growth, it may not be enough to offset the negative sentiment around device sales and market share losses.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights challenges faced by Apple Inc. (AAPL) including delays in AI features, tough competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact Apple's quarterly revenue growth negatively. The article mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and iPhone demand has weakened, particularly in China. Given these negative factors, it is likely that the stock price will be negatively affected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's sales are likely to be hurt by delays in artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition, which has already led to a decline in Apple's global smartphone market share. Additionally, the strengthening US dollar may make it more difficult for Apple to report sales above consensus estimates. These factors are likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the services business is expected to post a significant increase in sales, which could partially offset the negative impact of the other factors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a slow roll-out of AI features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a weakening market share. These factors, combined with lower expected revenue growth and a strengthening U.S. dollar, indicate negative sentiment toward the company. Given these factors, it is likely investors will respond negatively, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news outlines significant challenges for Apple, including delays in AI feature implementation, increased competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers, and a decline in market share. Analysts expect slower revenue growth (3.8%) compared to previous quarters and iPhone sales growth to be particularly weak. The impact of a stronger U.S. dollar is also likely to hinder sales, especially in markets outside the Americas. While the services segment is expected to perform well, the negative sentiment surrounding device sales and competitive pressures lead to a predicted higher probability of stock price decline. This analysis is supported by previous predictions, which consistently show a bearish outlook due to the outlined challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans heavily towards a stock price decrease, primarily due to negative news regarding Apple's slow AI integration, increased competition in the Chinese market, and potential impacts from a stronger US dollar. The tepid revenue growth forecast further strengthens this bearish outlook. While the services sector shows promise, it's unlikely to fully mitigate the negative impacts. Given the consistent predictions in earlier rounds and the continued challenges outlined in the news article, the probability of a stock price fall remains high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a largely negative outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report.  Key concerns include slower-than-expected AI integration, falling market share in China due to intense competition, and the impact of a stronger US dollar on international sales. While the services sector shows continued growth, the anticipated weakness in iPhone, iPad, and overall revenue growth is significant.  The market has already reacted negatively, with a 5% drop in January.  While Apple's strong brand loyalty and the robust services sector offer some level of downside protection, the confluence of negative factors, especially the competitive pressure from Chinese brands and the AI lag, strongly suggests a higher probability of a stock price fall.  The consensus among the previous models also leans heavily towards a price decline.  Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to a price fall, though a complete collapse is unlikely due to the inherent resilience of the Apple brand and its services segment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting several challenges that are likely to impact the company's stock price negatively. These include delays in AI feature roll-outs, increasing competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers like Huawei, a decline in market share particularly in China, and the adverse effects of a stronger U.S. dollar on international sales. Analysts expect tepid revenue growth and weaker iPhone sales compared to previous quarters, which has already led to a 5% drop in Apple's stock price in January. While the services segment shows stronger growth, it is unlikely to fully offset the negative sentiment stemming from device sales and market share losses. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including delays in AI features, increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, and anticipated lower revenue growth. Analysts expect tepid sales for key products, particularly the iPhone. Additionally, external factors like a stronger U.S. dollar may further impact the company\u2019s performance. The consensus among analysts is bearish, with expected revenue growth of 3.8% for the quarter, which is well below the 6.1% growth in the previous quarter. The market has already partly discounted the negative news, with a 5% drop in January. However, considering the numerous headwinds and the overall negative sentiment, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The news article presents several negative factors impacting Apple's financial performance, including delays in AI features, decreasing market share in China due to competition from Huawei and other domestic brands, and weaker expected growth rates for iPhone, iPad, and overall Q1 revenue compared to previous periods. Additionally, the strengthening US dollar may further impact sales growth. While the services business is expected to post a significant increase in sales, the overall sentiment is bearish. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which have consistently indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative news, it's reasonable to conclude that the stock price is more likely to decline than rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a slow roll-out of AI features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a weakening market share. These factors, combined with lower expected revenue growth and a strengthening U.S. dollar, indicate negative sentiment toward the company. Given the consistent negative sentiments across multiple models as well as the recent 5% drop in Apple's stock price in January, the overall market perception leans towards a probable decline in the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Key factors contributing to this assessment include: significant slowdown in AI feature integration compared to competitors; a notable decline in market share, particularly within the crucial Chinese market; weaker-than-expected revenue growth projections for iPhones, iPads, and overall Q1 revenue compared to the previous quarter; and the negative impact of a stronger US dollar on international sales.  Although the services sector is expected to continue its strong growth trajectory, it's unlikely to completely offset the negative effects of the other factors.
