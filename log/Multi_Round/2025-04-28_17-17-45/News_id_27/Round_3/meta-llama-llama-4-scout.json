(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. highlights its position as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which could enhance investor confidence. However, concerns regarding declining iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges may weigh on the stock's performance. BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating suggests optimism despite lowered sales expectations. Overall, the positive association with Buffett and the company's strong revenue growth may support a higher likelihood of price stability or modest gains, but the potential for sales decline creates downward pressure. Thus, probabilities suggest a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Warren Buffett's long-held position in Apple, which is generally viewed favorably by investors. The company's strong Q4 2024 financial results and positive comments from BofA regarding margin resiliency and cash flow are also positives. However, there are negatives as well. BofA anticipates lower iPhone sales in the coming quarters due to macroeconomic challenges and delayed AI adoption. Furthermore, Greenlight Capital expresses concern about the overall market valuation, suggesting a potential risk to equities in general. The article mentions a shift towards defensive strategies by Buffett, accumulating cash, and also mentions better AI stock options elsewhere instead of AAPL. This suggests that while Buffett believes in the long-term viability of Apple, he may see better opportunities elsewhere, at least based on timing. Overall, the news paints a picture of a good company facing mixed headwinds and opportunities. Given these considerations, the impact on stock price is likely to be neutral with perhaps a slight downward pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position within Warren Buffett's portfolio and its long-term holding by Berkshire Hathaway. While this is generally positive, suggesting a vote of confidence from a renowned investor, the article also highlights concerns.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026, attributed to macroeconomic challenges and delayed AI feature adoption, present a counterpoint.  The article further mentions Greenlight Capital's concerns about overall market valuation and their preference for AI stocks over Apple, indicating a more cautious outlook from another significant investor. The overall sentiment is mixed, with positive long-term prospects tempered by short-term concerns regarding iPhone sales and broader market conditions.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted more towards a neutral outcome with a slightly higher chance of a price rise due to the long-term bullish signal from Buffett's continued investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, emphasizing its strong market position, revenue growth, and the potential of its AI services. However, it also mentions concerns about lower iPhone sales projections due to macroeconomic challenges and delayed adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite these challenges, BofA maintains a Buy rating due to margin resiliency and strong cash flow. The mixed signals from Buffett's defensive stance (hoarding cash) and the positive outlook from analysts suggest a balanced view. Given Buffett's historical influence and the company's fundamentals, the stock is likely to see moderate positive movement, but with some caution due to near-term headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's investment strategy and his holdings in Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the article mentions that Apple ranks 9th on the list of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, it also notes that BofA analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, but expect lower March quarter guidance due to macroeconomic challenges. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. However, it also mentions that Greenlight Capital is concerned about the overall valuation of the market and has maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. Given the mixed information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, due to the positive revenue growth and Warren Buffett's long-term investment in the company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While being one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks typically instills a sense of confidence among investors, concerns about lower iPhone sales projections due to macroeconomic challenges and delayed AI feature adoption introduce downward pressure on the stock. However, analysts maintain a Buy rating driven by margin resiliency and strong cash flow. With both positive and negative factors at play, it appears that there is a slightly greater chance of the stock price rising, reflecting investor sentiment surrounding Buffett's investment, balanced by caution from the sales outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which generally signals stability and investor confidence. However, concerns about potential declines in iPhone sales due to macroeconomic headwinds and delayed AI adoption are also cited. The fact that BofA maintains a 'Buy' rating despite lowered sales expectations provides some counter-balance. Previous predictions show a slight lean towards a price increase, but a wide range of estimates hints at uncertainty. Given this context, I'm sticking with a positive outlook benefiting from Warren Buffet's support, but also acknowledging the near-term concerns. The presence of consistent belief in stock price increase from others may indicate a positive trend and a positive outcome is relatively expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The fact that it's one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks is a strong positive, suggesting long-term confidence in the company.  Strong Q4 2024 revenue growth and BofA's Buy rating also contribute to a positive outlook. However, lowered iPhone sales projections, macroeconomic concerns, and Greenlight Capital's cautious market stance introduce significant downside risks.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, leaning slightly towards a positive outcome due to Buffett's continued investment and the company's long-term potential, but acknowledging the near-term headwinds.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from a 40% to 60% probability of a price rise, I'm placing my estimate slightly above the average, reflecting the positive impact of Buffett's long-term holding.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Given these considerations, the impact on stock price is likely to be neutral with perhaps a slight downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) position as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which generally boosts investor confidence. The company's strong Q4 2024 financial results, including a 6% revenue increase, and BofA's Buy rating due to margin resiliency and strong cash flow, are positive indicators. However, concerns about lower iPhone sales projections due to macroeconomic challenges and delayed AI feature adoption present a counterpoint. Additionally, Greenlight Capital's concerns about overall market valuation suggest potential risks. Considering these mixed signals, the probabilities lean slightly towards a stock price rise, driven by Buffett's long-term confidence and the company's financial health, but with caution due to near-term headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s position as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which could enhance investor confidence. However, concerns regarding declining iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges may weigh on the stock's performance. BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating suggests optimism despite lowered sales expectations. The mixed signals from Buffett's defensive stance and the positive outlook from analysts suggest a balanced view. Considering the historical influence of Buffett's investments and the company's strong revenue growth, the probabilities are estimated to be slightly in favor of a stock price rise. The predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most lean towards a slight increase or neutrality, considering both the positives and negatives presented in the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in Warren Buffett's portfolio and acknowledges its strong financial performance. Buffett continues to hold a considerable stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company's potential. However, concerns over iPhone shipments and market valuation challenges contribute to cautious optimism. Analysts remain optimistic due to resilient margins and cash flows. The mix of positive and negative indicators results in a relatively neutral outlook, with slight upward pressure due to Buffett's historical influence and strong financial metrics, while the near-term headwinds introduce some downward risk.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis reflects a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the recent financial news. While Warren Buffett's long-holding status in Apple typically instills confidence among investors, concerns over lower iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges create counterbalancing headwinds. BofA's mention of strong financial performance with a Buy rating suggests some positive momentum, especially with recent revenue growth and cash flow. However, the caution from Greenlight Capital regarding market valuations and Buffett's defensive cash hoarding indicates an environment of potential instability. Considering these factors, there is a slightly greater chance of a stock price rise due to Buffett's influence and Apple's solid fundamentals, but the possibility of a decline remains significant due to the outlined risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. It emphasizes Apple's position as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, suggesting investor confidence and long-term stability. Positive Q4 2024 results, strong cash flow, and BofA's reiterated Buy rating contribute to the bullish sentiment. However, lowered iPhone sales projections for 2025 and 2026 due to macroeconomic headwinds and delayed adoption of AI features introduce significant downside risks. Greenlight Capital's concerns about market valuation and their preference for AI stocks introduce caution. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, I lean towards a neutral outlook with slightly higher chances of stock rise. Given that many others consistently predict rising stock price, such signal might be a self-fulfilled prophecy.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The positive is Warren Buffett's continued significant investment, signaling long-term confidence.  Strong Q4 2024 revenue growth and BofA's maintained 'Buy' rating despite lowered iPhone sales projections also contribute positively.  However, concerns remain:  lowered iPhone sales projections due to macroeconomic challenges and delayed AI feature adoption introduce significant downside risk. Greenlight Capital's cautious market stance further adds to the uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting this mixed sentiment.  Considering the long-term bullish signal from Buffett's investment and the company's strong fundamentals, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but the near-term headwinds and market concerns are significant enough to keep the probability from being overwhelmingly positive. The trend of probabilities from previous rounds also suggests a slight upward bias.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company is one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which generally signals strong investor confidence. AAPL reported a 6% revenue increase in Q4 2024, and BofA maintains a Buy rating due to margin resiliency and strong cash flow. However, the article also highlights concerns such as lower iPhone sales projections due to macroeconomic challenges and delayed AI feature adoption, along with Greenlight Capital's cautious stance on market valuation. Considering these factors, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a stock price rise due to Buffett's continued investment and the company's strong fundamentals, but with caution due to near-term headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) position as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which generally boosts investor confidence.

The range of predictions from previous models (40% to 65% probability of a price rise) indicates a degree of uncertainty but a general inclination towards a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price.
