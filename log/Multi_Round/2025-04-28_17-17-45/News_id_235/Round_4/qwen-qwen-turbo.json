(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). Analysts predict positive growth for Big Tech companies, which could bolster investor confidence in AAPL. However, potential market volatility and unpredictability surrounding Trump's administration may introduce risks. Overall, the sentiment appears to favor a rise in AAPL stock due to the expected favorable policies for tech companies.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the potential impact of a second Trump term on various sectors. While it mentions that Big Tech leaders like Apple's CEO Tim Cook are trying to build relationships with the administration, and a Wedbush analyst predicts a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech with reduced regulation potentially benefiting the sector, it also highlights potential risks associated with Trump's unpredictable approach and potential trade wars. Tariffs, a common theme during Trump's previous administration, could negatively impact supply chains and increase costs, especially if levied on imports from China or other countries. The article provides conflicting signals, so the impact seems uncertain. This uncertainty leads to a more conservative prediction. Additionally, Apple's success is also predicated on a global economy so measures which negatively impact economies outside of the US could have negative consequences for Apple's sales.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the potential impact of a second Trump term on various sectors.  While the article highlights that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are attempting to gain favor with the administration through campaign contributions and that there's an expectation of less regulation and increased AI investment under Trump (which would generally be positive for tech), the analysis doesn't provide specific details directly impacting Apple's stock price. The overall market optimism mentioned might indirectly benefit Apple, but the article lacks concrete evidence suggesting a significant positive or negative impact specific to Apple.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the overall market outlook and the generally positive sentiment towards the tech sector, but acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector under the incoming Trump administration, with expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned alongside other Big Tech companies that are anticipated to benefit from these policy shifts. The sentiment among analysts and CEOs is positive, with Wedbush's Dan Ives predicting a 25% rise in tech stocks in 2025 due to reduced regulatory pressures and stronger AI initiatives. Given Apple's prominent position in the tech sector and its alignment with these favorable conditions, the likelihood of its stock price rising is high. There is no mention of specific risks or negative impacts on Apple in the article, which further supports a bullish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology. It mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on various sectors including tech due to lighter regulations and tax cuts expected under Trump's second term. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major player in the tech sector, is likely to benefit from a less regulatory and more optimistic environment. This aligns with the predicted positive momentum for Big Tech stocks mentioned by Wedbush's Dan Ives, expecting tech stocks to rise. However, there are risks associated with geopolitical factors and market volatility, so the assessment needs to consider both positive outlooks for tech and broader geopolitical tensions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector due to the expected policies from President-elect Trump that favor reduced regulation and support for AI investment. Analysts predict a favorable environment for Big Tech, which includes Apple (AAPL), leading to an anticipated significant rise in stock prices for this group. Conversely, the presence of potential market volatility and Trump's unpredictable nature could introduce risks, but the overall sentiment remains positive for AAPL based on the expert forecasts cited in the article. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to expected lighter regulations and increased AI investment under a second Trump term. Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO, are reportedly engaging with the new administration. While potential market volatility and trade-related uncertainty exist (especially tariffs), the dominant sentiment is optimistic for the tech sector. Previous predictions show a trend with most models assigning over 50% to the stock price rising. I'll adjust slightly leaning towards a higher probability weighing in that more models in the previous rounds have an uptrend on the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a Trump administration is expected to reduce regulations and increase investment in AI, generally positive for the tech sector, there are countervailing risks.  Trump's unpredictable nature and potential for tariffs, particularly impacting sectors like auto manufacturing which could affect the broader economy, introduces significant uncertainty.  Apple's global supply chain makes it vulnerable to international trade disputes. While the overall sentiment towards the technology sector is positive, the specific impact on Apple isn't clearly defined. The bullish predictions of analysts are balanced by the inherent risks associated with a Trump presidency and the possibility of negative macroeconomic consequences. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of probability from 0.55 to 0.8 for a price rise, and accounting for the uncertainty and risk factors, a moderate probability of price increase is assigned, acknowledging a non-negligible probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a generally positive outlook for the technology sector under President-elect Trump's second term, with expectations of reduced regulations and increased investments in AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL), as a leading Big Tech company, is likely to benefit from these favorable conditions. Analysts, including Wedbush's Dan Ives, predict significant growth for tech stocks, further supporting a bullish outlook for AAPL. While there are risks associated with market volatility and geopolitical tensions, the overall sentiment and sector-specific benefits outweigh these concerns. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the tech sector under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, driven by expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI. Analysts and CEOs are optimistic about the sector's growth, with Wedbush's Dan Ives predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, including a 25% rise in tech stocks in 2025. However, potential market volatility and trade war risks could impact Apple's stock price. Overall, the sentiment appears to favor a rise in AAPL stock due to expected favorable policies for tech companies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article suggests a positive outlook for the technology sector under the incoming Trump administration, with expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned alongside other Big Tech companies that are anticipated to benefit from these policy shifts. Analysts and CEOs express positive sentiment, with predictions of a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech and a potential 25% rise in tech stocks in 2025. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.8 for the stock price rising. However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties associated with Trump's administration and the overall market volatility. Based on the overall analysis, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be around 0.72, considering the favorable conditions for the tech sector and the positive sentiment from analysts and CEOs.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on various sectors including tech due to lighter regulations and tax cuts expected under Trump's second term. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major player in the tech sector, is likely to benefit from a less regulatory and more optimistic environment. This aligns with the predicted positive momentum for Big Tech stocks mentioned by Wedbush's Dan Ives, expecting tech stocks to rise. However, there are risks associated with geopolitical factors and market volatility, so the assessment needs to consider both positive outlooks for tech and broader geopolitical tensions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally positive outlook for the technology sector, particularly for companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to expected lighter regulations and increased investment in AI as a result of President-elect Trump's second term. The predominant sentiment among analysts suggests that Big Tech, which includes Apple, is positioned to benefit from these potential policy shifts. Despite the presence of risks such as market volatility and geopolitical tensions, the overall analysis leans towards a bullish sentiment for AAPL, supported by predictions of significant growth in the tech sector in the coming years. This leads to higher probabilities for the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The overall sentiment points towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) due to expectations of lighter regulation and increased AI investments under a Trump administration. Key figures in the tech industry, including Apple's CEO, are actively engaging with the new administration. While analysts predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario and a potential surge in tech stocks, there's acknowledgment of inherent risks such as market volatility and potential trade tensions affecting Apple's global operations. Considering the prevalent positive forecasts and previous predictions trending upwards, a higher probability is assigned to a stock price increase, although the potential uncertainties prevent an overly optimistic projection.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the anticipated reduction in regulations and increased AI investment under a second Trump term are generally positive for the tech sector, several factors temper this optimism. Trump's unpredictable nature and potential for tariffs pose significant risks.  The potential for trade disputes, particularly impacting sectors like auto manufacturing, which could negatively influence broader economic conditions, introduce further uncertainty. Apple's large global supply chain makes it vulnerable to international trade disputes. While the overall sentiment towards the tech sector is leanig positive, the specific impact on Apple isn't definitively clear.  The bullish analyst predictions are offset by the inherent uncertainties associated with a Trump presidency and potential negative macroeconomic effects. The consensus from previous prediction rounds show a range from 0.55 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, reflecting the conflicting signals. Considering the overall uncertainty and risk factors, I'm assigning a moderate probability of a price increase, acknowledging the risk of a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news presents a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector, particularly for Big Tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), under President-elect Trump's second term. Key positive factors include expectations of lighter regulation, increased investment in AI, and a reduction in antitrust scrutiny, which collectively create a favorable environment for tech stocks. Analysts, such as Wedbush's Dan Ives, predict significant growth for the sector, with a 'Goldilocks' scenario and a potential 25% rise in tech stocks in 2025. Apple, being a leader in this sector, is likely to benefit from these tailwinds. While there are risks associated with market volatility and potential trade-related uncertainties (e.g., tariffs), the overall sentiment and expert forecasts lean heavily towards a positive impact on AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions from various models also reflect this optimism, with probabilities of a stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.8. Considering the strong positive indicators and the consensus among analysts, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major player in the tech sector, is likely to benefit from a less regulatory and more optimistic environment. This aligns with the predicted positive momentum for Big Tech stocks mentioned by Wedbush's Dan Ives, expecting tech stocks to rise. However, there are risks associated with geopolitical factors and market volatility, so the assessment needs to consider both positive outlooks for tech and broader geopolitical tensions.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.74, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.26, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a generally positive outlook for the technology sector, especially for Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to anticipated policies from President-elect Trump that favor reduced regulation and increased investment in AI. This sentiment is echoed by analysts who predict significant growth for Big Tech companies, leading to an optimistic forecast for AAPL's stock. Despite concerns about market volatility and potential trade tensions that could impact Apple's global supply chain, the overall trend is toward a rise in stock prices. The previous predictions show a consistent upward trend with probabilities above 0.7 for stock price increases, reinforcing a bullish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The general sentiment across all rounds of prediction is that Apple will likely benefit from a Trump administration due to reduced regulation, increased AI investment, and general pro-business policies. There is also a consensus that external factors such as market volatility and trade tensions pose potential risks. My prediction will slightly adjust from the previous rounds and factor in the potential uncertainties associated with Trump policies, especially regarding potential trade wars/tariffs that will have negative effects on Apple's supply chains and global sales. I'll also factor in positive engagement that Big Tech leaders have had with the new administration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a Trump administration is expected to reduce regulations and increase investment in AI, generally positive for the tech sector, there are significant countervailing risks. Trump's unpredictable nature and potential for tariffs pose substantial threats.  The potential for trade disputes, especially impacting sectors like auto manufacturing, could have knock-on negative effects on the broader economy and indirectly impact Apple. Apple's substantial global supply chain makes it vulnerable to international trade disputes. While the overall sentiment towards the technology sector is leaning positive, the specific impact on Apple isn't clearly defined in the news. The bullish analyst predictions are tempered by the inherent uncertainties of a Trump presidency and the potential for negative macroeconomic consequences.  The previous predictions from various models range from 0.55 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, reflecting these conflicting signals. Considering the overall uncertainty, inherent risk, and the previous predictive models, I'm assigning a probability that leans slightly towards a price increase, but acknowledges the risk of a price decrease.  The increasing probabilities in subsequent prediction rounds suggest a gradually strengthening positive sentiment considering the overall context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The financial news presents a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector under President-elect Trump's second term, with expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI.

Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.8 for the stock price rising. Based on the overall analysis, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be around 0.72, considering the favorable conditions for the tech sector and the positive sentiment from analysts and CEOs.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on various sectors including tech due to lighter regulations and tax cuts expected under Trump's second term. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major player in the tech sector, is likely to benefit from a less regulatory and more optimistic environment. This aligns with the predicted positive momentum for Big Tech stocks mentioned by Wedbush's Dan Ives, expecting tech stocks to rise. However, there are risks associated with geopolitical factors and market volatility, so the assessment needs to consider both positive outlooks for tech and broader geopolitical tensions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling. Format your response in JSON format and include the following information as follows: \n{ \n\"reasoning\": \"[Summarize your analysis and reasoning process here]\", \n\"company_name\": \"[Company Name indicating the name of the company]\", \n\"company_symbol\": \"[Company Symbol indicating the stock symbol of the company]\", \n\"news_headline\": \"[News Headline indicating the provided financial news headline]\", \n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will rise due to this news], \n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will fall due to this news], \n} \nDo not generate output that isn't in properly formatted JSON."
