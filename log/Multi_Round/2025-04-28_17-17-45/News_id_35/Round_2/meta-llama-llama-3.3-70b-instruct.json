(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\nNews Content: Apple beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter while matching views on sales. Apple stock rose in extended trading.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's earnings beat expectations, which is generally viewed positively by investors. However, the decline in iPhone sales may raise concerns about future revenue growth, which could dampen enthusiasm. The increase in stock price in after-hours trading suggests that the immediate reaction is favorable. Overall, the positive earnings result balances some of the negativity from declining iPhone sales, leading to a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While they beat earnings targets, a key concern is the decline in iPhone sales, which traditionally drives a large portion of their revenue. However, the growth in services is a positive sign, indicating diversification. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering these and more weight put on the stock price rising in extended trading, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment, iPhone sales declined. This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests that the positive earnings beat outweighed the negative iPhone sales news, at least initially. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain, as it could indicate weakening consumer demand or increased competition. Therefore, while the initial reaction is positive, there's a considerable risk of the stock price correcting if investors become more concerned about the iPhone sales trend.  The probability of a rise is higher due to the immediate positive market response, but the uncertainty introduced by the iPhone sales decline necessitates a significant probability of a fall as well.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple beat earnings expectations, which is generally a positive signal for investors. The rise in stock price during extended trading suggests initial market optimism. However, the decline in iPhone sales could be a concern, as it is a major revenue driver for Apple. The positive impact of beating earnings targets likely outweighs the negative impact of declining iPhone sales in the short term, but the mixed results introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported beating earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter, primarily due to a lift in Services, but experienced a decline in iPhone sales. Despite the decline in iPhone sales, the company's ability to beat earnings targets suggests a positive outlook. The stock rose in extended trading, indicating an immediate positive reaction to the earnings report. However, the mixed results (beating earnings but missing on iPhone sales) might lead to varied investor reactions, including concerns about the sustainability of growth without strong iPhone sales. The overall reaction seems to lean towards the positive, given the after-hours stock price increase.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter, primarily due to a lift in its services sector, although iPhone sales declined. The fact that the company beat earnings targets and the stock rose in extended trading suggests a positive market reaction to the news. However, the decline in iPhone sales could introduce some uncertainty. Given that the positive aspect (beating earnings target) seems to have a more immediate impact on investor sentiment than the negative (decline in iPhone sales), it's reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better than expected earnings but faced a decline in iPhone sales. The fact that they managed to beat the earnings target, especially with an emphasis on their services segment, shows strength in other parts of their business model. Despite iPhone sales declining, the overall picture is one where the company performed well by market expectations, leading to an initial positive reaction in stock performance after hours.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report showed a beat against Wall Street expectations, driven mainly by growth in its Services segment, which is a positive indicator for the company's diversification strategy. However, the decline in iPhone sales, a significant revenue driver, raises concerns about future growth and consumer demand. The immediate after-hours rise in stock price suggests that investors currently favor the earnings beat over the iPhone sales decline. While there is uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of growth without strong iPhone sales, the prevailing sentiment appears to be positive in the short term, leading to a higher probability of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, primarily due to Apple beating earnings targets. The rise in stock price during extended trading further supports this view. However, the decline in iPhone sales remains a concern, acting as a counterweight. Considering the consistent, albeit varying, positive outlook from previous models, along with the immediate positive market reaction, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock rising compared to previous rounds, but also acknowledge the iPhone sales decline. Taking into consideration that multiple rounds of precitions have been done, which may reflect gradual shifts in the sentiment, it's essential to see how the prediction changes round by round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news is mixed, presenting both positive and negative aspects for Apple. The positive is that Apple beat earnings expectations, primarily driven by its Services segment. This demonstrates resilience and diversification beyond hardware reliance.  The negative is the decline in iPhone sales, a traditionally major revenue driver. This raises concerns about future growth and potential weakening consumer demand. However, the immediate market reaction (stock price increase in after-hours trading) suggests that the positive impact of exceeding earnings expectations currently outweighs the negative impact of declining iPhone sales.  Several previous models also show a similar trend, with probabilities favouring a price increase, although the degree of confidence varies.  Considering the short-term market response and the strength of the services segment, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price increase, but acknowledge the risk presented by the iPhone sales decline. The probabilities are adjusted slightly downwards from the average of previous predictions, accounting for potential unforeseen market factors, and reflecting a degree of caution considering the long-term uncertainty regarding iPhone sales.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the company beating earnings expectations due to strong performance in its services segment, but also reporting a decline in iPhone sales, which is a significant revenue driver. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in stock price during extended trading, suggests that investors are initially focusing more on the positive earnings beat. However, the decline in iPhone sales could introduce concerns about future growth, especially if the trend persists. Analyzing previous predictions, most models leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price rising (around 0.6-0.7) due to the earnings beat outweighing the iPhone sales decline in the short term, though some uncertainty remains. Given the immediate positive reaction and the consensus among previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company beat earnings targets, which is a positive signal, primarily due to a lift in its services sector. However, iPhone sales declined, which could raise concerns about future revenue growth. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests that the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering the positive earnings result and the immediate market reaction, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. However, the decline in iPhone sales introduces some uncertainty, preventing a more extreme positive prediction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple, with the company beating earnings targets due to a lift in services, but experiencing a decline in iPhone sales. The immediate market reaction, as evidenced by the rise in Apple stock in extended trading, suggests that the market is focusing more on the earnings beat and service growth than the iPhone sales decline. Considering the positive earnings result and the growth in services, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. The decline in iPhone sales introduces some uncertainty, but the overall reaction seems to lean towards the positive, given the after-hours stock price increase. The predictions from other models also indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising, with a range of 0.6 to 0.7, which supports this estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has beaten earnings expectations largely due to a rise in services revenues, though there was a decline in iPhone sales. Most prior predictions show a higher probability of the stock price rising, attributed mainly to the beating of earnings targets and the stock's initial positive market reaction. However, the decline in iPhone sales adds a degree of uncertainty, potentially impacting long-term investor confidence. Given the current trends and historical precedence of strong market reactions to earnings beats, the probability of the stock price rising is somewhat higher but balanced against potential concerns over iPhone sales.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
