This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests that the positive earnings beat outweighed the negative iPhone sales news, at least initially. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain, as it could indicate weakening consumer demand or increased competition. Therefore, while the initial reaction is positive, there's a considerable risk of the stock price correcting if investors become more concerned about the iPhone sales trend.  The probability of a rise is higher due to the immediate positive market response, but the uncertainty introduced by the iPhone sales decline necessitates a significant probability of a fall as well.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
