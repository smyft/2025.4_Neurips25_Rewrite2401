The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the past three months.\n\nTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Microsoft\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 4.91%, on average, in the last four quarters. The company is expected to post substantial earnings growth of 6.5% and revenue growth of 10.8% in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft has gained about 3.5% over the past three months.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, courtesy of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its investments in data centers and Copilot AI applications. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nIn the latest development, Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on constructing data centers designed for artificial intelligence workloads. Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 14% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from $680 to $700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to $710 from $660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has gained about 4% over the past three months.\n\nApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has gained 12% in the last three months.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

Quote\n\nAmazon recently soared to new all-time highs, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is situated in a context where the 'Magnificent 7' companies are under scrutiny. Despite a historical track record of positive earnings surprises, Apple's current metrics reveal a slight deterioration with a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and a sell rating (Zacks Rank #4). The projected earnings growth of 8.3% is modest compared to peers, which could limit upside potential. Furthermore, the weak sales guidance provided by Apple and downgrades from analysts could put downward pressure on the stock ahead of the earnings release. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple.  While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture. Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), suggesting a higher probability of missing earnings expectations.  Further, the article highlights concerns regarding the limited impact of its new AI applications and weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. While Apple has historically shown strong earnings surprises, these negative indicators outweigh the general positivity surrounding the tech sector. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed to be higher than a rise, although not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's overall strong brand and market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, with Apple (AAPL) scheduled to report on Jan. 30. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating weaker earnings potential. The company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days, and its AI features have not significantly boosted iPhone sales. Additionally, Apple provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' growth. These factors suggest potential downside risk. However, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises (average of 5.05% in the last four quarters), which could mitigate some negative sentiment. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings report is scheduled for January 30. The news mentions that Apple's Earnings ESP is -1.51% and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a potential negative outlook. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Based on these factors, it seems that the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. The article highlights the expected earnings growth and revenue increases for each company, as well as their investments in AI and other areas. Based on the information provided, I analyzed the earnings ESP, Zacks Rank, and recent stock performance for each company to estimate the probability of their stock prices rising or falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies' earnings projections and current market performance. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a negative outlook. While Apple has seen a modest positive price change over the past three months, the guidance from its earnings call suggests weak sales expectations, and it lacks positive revisions or a strong analyst recommendation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights that the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, are under scrutiny as they approach earnings reports. Despite a strong historical track record of positive earnings surprises, Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate weaker earnings expectations. Additionally, the weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and limited impact of new AI applications create a bearish sentiment surrounding Apple. The overall positive outlook for the sector is overshadowed by Apple's specific challenges, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Analyzing the news and previous predictions, the sentiment leans towards a potential fall in Apple's stock price. The consistent negative Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) across multiple rounds signal concern. The weak sales guidance and limited impact of AI features add to the bearish outlook. While a positive surprise is always possible, the prevailing indicators and expert analysis suggest downward pressure. The consistency of negative projections from other models also reinforces this sentiment. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, with Apple's report scheduled for January 30th. While the overall outlook for the group is positive, Apple's situation is more ambiguous.  Key factors influencing my prediction include Apple's negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and weak sales guidance for the first fiscal quarter ('low to mid-single digit' growth).  The lack of significant sales boosts from its new AI applications further adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple historically delivers positive earnings surprises, the current indicators suggest a higher likelihood of a negative reaction to the upcoming earnings announcement. The previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of a price decrease, although there is a range of opinions. Considering all these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing several challenges ahead of its earnings report. The company has a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which suggest a higher likelihood of missing earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple's recent AI features have not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' growth. While Apple has a historical track record of positive earnings surprises, the current negative indicators outweigh this factor. Furthermore, the lack of positive earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days adds to the downward pressure. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed to be higher than that of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc.

Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Based on these factors, it seems that the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. The modest earnings growth projection of 8.3% and a negative Earnings ESP suggest that the stock price may not experience significant upward movement. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple. Apple's earnings report is scheduled for January 30. The news mentions that Apple's Earnings ESP is -1.51% and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a potential negative outlook. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Based on these factors, it seems that the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the overall positive outlook for the tech sector and Apple's strong brand, the probability of a stock price fall is not overwhelming. The predictions from other models also suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Therefore, I estimate the probability of a stock price rise to be around 0.4, and the probability of a stock price fall to be around 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential negative outlooks. Recent AI applications have not significantly boosted iPhone sales. Additionally, weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and lack of recent earnings estimate revisions support a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's historical positive earnings surprises and brand strength offer some mitigation. The majority of previous model predictions indicate a higher probability of stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is facing a challenging outlook ahead of its upcoming earnings report, with a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). Despite historically strong earnings surprises, the absence of recent positive earnings estimate revisions, combined with weak sales guidance projecting only low to mid-single digit growth, indicates potential negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Furthermore, the limited impact of new AI applications on iPhone sales contributes to the bearish outlook. Given these indicators and the trends observed in previous predictions, it is reasonable to assess a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Analyzing the news and previous predictions, the sentiment remains consistently bearish towards Apple (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report on January 30. The key factors contributing to this outlook include the negative Earnings ESP of -1.51%, a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, and the underwhelming impact of recent AI applications on iPhone sales. While Apple has historically delivered positive earnings surprises, these current negative indicators appear to outweigh this factor. The consistent price fall projections from previous models suggest downward pressure. Therefore, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the overall tech sector, particularly the 'Magnificent 7,' shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific circumstances are less optimistic.  Key negative indicators include a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and the limited impact of its new AI features on iPhone sales. These factors strongly suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. However, Apple's historical record of positive earnings surprises (5.05% average) and its robust brand recognition offer some counterbalance to the negative sentiment. Considering the weight of the negative factors and the consistent bearish predictions from previous models, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise, although not absolute.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news reveals several negative indicators. Apple has a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which typically suggest a higher likelihood of missing earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company has provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' growth. While Apple has a historical track record of positive earnings surprises, the current negative indicators and lack of positive earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days outweigh this factor. The majority of previous model predictions also indicate a higher probability of a stock price fall.

The weak sales guidance and the limited impact of AI features added to the iPhone sales do not contribute positively. While the company has a history of positive earnings surprises, current indicators suggest a higher likelihood of negative market reaction.
