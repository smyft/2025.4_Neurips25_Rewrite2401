Here's what the CEOs of Apple, Meta and Microsoft are saying\nNews Content: The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a new competitor in the AI space, DeepSeek, which could affect the dynamics of AI cost and competition among large tech companies, including Apple. However, Tim Cook's comments suggest a neutral to positive outlook on innovations driving efficiency, which mitigates immediate concern for Apple's business strategy and stock performance. Despite facing challenges in China with revenue down, the lack of direct adverse mention of Apple's engagement with AI relative to DeepSeek implies a more stable effect on its stock. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated higher than that of a fall, but cautiously due to external pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of Apple's AI investments. Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the potential benefits of improved efficiency. However, Apple's existing challenges in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, add a layer of complexity. Overall, the news isn't strongly positive or negative for Apple's stock. While DeepSeek could pressure Apple to innovate more efficiently, the company is already facing headwinds in a crucial market. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a small stock price decrease due to the combination of AI competition and pre-existing issues in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on DeepSeek's impact on Big Tech, with Apple CEO Tim Cook offering a generally positive outlook on innovation driving efficiency.  While Cook acknowledges the positive aspect of DeepSeek's advancements, the news also highlights Apple's significant year-over-year revenue decline of 11% in China. This negative performance in a key market is a more significant factor than the relatively neutral stance on DeepSeek's impact on Apple's business. The overall tone regarding DeepSeek's impact on Apple is mildly positive but not overwhelmingly so.  The countervailing factor of the significant drop in Chinese revenue makes a price rise less likely than a neutral or slightly negative movement. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the impact of DeepSeek's competitive AI models on Big Tech, including Apple. While the overall sentiment from CEOs like Tim Cook is cautiously optimistic about innovation driving efficiency, Apple's specific challenges in China, including an 11% drop in revenue, could weigh on investor sentiment. The avoidance of the initial sell-off suggests some resilience, but the underlying issues in a key market like China may limit upside potential. The broader concern about AI model commoditization and cost pressures could also indirectly affect Apple's positioning in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's AI models and their potential impact on Big Tech companies' stock prices is neutral to slightly positive for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While DeepSeek's advancements in AI have raised questions about the competitiveness of Big Tech companies, Apple's CEO Tim Cook expressed optimism about innovation driving efficiency being a good thing. The company's stock price may not be directly significantly affected in the short term as it didn't experience the same level of sell-off as other tech giants. However, the overall impact of AI advancements on the tech industry and Apple's strategic positioning will be crucial in determining its stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed competitive AI models at a lower cost than Big Tech companies. The CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have taken an optimistic tone regarding DeepSeek's models, citing the potential for innovation and efficiency gains. However, the article also mentions that Apple's revenue in China was down 11% year over year, which could be a negative factor. Overall, the news suggests that the Big Tech companies are open to embracing and learning from DeepSeek's innovations, which could lead to increased efficiency and competitiveness in the industry. Given the positive tone from the CEOs and the potential for long-term benefits, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on global tech stocks. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, acknowledges the positive aspects of such innovations but mentions challenges in China. However, the news does not specifically highlight any direct negative impacts on Apple. Thus, the overall sentiment regarding Apple seems neutral with minimal immediate impact expected.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
