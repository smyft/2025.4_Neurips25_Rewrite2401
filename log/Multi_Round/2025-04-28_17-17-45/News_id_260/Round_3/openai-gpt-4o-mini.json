(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok and its potential ban on the app store has significant implications for Apple, given that the company operates the App Store where TikTok is currently available. If the ban goes into effect and TikTok is unable to operate in the US, it could reduce app downloads and in-app purchases associated with TikTok, potentially affecting Apple's revenue from the app ecosystem. However, the uncertainty surrounding potential actions by President-elect Trump to delay the enforcement of this law adds unpredictability. If TikTok remains accessible, it may not drastically impact Apple's stock, but a definitive shutdown could lead to negative sentiment around Apple due to perceived regulatory risks. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline due to the immediate negative implications of the TikTok ban threat over the uncertain potential positive outcomes from delayed enforcement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. While Apple is mentioned as one of the companies affected by the potential ban (as it will be required to remove TikTok from its app store), the news ultimately impacts ByteDance and TikTok much more directly. The impact on Apple is indirect; the potential removal of one app, albeit popular, is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall financials, considering their diverse product and service offerings. The news paints a picture of uncertainty, with multiple possible scenarios including Trump potentially delaying or overturning the ban, or a divestiture to a US company taking place. While a ban could potentially slightly decrease traffic to the app store, there is no immediate downside risk, and the effect on Apple's finances would be negligible. Therefore the news is essentially a non-event for Apple stock in the short term. There is a very slight bias to the downside because app store revenue can be slightly impacted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok from US app stores on January 19th.  This directly impacts Apple, as the law requires Apple to remove TikTok from its app store if a divestment doesn't occur. While the article highlights potential delays or resolutions, the immediate impact could be negative for Apple.  The potential for legal challenges, uncertainty surrounding President Trump's actions, and the possibility of TikTok choosing to voluntarily shut down are all factors to consider.  While a ban could remove a significant download source for TikTok, the article notes that the app would not immediately disappear from existing user's phones. The long-term impact on Apple's stock is therefore less certain, thus leading to a relatively neutral probability for both price increases and decreases.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple. Apple (AAPL) could face short-term challenges if TikTok is removed from its App Store, as it may lose revenue from app downloads and in-app purchases. However, the impact is likely limited given Apple's diversified revenue streams and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its overall App Store revenue. Additionally, the uncertainty around enforcement and potential political interventions (e.g., Trump's possible actions to delay or overturn the ban) adds complexity. Overall, the news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price, but there is some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. The law requires Apple to remove TikTok from its app store if TikTok is not divested, which could have a minor impact on Apple's revenue. However, the overall effect on Apple's business is expected to be minimal as TikTok is just one of many apps offered through the App Store. The uncertainty around the ban's enforcement and potential interventions by President-elect Trump add complexity but do not significantly alter Apple's long-term outlook. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to short-term market reaction and uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on Apple, as the company would be required to remove the app from its app store. However, the ban's enforcement is uncertain, and President-elect Trump may take actions to delay or reverse it. The article also mentions that the ban would not immediately affect existing users, but rather prevent new downloads. Considering the potential uncertainty and the limited direct impact on Apple's overall business, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, as investors may be cautiously watching the developments but are unlikely to significantly alter their investment decisions based on this news alone.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app in the US due to regulatory and legal challenges. While Apple itself is not directly involved in these events, negative impacts on TikTok could affect its services and potentially spillover effects on Apple's stock, though these effects may be minimal. Apple's stock might experience some volatility depending on broader market reactions and investor sentiment. However, Apple's core business remains robust, and the company is not directly impacted by the TikTok situation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news surrounding the potential ban of TikTok in the US has implications for Apple, as the company will be required to remove TikTok from its App Store if a divestment does not occur. While there is uncertainty regarding enforcement and potential political interventions that could mitigate the ban, the immediate sentiment appears to be negatively skewed towards Apple since it will lose a popular app from its offerings. Given the mixed responses from other analyses, a slight leaning towards stock price decline is warranted, reflecting the immediate concerns raised by the news despite Apple's overall strong business performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and Apple's role in removing it from the App Store. This creates uncertainty but doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's business. Other models' predictions are mixed, but generally leaning towards slightly negative or neutral. The earlier rounds demonstrate some sentiment towards negative impact, but not strongly so. Trump's potential interventions add further uncertainty. Given the lack of a clear consensus and Apple's diversified business, I'll adjust my prediction to reflect slightly more certainty on neutral response.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario with multiple potential outcomes, making it difficult to definitively predict Apple's stock price movement.  While Apple is directly impacted by having to remove TikTok from its App Store if the ban is enforced, the effect on Apple's overall revenue and profits is likely to be minimal given the size and diversity of Apple's business.  The uncertainty surrounding President-elect Trump's actions and the possibility of a last-minute resolution or delay significantly reduces the likelihood of a substantial stock price movement in either direction.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities leaning slightly towards a price fall, primarily due to the uncertainty and potential short-term market reaction.  However, the lack of a significant direct negative impact suggests that any price movement would likely be small and temporary.  Considering the uncertainty and the diverse opinions of other models, a neutral probability distribution is the most appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple Inc., as the company would be required to remove the app from its App Store. While this could have a minor impact on Apple's revenue from app downloads and in-app purchases, the effect is likely limited given Apple's diversified revenue streams and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its overall App Store revenue. The uncertainty around enforcement, potential political interventions (e.g., Trump's possible actions to delay or overturn the ban), and the fact that existing users would not be immediately affected add complexity. Previous predictions from other models suggest a slight bias towards a stock price decline due to short-term market reaction and uncertainty, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, but the difference is not significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. The law requires Apple to remove TikTok from its app store if TikTok is not divested, which could have a minor impact on Apple's revenue from app downloads and in-app purchases associated with TikTok.

However, taking into account the diversified revenue streams of Apple and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its overall App Store revenue, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and removal of TikTok from the Apple App Store, which has implications for Apple but is not a direct threat to its core business. Most of the previous predictions indicate a slight to moderate probability of the stock price falling due to uncertainties and the potential short-term market reaction. There is little direct evidence supporting a major impact on Apple's overall financial health or operations. However, considering the potential for consumer sentiment and temporary market reaction, there is a higher perceived risk of the stock price falling, albeit marginally.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The recent news regarding the potential ban of TikTok has considerable implications for Apple, as it could require the company to remove TikTok from its App Store due to new regulatory laws. Although the ban's enforcement introduces uncertainty, and potential political interventions from President-elect Trump may delay or alter the situation, the immediate sentiment towards the stock appears cautiously negative. Given the mixed predictions and the overall analysis suggesting that while the impact on Apple's financials may be limited, investors are likely to react to the uncertainty and potential loss of a popular app from the App Store. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling as the market processes these risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential TikTok ban and its impact on Apple. While Apple isn't directly targeted, the removal of TikTok from its App Store could lead to a minor reduction in revenue. The situation is complex, with the possibility of Trump intervening. Previous models showed a slight bias toward a price decrease due to uncertainty. However, considering Apple's diverse business and the lack of a major direct impact, the negative impact on the stock is likely to be limited. Therefore, I am predicting a slight decrease in terms of probability because of the potential reduction in App Store revenue which leads to investor concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding a potential TikTok ban in the US presents a complex scenario for Apple. While Apple would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be minimal given its diversified revenue streams and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its overall App Store revenue.

However, the lack of a significant direct negative impact suggests that any price movement would likely be small and temporary.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the relatively minor impact on Apple's business, a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall is warranted, reflecting the potential for short-term negative market sentiment.  The probability is kept close to 0.5, emphasizing the significant uncertainty in the situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple Inc.
