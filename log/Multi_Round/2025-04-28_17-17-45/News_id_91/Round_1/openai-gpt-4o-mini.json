(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\nNews Content: Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is in a strong position to benefit from advancements in AI without the significant financial risk associated with investments by its competitors. Analysts indicate that DeepSeek's emergence poses limited competitive threat to Apple, providing a positive outlook for the company's performance in AI. Furthermore, the anticipation of Apple's upcoming quarterly results adds another factor that could positively influence stock performance. Therefore, the likelihood of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests a modestly positive outlook for Apple. Baird's analysis indicates that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI trends without needing to make massive capital expenditures like its competitors. This is seen as a positive, suggesting potential cost savings and efficient innovation. The rise of DeepSeek is presented as less of a threat to Apple than to other Big Tech firms, and that Apple's strategic focus on consumer-facing AI experiences could drive future product upgrade cycles. Apple's relatively lower capital expenditure in AI compared to peers like Microsoft and Meta, especially regarding AI, supports this viewpoint. However, the news also mentions concerns about the spending on AI being unwarranted, which could create some doubt about the value Apple will get from AI development. Additionally, the competition of DeepSeek model is also a concern for companies focusing on AI. Considering these factors, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a price fall, but the impact will likely be muted. Apple also has earnings coming out today, which are more likely to significantly affect the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Baird's analysis suggests Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI advancements without massive capital expenditures, unlike its competitors.  This positions Apple favorably in the context of DeepSeek's emergence, which has raised concerns about the excessive AI spending by other tech giants.  The fact that DeepSeek's app became a top download on Apple's App Store could even be seen as indirectly beneficial. While DeepSeek's impact remains uncertain, the news generally paints a positive picture for Apple's AI strategy. The upcoming earnings report is a significant factor, with positive results potentially amplifying the positive sentiment from this news. However, overall market conditions and reactions to the earnings report itself could still impact the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is seen as 'well-positioned' to benefit from AI without the massive spending seen in other Big Tech companies, which could be viewed positively by investors. The emergence of DeepSeek is considered to have a 'limited' competitive impact on Apple, and the company's focus on integrating AI into consumer products could drive future upgrades. Additionally, Apple's capital expenditures are more modest compared to peers, suggesting efficient use of resources. Given these factors, the news is likely to be perceived as favorable for Apple's stock. However, the broader market reaction to AI-related news and upcoming earnings could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's stock is 'well-positioned' to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model. The analysts at Baird argue that Apple can leverage generative AI without massive expenditures, unlike its competitors. This positive outlook, combined with the fact that Apple's capital expenditures on AI are relatively modest compared to peers, is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The upcoming release of Apple's December quarter results may also positively impact the stock if the company meets or exceeds expectations. Overall, the news appears to be positive for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from AI despite the emergence of DeepSeek, a company that has introduced a low-cost AI model. Analysts at Baird believe that Apple's exposure to the competitive impact of DeepSeek's AI model is limited, and that the company can benefit from generative AI without spending heavily on large language models or infrastructure. This positive assessment, combined with the fact that Apple is due to report its December quarter results soon, may lead to a positive outlook on the company's stock. However, the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential to disrupt the AI landscape may also introduce some uncertainty and volatility into the market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
