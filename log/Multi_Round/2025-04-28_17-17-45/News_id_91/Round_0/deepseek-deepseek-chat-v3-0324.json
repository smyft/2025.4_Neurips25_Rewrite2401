(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\nNews Content: Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The emergence of DeepSeek is considered to have a 'limited' competitive impact on Apple, and the company's focus on integrating AI into consumer products could drive future upgrades. Additionally, Apple's capital expenditures are more modest compared to peers, suggesting efficient use of resources. Given these factors, the news is likely to be perceived as favorable for Apple's stock.
