(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon.

In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the regulatory landscape favoring Apple due to Trump's defense against EU antitrust actions. This may create a more favorable environment for Apple, reducing the pressure from fines and legal battles. Additionally, the historical context suggests a potential market relief for tech companies, which could boost Apple's stock. However, there remains inherent market risk related to the ongoing legal battles and economic factors that could influence investor sentiment. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock rising compared to falling, but caution remains due to external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On the one hand, Trump's public defense of American tech companies against EU antitrust actions is a positive signal. This could suggest a more lenient regulatory environment for Apple in the coming years, reducing potential fines and restrictions on its business practices in Europe. The news also highlights that Big Tech including Apple are seemingly cozying up to Trump which signals potential future regulatory advantages. \n\nHowever, the article also details the financial impact of past EU fines on Apple's earnings. The ongoing scrutiny from both the EU and the US (DOJ antitrust suit) creates uncertainty and potential future liabilities. \n\nThe positive sentiment from Trump\u2019s backing slightly outweighs the negative impact of ongoing antitrust battles. So the stock is likely to rise but not greatly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Trump's statement expressing support for American tech companies against EU antitrust actions could be interpreted positively by investors.  This is because it suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressure on Apple and reduced risk of future large fines. However, the news is not a guarantee of reduced regulatory scrutiny. The article highlights that the US government is also actively pursuing anti-trust investigations into Big Tech.  Therefore, while Trump's statement may offer some short-term positive sentiment, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The past impact of EU fines on Apple's earnings suggests a potential for negative sentiment, although the current news focuses on a political statement rather than new legal action. Weighing these factors, a slight increase in stock price is more likely than a significant drop, but uncertainty remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's criticism of the EU's antitrust fines on US tech giants, including Apple, and suggests a potential shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under his administration. While the fines have previously impacted Apple's earnings (e.g., the 13 billion euro fine reduced EPS in Q4), Trump's stance could reduce future regulatory risks. However, the immediate financial impact of past fines and ongoing legal battles may still weigh on investor sentiment. The market might react positively to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure but could remain cautious due to existing uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing tensions between the US and EU regarding antitrust battles against American tech giants, particularly Apple. President Trump's comments suggest a defensive stance towards US tech companies, implying a potential shift in regulatory environment that could favor them. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust suits and fines imposed on these companies, which could negatively impact their stock prices. For Apple specifically, the EU's $15 billion or $16 billion win from a court case and the $2 billion fine in March 2024 are highlighted. Despite this, Trump's comments might indicate a softer regulatory approach in the US, which could positively affect Apple's stock price. The mixed implications of this news, with both potential regulatory relief and continued scrutiny, make it challenging to predict a significant stock price movement. However, considering Trump's inclination to support US tech giants and his criticism of EU's regulatory actions, there's a slight inclination towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to potential regulatory changes favorable to US tech companies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's comments on the European Union's antitrust battles with American tech giants, including Apple. Trump's defense of these companies and his criticism of the EU's regulatory actions could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple and other tech companies. This could potentially lead to an increase in Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust battles in the US, which could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights potential regulatory threats and conflicts between the US and the EU regarding American tech giants. Specifically, Apple is facing significant antitrust battles with the European Union, leading to substantial fines. Additionally, both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust actions against major tech companies, including Apple. While President Trump's stance might suggest a more favorable regulatory environment in the future, current ongoing legal challenges pose significant risks to the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
