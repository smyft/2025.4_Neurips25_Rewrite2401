(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the regulatory landscape favoring Apple due to Trump's defense against EU antitrust actions. This may create a more favorable environment for Apple, reducing the pressure from fines and legal battles. Additionally, the historical context suggests a potential market relief for tech companies, which could boost Apple's stock. However, there remains inherent market risk related to the ongoing legal battles and economic factors that could influence investor sentiment. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock rising compared to falling, but caution remains due to external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On the one hand, Trump's public defense of American tech companies against EU antitrust actions is a positive signal. This could suggest a more lenient regulatory environment for Apple in the coming years, reducing potential fines and restrictions on its business practices in Europe. The news also highlights that Big Tech including Apple are seemingly cozying up to Trump which signals potential future regulatory advantages. \n\nHowever, the article also details the financial impact of past EU fines on Apple's earnings. The ongoing scrutiny from both the EU and the US (DOJ antitrust suit) creates uncertainty and potential future liabilities. \n\nThe positive sentiment from Trump\u2019s backing slightly outweighs the negative impact of ongoing antitrust battles. So the stock is likely to rise but not greatly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Trump's statement expressing support for American tech companies against EU antitrust actions could be interpreted positively by investors.  This is because it suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressure on Apple and reduced risk of future large fines. However, the news is not a guarantee of reduced regulatory scrutiny. The article highlights that the US government is also actively pursuing anti-trust investigations into Big Tech.  Therefore, while Trump's statement may offer some short-term positive sentiment, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The past impact of EU fines on Apple's earnings suggests a potential for negative sentiment, although the current news focuses on a political statement rather than new legal action. Weighing these factors, a slight increase in stock price is more likely than a significant drop, but uncertainty remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's criticism of the EU's antitrust fines on US tech giants, including Apple, and suggests a potential shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under his administration. While the fines have previously impacted Apple's earnings (e.g., the 13 billion euro fine reduced EPS in Q4), Trump's stance could reduce future regulatory risks. However, the immediate financial impact of past fines and ongoing legal battles may still weigh on investor sentiment. The market might react positively to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure but could remain cautious due to existing uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing tensions between the US and EU regarding antitrust battles against American tech giants, particularly Apple. President Trump's comments suggest a defensive stance towards US tech companies, implying a potential shift in regulatory environment that could favor them. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust suits and fines imposed on these companies, which could negatively impact their stock prices. For Apple specifically, the EU's $15 billion or $16 billion win from a court case and the $2 billion fine in March 2024 are highlighted. Despite this, Trump's comments might indicate a softer regulatory approach in the US, which could positively affect Apple's stock price. The mixed implications of this news, with both potential regulatory relief and continued scrutiny, make it challenging to predict a significant stock price movement. However, considering Trump's inclination to support US tech giants and his criticism of EU's regulatory actions, there's a slight inclination towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to potential regulatory changes favorable to US tech companies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's comments on the European Union's antitrust battles with American tech giants, including Apple. Trump's defense of these companies and his criticism of the EU's regulatory actions could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple and other tech companies. This could potentially lead to an increase in Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust battles in the US, which could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights potential regulatory threats and conflicts between the US and the EU regarding American tech giants. Specifically, Apple is facing significant antitrust battles with the European Union, leading to substantial fines. Additionally, both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust actions against major tech companies, including Apple. While President Trump's stance might suggest a more favorable regulatory environment in the future, current ongoing legal challenges pose significant risks to the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech companies like Apple against EU antitrust actions, suggesting a potential shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment. This could alleviate some pressures from past fines and ongoing legal challenges. While there are still significant risks from both EU and US regulatory actions, the overall tone of the statements may lend positive sentiment to the stock. However, uncertainty remains due to ongoing lawsuits and scrutiny, leading to a cautious but slightly optimistic outlook for the stock's movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight leaning towards stock price rising. This is primarily driven by the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment under a Trump administration. However, some previous models also highlighted the ongoing antitrust battles and potential future liabilities. Model qwen/qwen-turbo stands out as the only one predicting a fall in price. Given this divergence, and the inherent uncertainty of governmental influence and antitrust legal proceedings, it is highly risky to sway one way or another. I'll adjust towards the median result of other round's models.\n\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Trump's defense of US tech companies against EU antitrust actions is positive, suggesting potential regulatory relief and reduced future fines.  However, ongoing antitrust battles in both the US and EU, coupled with the significant financial impact of past EU fines, introduce substantial uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation. While Trump's statement might offer short-term market optimism, the long-term implications remain unclear given the persistent legal challenges. Considering the balanced arguments and the spread of previous predictions, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure from a potential future Trump administration.  The historical impact of EU fines and the ongoing investigations in both the US and EU, however, temper this optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, President Trump's defense of American tech giants against EU antitrust actions could signal a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially reducing future fines and legal pressures. This political backing may boost investor confidence. On the other hand, the article highlights significant past fines (e.g., \u20ac13 billion and $2 billion) that have already impacted Apple's earnings, and ongoing antitrust battles in both the EU and US introduce uncertainty. While Trump's stance might offer short-term relief, the persistent regulatory risks and financial impacts from past fines could temper market optimism. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the margin is narrow due to lingering risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's comments criticizing the European Union's antitrust fines on American tech giants, including Apple. Trump's defense of these companies suggests a potential shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple. However, ongoing antitrust battles in both the EU and the US pose risks. Considering Trump's inclination to support US tech giants and his criticism of EU's regulatory actions, there's a slightly higher inclination towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to potential regulatory changes favorable to US tech companies. But, the overall uncertainty and mixed implications of this news make a significant stock price movement uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed scenario for Apple, with President Trump's defense of US tech companies against EU antitrust actions potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the ongoing antitrust battles in both the EU and the US pose significant risks. Considering the positive sentiment from Trump's backing and the historical context of tech companies seeking to cozy up to him, there is a potential for a slightly more favorable outlook for Apple. Yet, the uncertainty and potential future liabilities from ongoing investigations and fines impose caution. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there is a trend indicating a slight inclination towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to potential regulatory changes favorable to US tech companies. Nonetheless, the probability of the stock price rising is not significantly higher than that of falling due to the complexities and uncertainties involved.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the regulatory landscape favoring American tech giants due to Trump's defense against EU antitrust actions. This could create a more favorable environment for companies like Apple, potentially reducing the pressure from fines and legal battles. However, the news also indicates ongoing antitrust battles and legal actions domestically, which could pose significant risks. The previous predictions show a generally positive sentiment due to Trump's support but caution due to ongoing litigation. My analysis considers both the short-term positive signal and long-term uncertainties, leading to a balanced view with a slight tilt towards a rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news suggests a potential shift in the regulatory landscape that may benefit Apple due to Trump's defense of American tech companies against EU antitrust actions. This could imply a reduction in regulatory pressures and fines, which might positively influence investor sentiment. However, ongoing antitrust investigations in both the EU and US still pose significant risks to Apple's stock price. Overall, while there is a more favorable outlook towards regulatory changes under Trump's administration, the uncertainty stemming from existing legal challenges tempers this optimism. After considering previous predictions and the mixed implications from current news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the chances of a fall remain notable due to existing legal contexts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Analyzing the news and previous predictions, the dominant sentiment remains that President Trump's defense of US tech companies against EU antitrust actions provides a potential boost to Apple. This could translate to regulatory relief and reduce the risk of future fines. However, ongoing antitrust battles in both the US and EU continue to create uncertainty. The previous rounds show a convergence around a slightly positive outlook, acknowledging both the potential upside from Trump's support and the downside risks from ongoing legal challenges. I'm adjusting slightly upwards, but remaining cautious given the conflicting signals. The donations by Apple's CEO and other tech leaders to Trump's inauguration could also be a factor that lead to a more favorable environment for big-tech under the Trump administration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Trump's vocal support against EU antitrust actions is a positive, suggesting potential regulatory relief and reduced future fines.  This could improve investor sentiment and lead to a stock price increase. However, significant counterpoints exist.  Apple faces ongoing antitrust suits in both the US and EU, with substantial financial penalties already incurred.  These ongoing legal battles introduce considerable uncertainty and risk, potentially outweighing any positive sentiment from Trump's comments.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight majority leaning towards a price rise, mainly due to the perceived potential shift in regulatory climate. However, the uncertainty and risk associated with the ongoing legal actions temper the enthusiasm.  Considering the mixed signals and the potential for both upward and downward pressure, I am assigning a probability closer to neutral, slightly weighted towards a rise given Trump's stated support, but recognizing the substantial risk involved.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). President Trump's defense of American tech giants against EU antitrust actions could signal a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially reducing future fines and legal pressures.

While Trump's stance might offer short-term relief, the persistent regulatory risks and financial impacts from past fines could temper market optimism. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the margin is narrow due to lingering risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust actions, suggesting a potential shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment.

While there are still significant risks from both EU and US regulatory actions, the overall tone of the statements may lend positive sentiment to the stock.

The news is optimistic towards the regulatory environment but highlights ongoing legal challenges domestically. Previous predictions suggest a mix of sentiments, with a slight lean towards a positive outlook for Apple.
