(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023.

Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon.

In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.
