      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook is a fan of DeepSeek's innovation. When an analyst asked the executive on the earnings call about what he thinks about the AI model from China, Cook replied: \u201cI think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, is supportive of innovation like DeepSeek, which suggests a positive outlook on AI-driven efficiency improvements. This could enhance investor confidence in Apple's future growth and efficiency, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, since the news is not a major announcement or a significant development, the impact might be modest, leading to a lower probability of a drastic price movement. Thus, I estimate a higher likelihood of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\" suggests a positive, albeit subtle, sentiment from Apple's CEO regarding AI innovation from DeepSeek. While not a direct endorsement or investment announcement, Cook's acknowledgement signals an openness to external AI developments, which could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple's future strategies, suggesting potential future integration or partnerships. Such positive signals typically have uptrending tendencies on stock prices, so I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a price increase than a price decrease. However, the impact is likely to be small given the statement is not a major announcement. I am also factoring in the current overall market climate, where any positive AI mention is more likely to yield an uptrend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content are very vague and provide minimal information regarding Apple's direct involvement or impact from DeepSeek. Tim Cook's comment is generic and positive towards 'innovation that drives efficiency'.  This statement doesn't offer any specific insights into Apple's business, financials, or competitive landscape. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors and not directly attributable to this news.  I'm assuming a neutral market reaction, slightly favoring a neutral to slightly positive reaction due to the generally positive sentiment expressed by Cook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO Tim Cook has a positive view of DeepSeek's innovation, which could be interpreted as a signal that Apple is open to or supportive of advancements in AI technology from China. This could be seen as a positive for Apple's innovation ecosystem and partnerships. However, the comment is relatively neutral and does not indicate any immediate business impact or financial benefit. Therefore, the market reaction is likely to be muted, with a slight positive bias given Cook's reputation for strategic partnerships and innovation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple CEO Tim Cook is positive about an AI model from China called DeepSeek, stating that innovation driving efficiency is a good thing. However, this news does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or provide any specific guidance on the company's future prospects. As a result, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. The CEO's positive comment about a third-party AI innovation does not provide any significant new information that would materially affect Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, views DeepSeek's innovation as a 'good thing', which implies a positive sentiment towards the AI model. However, the statement is quite general and does not provide any specific information about how DeepSeek's innovation will directly impact Apple's business. Given the lack of concrete details, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the positive sentiment expressed by the CEO might slightly increase investor confidence, leading to a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive stance from Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, regarding an AI model (DeepSeek) from China. While the comment itself does not appear directly tied to Apple\u2019s core business performance, it highlights a supportive attitude towards AI innovations which is generally seen favorably by the market. Such positive commentary can bolster investor confidence in the company's approach towards cutting-edge technology, potentially leading to a positive sentiment towards the stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's CEO, Tim Cook's, positive view on DeepSeek's innovation, which signals a favorable sentiment towards AI technologies. This can boost investor confidence in Apple's strategy towards leveraging AI for efficiency. However, the statement lacks specific financial implications or direct relevance to Apple's business operations, making the expected impact on stock price relatively muted. Overall, considering the past predictions from others and the tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall, reflective of cautious optimism about the potential benefits of AI innovation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment from Apple's CEO toward DeepSeek's innovation. However, it's a general statement and doesn't directly translate to specific financial impact on Apple. Considering previous predictions range from 0.52 to 0.65 for a stock rise. While the sentiment is positive, the actual impact is likely minimal, but I will weight my model towards the more neutral. Therefore, the actual impact on the stock price is unlikely to be significant alone. The model should predict slight rise of the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is rather neutral. Tim Cook's statement is generic and positive towards innovation, but lacks specifics regarding any direct impact on Apple's business or financials.  Previous predictions range from 0.52 to 0.65 for a price rise, reflecting the ambiguity of the news.  The consensus leans slightly positive but acknowledges the limited impact of this particular statement.  Considering the overall market sentiment and the slight positive bias in the previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise.  However, this is a minor news item and likely won't significantly affect the stock price, which will primarily be influenced by other factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has a positive view of DeepSeek's AI innovation, describing it as a 'good thing'.

However, the statement is quite general and does not provide specific details about any direct impact on Apple's business or financials. Given the lack of concrete information, the market reaction is likely to be muted. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this sentiment, with most estimating a slight positive bias but acknowledging the limited impact of the news. Considering the overall neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the consensus from previous predictions, I estimate a modest probability of a stock price rise and a slightly lower probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has expressed a positive view of DeepSeek's innovation, stating it is a 'good thing'.

Nevertheless, the positive sentiment expressed by the CEO might slightly increase investor confidence, leading to a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also suggest a slightly higher probability of a price increase, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.57, and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.43.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive stance from Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, regarding an AI model (DeepSeek) from China.
