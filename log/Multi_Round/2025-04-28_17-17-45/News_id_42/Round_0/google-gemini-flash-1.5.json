Tim Cook's comment is generic and positive towards 'innovation that drives efficiency'.  This statement doesn't offer any specific insights into Apple's business, financials, or competitive landscape. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors and not directly attributable to this news.  I'm assuming a neutral market reaction, slightly favoring a neutral to slightly positive reaction due to the generally positive sentiment expressed by Cook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
