While not a direct endorsement or investment announcement, Cook's acknowledgement signals an openness to external AI developments, which could be interpreted as a positive signal for Apple's future strategies, suggesting potential future integration or partnerships. Such positive signals typically have uptrending tendencies on stock prices, so I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a price increase than a price decrease. However, the impact is likely to be small given the statement is not a major announcement. I am also factoring in the current overall market climate, where any positive AI mention is more likely to yield an uptrend.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
