However, this news does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or provide any specific guidance on the company's future prospects. As a result, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. The CEO's positive comment about a third-party AI innovation does not provide any significant new information that would materially affect Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's Tim Cook Says DeepSeek Is a \u2018Good Thing\u2019\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```\n\nIn this analysis, I estimate that there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising (52%) than falling (48%), as the news does not contain any negative sentiment and the CEO's positive comment about innovation could be seen as a mildly positive factor. However, the impact is likely to be limited, and the probabilities reflect a relatively neutral assessment."
