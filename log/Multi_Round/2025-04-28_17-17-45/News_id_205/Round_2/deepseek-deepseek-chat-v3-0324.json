(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Top-Stock Crown as Analysts Downgrade on iPhone Risk\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nShares fell 3.2% on Tuesday, closing at its lowest since November amid a rocky start to the year. The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in the critical China market, suggest a weakened outlook for Apple. The stock has already experienced a significant decline, reflecting investor concerns. With a consensus rating dropping and fewer analysts recommending a buy, the sentiment appears bearish. Given that a large part of Apple's revenue comes from iPhones and the dismal sales data, there is a higher probability of stock price decline in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Several analysts have downgraded the stock due to concerns about weakening iPhone sales, especially in China. The failure of AI to act as a catalyst for upgrades is also a concern. The stock has already experienced a significant drop this month, closing at its lowest level since November. The consensus rating is also declining and buy ratings are significantly lower than other megacap tech stocks. Morgan Stanley replacing Apple with Seagate as their top pick in IT hardware adds to the negative sentiment. Apple reporting earnings next week could amplify the negative trend if the company fails to allay analyst concerns. While surprises are always possible, the downward pressure is considerable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple's stock price has experienced a significant drop following analyst downgrades citing concerns about weakening iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The news highlights worse-than-expected sales figures and suggests that the anticipated boost from AI integration is not yet materializing.  The consensus rating has dropped to its lowest point since May, reflecting a growing pessimism amongst analysts. While 60% of analysts still recommend buying, this is lower than other megacap tech stocks, and the two downgrades to 'hold' and 'underperform' signal a shift in sentiment. The upcoming earnings report next week is a key catalyst; if it confirms the weakness in iPhone sales, further downward pressure on the stock is likely.  Conversely, if the report surprises positively and shows resilience in other segments, the stock could recover some of its losses, potentially mitigating the negative impact of the current news.  Given the current negative sentiment and the relatively low probability of a significant positive surprise, the probability of a price fall is assessed as higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of expected growth from AI features. Two analyst downgrades (to 'hold' and 'underperform'), weak sales data (-18.2% in China, -5% globally), and skepticism about near-term AI-driven upgrades suggest negative sentiment. The stock has already declined significantly (-3.2% on Tuesday, -11% in January, -14% from December peak), and with lowered guidance expectations for the March quarter, further downside risk is likely. While Apple retains some bullish analyst coverage (63% buy ratings), the downgrades and weak fundamentals tilt probabilities toward further declines in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by analysts due to concerns over soft iPhone sales and the failure of artificial intelligence to act as a growth catalyst. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies, along with a 3.2% drop in the stock price on Tuesday, suggest a negative short-term outlook. Additionally, the stock has dropped 11% in January and 14% from its December peak, and more than $110 billion was erased from its market capitalization. These factors contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top-stock crown due to concerns over soft iPhone sales, which has led to analyst downgrades. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies, as well as previous downgrades from MoffettNathanson, suggest a bearish outlook for the company's stock. Additionally, the news mentions that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter and global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year, which further supports the bearish sentiment. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of the stock price falling is high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrades from analysts due to concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly in critical markets like China, have significantly impacted investor sentiment towards Apple. The stock is already experiencing downward pressure, having dropped significantly in January and now facing projected disappointing earnings guidance. With the consensus rating among analysts dropping and only 8.5% of the analysts now holding bearish views, the overall sentiment remains predominantly negative. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the current bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple is decidedly negative. Analyst downgrades stemming from weak iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, dominate the news. The failure of AI to spur a super cycle further dampens expectations. The stock's recent performance \u2013 closing at its lowest since November, an 11% drop in January, and a loss of its top stock crown to Nvidia \u2013 underscores the pessimism. While a slight potential for an earnings surprise exists, the consensus points towards a continuation of the downward trend, influencing my adjusted estimations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The overwhelming consensus among previous models and the provided news points towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.  Analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales (particularly in the crucial Chinese market), and the failure of AI to boost sales are significant negative factors. The already substantial stock price decline, coupled with the expectation of disappointing March quarter guidance, reinforces this negative outlook. While a positive surprise during the earnings report next week is possible, the current bearish sentiment and the weight of negative indicators make a price rise less likely in the short term.  The previous predictions, consistently showing a higher probability of a price drop, further support this assessment. The fact that many models are converging on similar conclusions increases the confidence in this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. due to multiple analyst downgrades, significant declines in iPhone sales (especially in China), and the lack of expected growth from AI features. The stock has already seen a substantial drop in January, and the downgrades from reputable firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, along with lowered guidance expectations, suggest continued bearish sentiment. While Apple still retains some buy ratings, the overall consensus is weakening, and the stock's performance metrics indicate a higher likelihood of further decline in the near term. The upcoming earnings report next week could amplify these concerns if the data confirms the negative trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has received analyst downgrades due to concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the failure of artificial intelligence to act as a growth catalyst. The stock has already experienced a significant decline, dropping 3.2% on Tuesday, 11% in January, and 14% from its December peak. More than $110 billion was erased from its market capitalization, causing it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies, along with weak iPhone sales data (-18.2% in China, -5% globally), suggest a negative short-term outlook. While 60% of analysts still recommend buying, this is lower than other megacap tech stocks, and the consensus rating has dropped to its lowest since May. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be low, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. due to concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of growth catalysts from AI. Multiple analyst downgrades, including those from Loop Capital and Jefferies, have contributed to this negative outlook. The stock has already experienced a significant decline in January and from its December peak, with more than $110 billion erased from its market capitalization. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which consistently show a higher probability of the stock price falling, and the current negative sentiment amongst analysts, I estimate a low probability of the stock price rising and a high probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and significant concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors have led to a noticeable decline in the stock price, with a significant drop in January and additional downgrades from major analysts. While some analysts still maintain buy ratings, the overall sentiment is heavily bearish. Given the continued negative outlook and the fact that a large portion of Apple's revenue is derived from iPhones, there is a high probability of continued downward pressure on the stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
