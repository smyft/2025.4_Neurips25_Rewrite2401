(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI. Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention.\nNews Content: It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Pay Attention. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that the majority of the largest companies in the world, including Apple, are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), which is recognized as a major driver of market growth. This development is expected to enhance Apple's product offerings and competitive positioning in a growing market. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of diversification, suggesting that AI stocks, including Apple, represent a strong investment opportunity for growth. Given the positive sentiment surrounding AI, it is likely that investors will be more inclined to buy Apple shares, leading to an upward movement in its stock price. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple's involvement in AI through its development of 'Apple Intelligence.' While the article doesn't explicitly state Apple is a leader in AI like Nvidia or Google, it positions Apple as a major player leveraging AI within its ecosystem. The general sentiment of the article is positive towards AI-related stocks. The 'Double Down' ad mentioning Apple suggests potential for growth. However, the article also advocates for diversification, indicating some level of risk is involved in AI stocks. Given that Apple is already a mature and large company, the impact of AI development, while positive, might be less significant compared to pure AI plays like Nvidia. The fact that nearly all top 10 are AI movers means being one may be necessary not sufficient for outperformance. Overall, I expect a slight positive impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's involvement in AI development through its 'Apple Intelligence' initiative, integrated into its software ecosystem.  While the article focuses on the broader AI sector and the impressive growth of companies heavily invested in AI,  Apple's AI efforts are presented as a significant component of its overall strategy.  The article's positive tone toward AI stocks generally suggests a bullish sentiment, but the effect on Apple specifically isn't explicitly stated as dramatically positive. Apple's size and established market position mean that substantial shifts are less likely than for smaller, more nascent AI companies.  The probability of a price rise is therefore moderate, reflecting the positive association with AI but tempered by the less-specific nature of the news for Apple compared to companies like Nvidia.  The probability of a price fall is low, as the news doesn't present any negative factors impacting Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is among the top companies making significant strides in AI, specifically with its development of 'Apple Intelligence' to enhance consumer AI services within its ecosystem. Given Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and history of innovation, investors are likely to view this AI integration as a positive catalyst for future growth. The overall market trend shows AI-focused companies outperforming, and Apple's involvement in AI could attract more investment, driving the stock price higher. There is minimal negative sentiment or risk mentioned in the news that would indicate a potential stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the market and how the largest companies, including Apple, are making significant moves into AI. This trend is expected to drive the highest gains in the market, with the AI market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030. As Apple is one of the companies investing heavily in AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price. Additionally, the article notes that the top 10 companies, including Apple, have a combined market cap of over $19 trillion, which is significantly larger than the next tier of companies. This suggests that Apple's investment in AI is likely to be a key driver of its growth and stock price performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant investment by large tech companies in AI technologies, positioning Apple as one of them. Given Apple's track record and the trend towards AI-driven innovations, it is likely that such investments will positively influence investor sentiment and potentially boost the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
