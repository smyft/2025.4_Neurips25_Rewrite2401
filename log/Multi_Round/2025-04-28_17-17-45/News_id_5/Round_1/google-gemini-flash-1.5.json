      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Apple, Intel, Chevron, Exxon, Walgreens, AbbVie, Deckers, Atlassian, Vertex, and More\nNews Content: Apple stock rises after the tech giant posts better-than-expected earnings and guides for solid growth, Intel edges higher after revenue projections miss analysts\u2019 estimates, and Chevron posts adjusted earnings below expectations.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has reported better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which typically leads to positive market reactions and investor confidence. This indicates a high likelihood of the stock price rising. Given the generally optimistic sentiment around Apple due to its performance, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly lower.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after reporting better-than-expected earnings and providing solid growth guidance. This suggests positive market sentiment and increased investor confidence. While overall stock market movement can be influenced by various factors, positive earnings reports and strong guidance are generally strong indicators of upward price movement. Therefore, the probability of the price rising is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight that Apple stock rose after reporting better-than-expected earnings and providing positive guidance for future growth.  This is a strong positive indicator for the stock's short-term performance. While other companies' performance is mentioned, the focus on Apple's positive results suggests a higher probability of continued upward movement, at least in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release.  However, it's important to remember that market sentiment and other unforeseen factors can influence stock prices.  Therefore, a probability of 1.0 is not assigned, but rather a high probability is assigned reflecting the positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after posting better-than-expected earnings and providing solid growth guidance. This positive earnings report and optimistic future outlook are likely to instill confidence in investors, leading to increased demand for the stock. Historically, better-than-expected earnings and strong guidance are bullish signals for a stock. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news states that Apple stock rises after the company posts better-than-expected earnings and guides for solid growth. This indicates a positive response from investors to the company's financial performance, suggesting that the stock price will likely continue to rise due to this news. The fact that other companies mentioned in the news, such as Intel and Chevron, had mixed results does not directly impact Apple's stock price movement in this context.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This is a strong positive signal.  All previous models, except one that failed, predicted a high probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.75 to 0.85.  While the market is complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond this news, the overwhelmingly positive initial reaction and strong earnings report suggest the upward momentum is likely to continue in the short term. I'm incorporating the consensus from previous models, but acknowledging that complete certainty is impossible.  The probability of a price rise is therefore weighted heavily towards the higher end of the previous predictions, while the chance for a fall remains low. \",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Apple, Intel, Chevron, Exxon, Walgreens, AbbVie, Deckers, Atlassian, Vertex, and More\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.88,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.12\n}\n```\n"
