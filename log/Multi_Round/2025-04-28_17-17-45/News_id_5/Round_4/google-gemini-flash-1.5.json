      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Apple, Intel, Chevron, Exxon, Walgreens, AbbVie, Deckers, Atlassian, Vertex, and More\nNews Content: Apple stock rises after the tech giant posts better-than-expected earnings and guides for solid growth, Intel edges higher after revenue projections miss analysts\u2019 estimates, and Chevron posts adjusted earnings below expectations.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has reported better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which typically leads to positive market reactions and investor confidence. This indicates a high likelihood of the stock price rising. Given the generally optimistic sentiment around Apple due to its performance, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly lower.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after reporting better-than-expected earnings and providing solid growth guidance. This suggests positive market sentiment and increased investor confidence. While overall stock market movement can be influenced by various factors, positive earnings reports and strong guidance are generally strong indicators of upward price movement. Therefore, the probability of the price rising is high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight that Apple stock rose after reporting better-than-expected earnings and providing positive guidance for future growth.  This is a strong positive indicator for the stock's short-term performance. While other companies' performance is mentioned, the focus on Apple's positive results suggests a higher probability of continued upward movement, at least in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release.  However, it's important to remember that market sentiment and other unforeseen factors can influence stock prices.  Therefore, a probability of 1.0 is not assigned, but rather a high probability is assigned reflecting the positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after posting better-than-expected earnings and providing solid growth guidance. This positive earnings report and optimistic future outlook are likely to instill confidence in investors, leading to increased demand for the stock. Historically, better-than-expected earnings and strong guidance are bullish signals for a stock. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news states that Apple stock rises after the company posts better-than-expected earnings and guides for solid growth. This indicates a positive response from investors to the company's financial performance, suggesting that the stock price will likely continue to rise due to this news. The fact that other companies mentioned in the news, such as Intel and Chevron, had mixed results does not directly impact Apple's stock price movement in this context.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth. This is typically seen as positive news for stock prices as it signals strong current performance and promising future prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which typically leads to increased investor confidence and positive market sentiment. The consistent high probabilities from previous predictions, indicating strong expectations for price increase, support the view that the stock will likely rise. Additionally, despite mixed results from other companies mentioned, the focus remains on Apple's positive performance. Therefore, a high probability of the stock price rising is assigned, while the probability of it falling remains low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The existing predictions uniformly lean towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, driven by better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance. This is a strong fundamental indicator that investors generally react positively to. The previous rounds indicate substantial investor confidence due to the reported earning. Incorporating the consistent bullish sentiment from prior predictions, I will adjust probabilities to reflect a continued, though slightly moderated, positive outlook, accounting for potential market corrections or profit-taking.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.88, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.12, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's stock rose after exceeding earnings expectations and providing positive growth guidance.  This is a strong positive signal.  All previous models, except one that failed, predicted a high probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.75 to 0.85.  While the market is complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond this news, the overwhelmingly positive initial reaction and strong earnings report suggest the upward momentum is likely to continue in the short term. I'm incorporating the consensus from previous models, but acknowledging that complete certainty is impossible.  The probability of a price rise is therefore weighted heavily towards the higher end of the previous predictions, while the chance for a fall remains low. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance. This positive financial performance and optimistic outlook are strong indicators that the stock price will continue to rise in the short term. The consensus among previous predictions also supports this view, with most models assigning a high probability (0.75-0.85) to the stock price rising and a low probability (0.15-0.25) to it falling. The mixed results of other companies mentioned in the news do not appear to negatively impact Apple's stock movement. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling remains low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The financial news reports that Apple's stock rises after the company posts better-than-expected earnings and guides for solid growth. This positive earnings report and optimistic future outlook are likely to instill confidence in investors, leading to increased demand for the stock. Historically, better-than-expected earnings and strong guidance are bullish signals for a stock. While other companies mentioned in the news had mixed results, the focus on Apple's positive performance suggests a higher probability of continued upward movement. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be high, while the probability of it falling is estimated to be low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. has reported better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which is typically seen as positive news for stock prices. This suggests a high likelihood of the stock price rising due to increased investor confidence and positive market sentiment. The previous predictions from other models also support this analysis, with a majority predicting a high probability of the stock price rising. Considering this information, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance. Previous predictions have consistently indicated a high probability of the stock price rising based on similar positive news. The market response to such news is generally positive due to increased investor confidence. Although other factors could influence the stock price, the current data points strongly towards a rising stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has reported better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which has historically resulted in positive market sentiment and increased investor confidence. Previous predictions reflect a consistent sentiment toward a positive outlook, suggesting a high likelihood of the stock price rising. Given the consensus from various models and the positive developments in Apple's performance, a high probability for an increase in stock price is justified, while the likelihood of a price decrease remains low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: Apple's stock reacted positively to better-than-expected earnings and solid growth guidance. This is a strong bullish signal. All previous models also predicted a high probability of price rise in the previous rounds, ranging from 0.75 to 0.88. Though there might be other factors that influence the stock price, Apple's performance and positive reactions by others suggest the continuation of the rise is very likely in the foreseen short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance, leading to an immediate stock price increase.  All previous prediction models (except one that failed) overwhelmingly favored a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.75 to 0.88. This consensus reflects strong positive market sentiment. Although market volatility and external factors could influence the price, the strong earnings report and growth outlook are dominant indicators.  The slight increase in predicted probability of a rise in round 1 further emphasizes investor confidence. Therefore, I assign a high probability to a stock price increase, acknowledging a small chance of a fall due to unforeseen circumstances or profit-taking.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which is a strong positive signal for the stock. Historical trends and market reactions to such news typically result in a stock price rise due to increased investor confidence. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently show a high probability of the stock price rising (ranging from 0.75 to 0.88) and a low probability of it falling (ranging from 0.12 to 0.25). Given the overwhelming consensus and the positive fundamental indicators, the probability of the stock price rising remains high, while the probability of a fall is low. The slightly upward adjustment in probabilities in Round 1 reflects continued optimism and reduced uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.83, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.17, Reasoning: Based on the financial news that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, the stock price is likely to rise. The consistent positive predictions from previous models, with probabilities ranging from 0.75 to 0.88 for a price rise, indicate strong investor confidence and market sentiment. Although other companies mentioned in the news had mixed results, the focus on Apple's positive performance suggests a higher probability of continued upward movement. Therefore, considering the positive earnings report and optimistic future outlook, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc. has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance, which is typically seen as positive news for stock prices. This suggests a high likelihood of the stock price rising due to increased investor confidence and positive market sentiment. The previous predictions from other models also support this analysis, with a majority predicting a high probability of the stock price rising. Considering this information and the trend of others' beliefs, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. posted better-than-expected earnings and provided solid growth guidance. Previous predictions have consistently shown a high probability of the stock price rising based on similar positive news. The market response to such news is generally positive due to increased investor confidence. Although other factors could influence the stock price, the current data points strongly towards a rising stock price. There is still some minor variation in previous predictions, but the dominant sentiment is bullish. Therefore, a conservative high probability of a price rise is assigned, while the probability of it falling remains low.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has reported better-than-expected earnings along with solid growth guidance, which typically leads to a positive market response and heightened investor confidence. Analyzing previous predictions, the consensus reflects a strong sentiment towards a price increase, with probabilities predominantly indicating high likelihoods of rising stock prices and low probabilities of declines. Other companies mentioned in the news do not negatively impact Apple\u2019s positive outlook. Thus, the overall sentiment remains bullish for Apple\u2019s stock price in the immediate future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.86, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.14, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has consistently demonstrated strong performance by reporting better-than-expected earnings and providing positive growth guidance. The market has reacted favorably to this news, as evidenced by the initial rise in the stock price. Previous predictions across various models have consistently indicated a high probability of the stock price increasing, with probabilities ranging from 0.75 to 0.88. Considering the sustained positive sentiment, Apple's robust financials, and the consensus from previous predictions, I predict a high probability of the stock price rising. While unforeseen market fluctuations can always impact stock prices, the available information strongly suggests continued upward momentum.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.88, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.12, Reasoning: Apple's better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance are strong bullish signals, as evidenced by the initial stock price rise and the overwhelmingly positive predictions from multiple AI models across three rounds.  The consistent upward trend in predicted probabilities of a price rise (from an average of around 0.8 in Round 0 to around 0.85 in Round 2) demonstrates a strengthening consensus among these models. While market factors beyond this specific news could influence the price, the strong fundamental data and consistent AI predictions point to a high probability of continued upward movement in the short term. I've slightly moderated the probability compared to the highest predictions to account for potential market corrections or profit-taking, but the overall outlook remains strongly positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The financial news reports that Apple Inc.
