(AAPL) as one of them. However, Apple is known for its investments and advancements in AI technology. The mention of AI could have a neutral to slightly positive effect on Apple's stock price as it implies continued relevance in the tech industry. But since Apple is not explicitly mentioned as one of the stocks, the impact might be limited. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced with a slight bias towards a positive reaction due to the general positive sentiment around AI investments.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett Has $74 Billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $301 Billion Portfolio Tied Up in 2 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45,\n}\n```"
