As one of the leading AI stocks, Apple's involvement in AI could potentially benefit from this investment strategy. Given Warren Buffett's reputation as a value investor and his long-term investment approach, his confidence in AI and companies like Apple could positively influence investor sentiment. This could lead to an increase in Apple's stock price as investors might view the company more favorably due to its association with AI and Buffett's endorsement.
