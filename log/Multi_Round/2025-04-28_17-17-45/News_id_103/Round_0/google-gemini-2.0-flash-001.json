The phrases 'printing money' implies strong fundamentals and potential upward pressure on the stock.

Given the conflicting signals, the 'still printing money' part is slightly more crucial, but not overwhelmingly so. There is no clear prediction of positive or negative influence but it indicates a slightly more positive impact on the stock as there is money printing.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Should Investors Load Up on Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
