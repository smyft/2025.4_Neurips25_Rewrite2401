(AAPL)\nNews Headline: T-Mobile, Apple, HPE: Top Stocks\nNews Content: Morning Brief co-anchors Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down today's top trending stock stories on Yahoo Finance.\n\nApple (AAPL) and T-Mobile (TMUS) have been working with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink into iPhones which could enhance Apple's product offerings and customer satisfaction. The mention of a significant software update (iOS 18.3) that supports Starlink features is likely to be positively received among consumers and investors, suggesting a strong potential for market interest. Additionally, T-Mobile reported strong earnings, which is likely a positive indicator for the partnership's success. Given this context, I estimate a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, while the likelihood of falling is lower due to this positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed but leans positive. The integration with Starlink is potentially a long-term positive, suggesting innovation and future revenue streams. The iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features is a concrete positive development. The overall market sentiment and how investors perceive the value of Starlink integration will play a crucial role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news piece highlights several factors impacting Apple. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update is a positive development, potentially boosting sales and attracting new customers. This is a significant technological advancement that could enhance the user experience and Apple's competitive edge. However, the news mentions this alongside other unrelated stories about other companies, and lacks specific details about the market impact of Starlink integration on sales figures.  Therefore, while the Starlink integration is positive, its impact on the stock price isn't immediately clear and needs further market reaction, so the probability of a rise is moderate. There is no negative news directly related to Apple in this specific report; hence, the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive higher iPhone sales. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this update, which suggests a bullish sentiment. The probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall due to the positive nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. The latest iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts is also a positive sign. There is no negative news about Apple in the article. Therefore, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to this news. The news about T-Mobile's earnings and HPE's antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple working with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones could be seen as positive, potentially driving innovation and future business opportunities. However, the news does not provide immediate financial impact details. On the other hand, T-Mobile exceeding Wall Street expectations could positively influence investor sentiment. Since the news directly relates to Apple's activities with Starlink but does not provide clear financial indicators, the stock movement probability is relatively neutral. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's potential antitrust concerns could negatively impact investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones through the latest iOS update, which is likely to enhance Apple's product offerings and customer satisfaction. The integration of innovative technology like Starlink could attract more users and potentially boost sales, thus positively impacting investor sentiment. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong earnings may contribute to a favorable view on partnerships involving Apple. There are no direct negative news impacts on Apple, making it reasonable to expect a higher probability of stock price rise. However, some uncertainties remain about the immediate financial impact of the Starlink integration, which moderates the overall positive outlook slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.76, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.24, Reasoning: The core news focuses on Apple's integration of Starlink into iPhones via iOS 18.3. This is a positive development, potentially enhancing user experience and creating a 'wow' factor for consumers. The fact that it's integrated in 'images, music, and podcasts' indicates it's more than just a gimmick and offers real functionality. T-Mobile's strong earnings further reinforce the narrative of successful integration, at least from the telco side. Considering the consistently positive appraisals from the previous rounds which hover primarily between 60% and 75%, and the lack of negative information relating to Apple, I'll lean slightly more positive than neutral, while also acknowledging that real impact needs time to become apparent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple. The Starlink integration, supported by the iOS 18.3 update, is a significant technological advancement that could enhance the user experience and attract new customers.  While the long-term impact needs to be seen, it's a positive development. The previous predictions largely agree on a higher chance of a price increase, ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The strong T-Mobile earnings, though indirectly related, contribute to a positive overall market sentiment which may benefit Apple as well.  However, the lack of concrete immediate financial implications of the Starlink integration and the overall vagueness of the news piece prevent assigning an extremely high probability to a price increase.  Therefore, I assign a moderate probability of price increase, slightly higher than the probability of a fall due to the lack of any negative news directly impacting Apple. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones, which is a significant positive development. The latest iOS 18.3 update supports Starlink features, enhancing Apple's product ecosystem and potentially driving higher iPhone sales and customer satisfaction. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong earnings report could further bolster investor confidence in the partnership. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this report. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most estimates ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive higher iPhone sales. The update supports Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts, which is a concrete positive development. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this update. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the potential for future revenue streams, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. The latest iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts is also a positive sign. There is no negative news about Apple in the article. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this positive news, the overall sentiment is bullish. However, to account for potential market uncertainties and the lack of immediate financial impact details, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a moderate level of confidence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones through the iOS 18.3 update. This development is expected to positively impact Apple by enhancing its product offerings and customer satisfaction. T-Mobile's strong earnings report also adds positive sentiment towards the tech sector, indirectly benefiting Apple. While Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s antitrust concerns do not directly affect Apple, they could introduce a slight negative sentiment to the broader tech space. Overall, the positive developments related to Apple seem to outweigh the potential negative externalities.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX for Starlink integration, which enhances their product offerings and aligns with consumer demand for innovative technology. The iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features can positively impact user experience and attract new customers. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong earnings provide a favorable backdrop for Apple's performance. There are no negative aspects directly impacting Apple's stock in the news, leading to a bullish sentiment. While there is some uncertainty regarding the immediate financial impact, the overall positive developments suggest a higher probability of stock price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The consistent positive sentiment regarding Apple's integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones continues to drive a bullish outlook. iOS 18.3 supporting Starlink across multiple features suggests significant investment and potential user engagement. T-Mobile's strong earnings further solidify the positive momentum. Previous predictions have consistently favored a price increase, ranging from 55% to 76%. No negative news directly impacts Apple, solidifying a high probability for a price rise. I am increasing the probability slightly, given the continued positive analyses but still accounting for market uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple. The integration of Starlink connectivity via iOS 18.3 is a significant technological advancement with potential long-term benefits.  This enhances user experience and may attract new customers.  However, the immediate financial impact is unclear.  T-Mobile's strong earnings provide some positive spillover effect. The consistent upward trend in previous predictions, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, also supports a positive outlook.  While there's no direct negative news about Apple, the lack of concrete short-term financial details prevents assigning an extremely high probability to a price increase. I've considered the overall positive sentiment and the potential for future revenue streams, while acknowledging the absence of immediately quantifiable impacts on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones, supported by the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive higher iPhone sales and customer satisfaction. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong earnings report adds positive sentiment to the partnership. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this report. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most estimates ranging from 0.6 to 0.76. Given the positive developments and the absence of negative factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update.

T-Mobile's strong earnings report adds to the positive sentiment. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this report. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the potential for future revenue streams, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall. The previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most estimates ranging from 0.6 to 0.76. Given this context, I estimate a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update, which is a positive development for the company.
