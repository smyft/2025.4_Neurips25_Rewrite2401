      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: T-Mobile, Apple, HPE: Top Stocks\nNews Content: Morning Brief co-anchors Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down today's top trending stock stories on Yahoo Finance.\n\nApple (AAPL) and T-Mobile (TMUS) have been working with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones. The latest iOS 18.3 update now supports Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) representatives met with the Trump administration to discuss antitrust concerns regarding the company's $14 billion bid to acquire Juniper Networks (JNPR), according to Bloomberg.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink into iPhones which could enhance Apple's product offerings and customer satisfaction. The mention of a significant software update (iOS 18.3) that supports Starlink features is likely to be positively received among consumers and investors, suggesting a strong potential for market interest. Additionally, T-Mobile reported strong earnings, which is likely a positive indicator for the partnership's success. Given this context, I estimate a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, while the likelihood of falling is lower due to this positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed but leans positive. The integration with Starlink is potentially a long-term positive, suggesting innovation and future revenue streams. The iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features is a concrete positive development. The overall market sentiment and how investors perceive the value of Starlink integration will play a crucial role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news piece highlights several factors impacting Apple. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update is a positive development, potentially boosting sales and attracting new customers. This is a significant technological advancement that could enhance the user experience and Apple's competitive edge. However, the news mentions this alongside other unrelated stories about other companies, and lacks specific details about the market impact of Starlink integration on sales figures.  Therefore, while the Starlink integration is positive, its impact on the stock price isn't immediately clear and needs further market reaction, so the probability of a rise is moderate. There is no negative news directly related to Apple in this specific report; hence, the probability of a fall is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive higher iPhone sales. There is no negative news directly affecting Apple in this update, which suggests a bullish sentiment. The probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall due to the positive nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's collaboration with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity on iPhones, which is a positive development for the company. The latest iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features across images, music, and podcasts is also a positive sign. There is no negative news about Apple in the article. Therefore, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to this news. The news about T-Mobile's earnings and HPE's antitrust concerns does not directly affect Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple working with SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones could be seen as positive, potentially driving innovation and future business opportunities. However, the news does not provide immediate financial impact details. On the other hand, T-Mobile exceeding Wall Street expectations could positively influence investor sentiment. Since the news directly relates to Apple's activities with Starlink but does not provide clear financial indicators, the stock movement probability is relatively neutral. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's potential antitrust concerns could negatively impact investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
