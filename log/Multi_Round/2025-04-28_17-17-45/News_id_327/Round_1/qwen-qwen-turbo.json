(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The UBS report identifies Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred investment choices for 2025, which may lead to increased investor sentiment towards these companies. However, it specifically advises against IBM and Pure Storage, stating limited upside potential for their stocks. The mention of Apple in the context of IBM and Pure Storage suggests a cautious view, as their performance is not linked to significant AI revenue. Given that Apple is indirectly associated with a negative outlook, the probabilities reflect market sentiment towards the stock. Current broader market dynamics and sentiments about AI and tech are also considered.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. While Apple is mentioned in passing, the context is negative, stating 'limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025.' This suggests that UBS analysts aren't expecting positive revisions for Apple's stock price in 2025 due to limited AI exposure. This general comment without detailed analysis makes a substantial impact on estimated probabilities harder. The lack of specific targets or further explanation decreases the weighting of the claim to the overall probability calculation. Given that Apple is primarily driven by consumer electronics like iPhones, the immediate impact is low. However, if investors weigh this lack of AI upside as a significant downside, we may see some initial negative reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025 due to their expected growth in the AI server market and recovering end markets.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in the context of having minimal AI-related revenue in 2025, placing it in the same category as IBM and Pure Storage.  This suggests that the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it implies a lack of significant growth drivers related to the booming AI sector in the short-term (2025). While the lack of negative news is positive, the lack of positive news specifically related to Apple diminishes the likelihood of a price increase directly resulting from this report. The analysis focuses on other companies and doesn't provide specific reasons for a positive or negative Apple outlook beyond the lack of AI revenue impact in 2025.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article from UBS provides a sector outlook focusing on enterprise hardware and networking, with specific recommendations for 2025. While the headline and much of the content emphasize Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks and IBM and Pure Storage as least favored, Apple (AAPL) is mentioned briefly in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue in 2025. This suggests that AAPL may not benefit from the AI-driven growth expected in the sector, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's stock performance is influenced by many factors beyond this single report, and its strong brand, diversified product line, and financial health may mitigate negative effects. Given the limited direct negative mention and Apple's broader market position, the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Specifically, UBS mentions that Apple (AAPL) has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth potential from AI. This could negatively impact Apple's stock price as investors seek companies with higher AI exposure and growth potential. The news does not provide directly positive information about Apple, which could lead to a relatively negative outlook for the stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's top picks for 2025, which include Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Although Apple is mentioned in the article, it is not directly recommended or advised against. The article states that Apple, along with IBM and Pure Storage, has minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, which may limit upside revisions. However, this information is not directly related to a buy or sell recommendation for Apple. Given the lack of direct positive or negative recommendation for Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced, but with a slight inclination towards a fall due to the mention of limited AI-related revenue exposure.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights UBS's recommendation for Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage for the year 2025. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of companies with limited AI-related revenue exposure, the focus is primarily on Dell and TD SYNNEX, suggesting a positive outlook for these companies. There is no specific positive or negative mention about Apple Inc., but the general sentiment could reflect broader market conditions, where Apple may be seen as having stable but less exciting prospects compared to Dell and TD SYNNEX.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
