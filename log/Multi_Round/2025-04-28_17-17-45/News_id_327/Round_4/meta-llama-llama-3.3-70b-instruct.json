(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Buy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Dell (NYSE:DELL) and TD SYNNEX (NYSE:SNX) are UBS's top picks for 2025, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) are listed as least favored, the bank revealed in its enterprise hardware and networking sector outlook.\n\nUBS names Dell as the preferred large-cap stock for the year, noting it \u201cshould be a winner in the AI server market relative to peer Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) across Tier 2 Cloud and Enterprise markets,\u201d the report states.\n\nUBS anticipates at least 10% revenue growth in Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) for 2025. Furthermore, a projected recovery in the PC market by at least 5% is expected to push Dell\u2019s free cash flow up 15% for the year and into low double digits in 2026.\n\nWith the company\u2019s shares trading at 12% of estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF), \u201cthe risk-reward is highly favorable given the synchronous recovery in end-markets next year,\u201d UBS analysts led by David Vogt said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, TD SYNNEX stands out as the firm\u2019s preferred mid-cap stock. UBS forecasts 5% growth in billings, driven by recovering end markets in PCs, networking, servers, and storage.\n\nThe company is also expected to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, shrinking its share count by approximately 5% and driving 10% earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n\nAnalysts also highlight the strength of TD SYNNEX\u2019s AI infrastructure business, Hyve, which is projected to reach several billion dollars in revenue with operating margins exceeding corporate averages.\n\n\u201cAs the market properly values this unit, we expect TD SYNNEX\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to expand from 9x to more in-line with legacy tech peers around 10-12x,\u201d analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts advise against IBM and Pure Storage stocks in 2025, citing limited upside.\n\nThe note highlights that while AI-driven growth is selective, IBM and Pure Storage have minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWhile heavily exposed AI names should see upward revisions in CY25, we expect limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,\u201d analysts highlighted.\n\nUBS also highlights IBM\u2019s second-half-weighted 2025 earnings profile and the risk of a Q1 EPS miss, calling it \u201can unfavorable risk/reward in our view\u201d with the stock trading at 21x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage\u2019s share loss in all-flash and soft demand for Everrgreen//One subscriptions represent growth headwinds for 2025, analysts said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy Dell and TD SYNNEX shares in 2025, avoid IBM, Pure Storage: UBS\n\nBlinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations\n\nUS adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The UBS report identifies Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred investment choices for 2025, which may lead to increased investor sentiment towards these companies. However, it specifically advises against IBM and Pure Storage, stating limited upside potential for their stocks. The mention of Apple in the context of IBM and Pure Storage suggests a cautious view, as their performance is not linked to significant AI revenue. Given that Apple is indirectly associated with a negative outlook, the probabilities reflect market sentiment towards the stock. Current broader market dynamics and sentiments about AI and tech are also considered.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article is primarily focused on Dell and TD SYNNEX, with negative sentiment towards IBM and Pure Storage. While Apple is mentioned in passing, the context is negative, stating 'limited upside revisions (absent acquisitions) at IBM, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Pure Storage given de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025.' This suggests that UBS analysts aren't expecting positive revisions for Apple's stock price in 2025 due to limited AI exposure. This general comment without detailed analysis makes a substantial impact on estimated probabilities harder. The lack of specific targets or further explanation decreases the weighting of the claim to the overall probability calculation. Given that Apple is primarily driven by consumer electronics like iPhones, the immediate impact is low. However, if investors weigh this lack of AI upside as a significant downside, we may see some initial negative reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025 due to their expected growth in the AI server market and recovering end markets.  Conversely, the report advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and other headwinds.  Apple is mentioned only in the context of having minimal AI-related revenue in 2025, placing it in the same category as IBM and Pure Storage.  This suggests that the news is mildly negative for Apple, as it implies a lack of significant growth drivers related to the booming AI sector in the short-term (2025). While the lack of negative news is positive, the lack of positive news specifically related to Apple diminishes the likelihood of a price increase directly resulting from this report. The analysis focuses on other companies and doesn't provide specific reasons for a positive or negative Apple outlook beyond the lack of AI revenue impact in 2025.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article from UBS provides a sector outlook focusing on enterprise hardware and networking, with specific recommendations for 2025. While the headline and much of the content emphasize Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks and IBM and Pure Storage as least favored, Apple (AAPL) is mentioned briefly in the context of having minimal exposure to AI-related revenue in 2025. This suggests that AAPL may not benefit from the AI-driven growth expected in the sector, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's stock performance is influenced by many factors beyond this single report, and its strong brand, diversified product line, and financial health may mitigate negative effects. Given the limited direct negative mention and Apple's broader market position, the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss UBS's recommendations for 2025, favoring Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Specifically, UBS mentions that Apple (AAPL) has 'de minimis AI related revenue/exposure in 2025,' implying limited growth potential from AI. This could negatively impact Apple's stock price as investors seek companies with higher AI exposure and growth potential. The news does not provide directly positive information about Apple, which could lead to a relatively negative outlook for the stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses UBS's top picks for 2025, which include Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Although Apple is mentioned in the article, it is not directly recommended or advised against. The article states that Apple, along with IBM and Pure Storage, has minimal exposure to AI revenue for the year, which may limit upside revisions. However, this information is not directly related to a buy or sell recommendation for Apple. Given the lack of direct positive or negative recommendation for Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced, but with a slight inclination towards a fall due to the mention of limited AI-related revenue exposure.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights UBS's recommendation for Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage for the year 2025. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of companies with limited AI-related revenue exposure, the focus is primarily on Dell and TD SYNNEX, suggesting a positive outlook for these companies. There is no specific positive or negative mention about Apple Inc., but the general sentiment could reflect broader market conditions, where Apple may be seen as having stable but less exciting prospects compared to Dell and TD SYNNEX.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report highlights positive sentiment towards Dell and TD SYNNEX, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage due to limited growth potential, especially in relation to AI revenue. Although Apple is mentioned, it is grouped with IBM and Pure Storage regarding minimal AI exposure, suggesting a lack of positive growth catalysts. Therefore, sentiment around Apple is mildly negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to a rise, despite the absence of direct negative news on Apple itself.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The UBS report is mostly focused on other companies, not explicitly on Apple. Apple is mentioned only in the context of having limited AI revenue exposure. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment. Some models predicted a higher probability of falling due to the negative association with limited AI exposure, while others considered the lack of direct negative recommendation. Considering the mixed previous predictions and that the AI exposure is not the only factor that determines investors behavior, The probabilities prediction will be moderate falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, largely ignoring Apple's prospects.  Apple's inclusion is only in the context of limited AI revenue exposure for 2025, placing it alongside IBM and Pure Storage as companies with limited upside potential in the near term according to UBS. This is mildly negative news as it suggests a lack of significant growth drivers related to the booming AI sector during this timeframe.  However, this is not a strong negative; the absence of specific negative news about Apple offsets this.  The lack of positive news specifically related to Apple, coupled with the overall neutral to slightly negative sentiment from the report's focus on other companies, results in a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise.  Previous predictions range from 0.3 to 0.45 for the probability of a price rise and 0.55 to 0.7 for the probability of a price fall. Considering the consensus of the previous predictions and the limited direct impact of the news on Apple, I'm weighting the probability towards a slightly higher chance of a price fall given the lack of positive news and the mildly negative context in which it is mentioned. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The UBS report primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned in passing, with the report stating that it, along with IBM and Pure Storage, has minimal exposure to AI-related revenue in 2025. This suggests a neutral to slightly negative sentiment for Apple, as the lack of AI-driven growth could be seen as a downside in the current market environment. However, Apple's strong brand, diversified product line, and financial health may mitigate any negative impact. Given the limited direct mention and the broader context, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate, with a slight bias towards a negative reaction due to the lack of AI upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report highlights Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025 due to their expected growth in AI and recovering end markets. Conversely, it advises against IBM and Pure Storage, citing limited AI exposure and growth potential. Apple is mentioned briefly in the context of having minimal AI-related revenue exposure in 2025, which could limit its upside potential. However, there is no direct recommendation or significant analysis focused on Apple. Given the lack of specific positive or negative information about Apple's stock performance in 2025 and considering the general market sentiment towards AI-driven growth, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook. The UBS report's focus on AI exposure suggests that companies with significant AI revenue potential may see increased investment, while those with minimal exposure, like Apple, might be viewed less favorably in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and the predictions from other models indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly affected by the UBS report, which focuses on recommending Dell and TD SYNNEX while advising against IBM and Pure Storage. However, the mention of Apple alongside IBM and Pure Storage as having minimal AI-related revenue exposure in 2025 could imply a lack of significant growth drivers related to the AI sector. Considering the indirect and limited negative implication, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated. The overall market sentiment and the company's strong brand, diversified product line, and financial health are also taken into account. Given the balanced but slightly negative outlook from other models, the estimated probabilities lean towards a moderate negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as preferred investments for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage due to limited AI revenue exposure. Apple is mentioned in a similar context as having minimal AI-related revenue exposure. While Apple's performance is driven by multiple factors, the current news places it in a similar group of companies unlikely to benefit significantly from AI-driven growth. The lack of a specific recommendation or analysis for Apple suggests limited market optimism, particularly in a sector where AI exposure plays a key role.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report presents a cautious outlook towards Apple's growth potential in 2025 by categorizing it with companies like IBM and Pure Storage, which have minimal exposure to AI revenue. This context suggests a lack of significant growth drivers for Apple, particularly as investor focus shifts towards companies with stronger AI prospects such as Dell and TD SYNNEX. Although Apple\u2019s overall market position remains strong, the report's sentiment is slightly negative regarding its stock price movement. Hence, the probabilities reflect a moderate inclination towards a price fall due to limited positive catalysts from this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The UBS report is predominantly focused on other companies, offering buy recommendations for Dell and TD SYNNEX and advising against IBM and Pure Storage. Apple is only mentioned in the context of having limited AI revenue exposure in 2025, a point which is perceived as mildly negative. Considering previous rounds, there is a consensus that the implication on Apple is mildly negative as its stock's upside may be limited given the market excitement about the AI sector. I will keep my prediction consistent with the more conservative values that trend has established while leaning towards the belief that the news won't have a tremendous impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, largely ignoring Apple's prospects. Apple's mention is solely within the context of limited AI revenue exposure for 2025, grouping it with IBM and Pure Storage as having limited upside potential according to UBS. This is mildly negative, suggesting a lack of significant growth from the booming AI sector in the short term. However, this is not strongly negative; the lack of specific negative news somewhat offsets this.  The lack of positive news, coupled with the neutral-to-slightly-negative sentiment from the report's focus elsewhere, leads to a higher probability of a price fall.  Previous predictions show a range for price rise probability from 0.3 to 0.45 and for a price fall from 0.55 to 0.7. Considering the consensus and limited direct impact on Apple, the probability is weighted toward a higher chance of a price fall due to the absence of positive news and the mildly negative context of its mention. The overall market sentiment and Apple's strong brand, diverse product line, and financial health could considerably mitigate any negative impact.  However, the lack of any significant positive news related to the report makes a rise less likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025, highlighting their growth potential in AI and recovering end markets, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage due to limited AI exposure. Apple is mentioned in passing as having minimal AI-related revenue exposure in 2025, placing it in a similar category to IBM and Pure Storage.

However, Apple's strong brand, diversified product line, and financial health may mitigate any negative impact. Given the limited direct mention and the broader context, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate, with a slight bias towards a negative reaction due to the lack of AI upside. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, highlighting Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025 due to their expected growth in the AI server market and recovering end markets.

Apple is mentioned in a similar context as having minimal AI-related revenue exposure, which could imply a lack of significant growth drivers related to the AI sector.

The overall market sentiment and the company's strong brand, diversified product line, and financial health are also taken into account. Given the balanced but slightly negative outlook from other models, the estimated probabilities lean towards a moderate negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Dell and TD SYNNEX as positive picks for 2025, while Apple is mentioned only in the context of having minimal AI revenue exposure alongside IBM and Pure Storage. While Apple has a diversified product line and strong brand, the lack of positive news and the mention within the context of minimal AI revenue could negatively impact investor sentiment. Previous predictions suggest a general caution towards Apple due to this news, with probabilities ranging widely. The current analysis leans towards a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the emphasis on companies with strong AI exposure.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report highlights Dell and TD SYNNEX as beneficiaries of AI growth while categorizing Apple, IBM, and Pure Storage as having minimal AI-related exposure. This positioning implies a negative sentiment towards Apple's growth potential in the near term, as it lacks significant catalysts for price appreciation. Previous predictions have consistently indicated a slightly higher probability of price decline for Apple, given its association with companies expected to underperform in the AI sector. There are no strong positive indicators for Apple in this news, leading to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The UBS report doesn't directly address Apple's future prospects, but it mentions the company in the context of having limited AI revenue exposure alongside IBM and Pure Storage. While not overtly negative, this aligns Apple with companies facing a growth headwind in the current market enthusiasm for AI. Prior predictions have consistently leaned towards a slightly negative impact due to this perceived lack of AI upside, even considering Apple's other strengths. This mildly negative sentiment, combined with the lack of direct positive news about Apple in the report, suggest a greater chance of a slight price decrease than an increase because of this news. The analysis balances the acknowledgement of the slight negativity with Apple's strong fundamentals, ultimately concluding on a more limited downside effect. The probabilities are also influenced by the convergence of prior predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The UBS report focuses on the enterprise hardware and networking sector, giving strong positive signals to Dell and TD SYNNEX, and negative signals to IBM and Pure Storage. Apple is mentioned only in passing, grouped with IBM and Pure Storage as having minimal AI revenue exposure in 2025.  This is interpreted as mildly negative news because it suggests a lack of significant growth drivers related to the currently booming AI sector. However, it is not strongly negative; the absence of specific negative news about Apple partially offsets this.  The lack of positive news, coupled with the overall neutral-to-slightly-negative sentiment from the report's focus on other companies, results in a higher probability of a price fall than a rise. The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall (between 0.6 and 0.7), and I am weighting my prediction accordingly. Apple's strong brand, diverse product line, and robust financial health could mitigate any negative impact, but the lack of direct positive news from this report makes a rise less likely in the immediate term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The UBS report primarily focuses on Dell and TD SYNNEX as top picks for 2025, while advising against IBM and Pure Storage due to limited AI revenue exposure.
