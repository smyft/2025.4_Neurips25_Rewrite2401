(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with a strong track record in managing complex software projects, to the AI and machine learning division is a strategic move by Apple to improve its AI capabilities, especially in light of criticisms regarding Siri's performance. Although Apple's AI initiatives have encountered challenges and the company trails behind peers like OpenAI and Google, the internal restructuring suggests a focused effort on rapidly enhancing its AI functionalities. Improved management and expertise in the AI division could bolster investor confidence and potentially support stock price stability or increases. However, lingering challenges and the current mixed perception of Siri's effectiveness may temper enthusiasm, leading to a cautious outlook. Therefore, there is a moderate probability that the stock price will rise, but concerns about ongoing AI performance issues contribute to a reasonable probability of a price fall as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is taking steps to address its shortcomings in the AI space by bringing in a veteran executive with a proven track record of fixing troubled projects. While this move signals a renewed focus on AI, it also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI capabilities compared to its competitors. Vorrath's appointment could be viewed positively by investors as it suggests Apple is serious about improving its AI offerings, including Siri. However, the news also acknowledges past failures, criticisms, and the long road ahead (e.g., 'new version of Siri as part of iOS 18.4 in April', and 'even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface - something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026'). The mixed signals suggest a slightly positive but not overwhelmingly optimistic market reaction. The prior removal of inaccurate AI news recaps also negatively impacts the sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's efforts to improve its AI capabilities and Siri, areas where it has lagged behind competitors.  Apple's bringing in a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products suggests a serious commitment to addressing these shortcomings. While this is a positive development, the impact on stock price is likely to be muted.  The improvements in AI and Siri are long-term projects, and their success isn't guaranteed. The immediate market reaction is unlikely to be dramatic because the news doesn't announce any immediate new products or revenue streams.  Existing concerns about Apple's AI performance might persist until tangible improvements are demonstrated. Therefore, a small probability of a price rise is anticipated due to investor confidence in Apple's efforts, but a slight chance of a fall or no significant change is more likely due to the long-term nature of the improvements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI division by appointing Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive known for fixing troubled products and managing complex projects. This indicates Apple's commitment to improving its AI capabilities, particularly Siri, which has been a weak point compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Samsung. Vorrath's track record with major projects like the iPhone and Vision Pro suggests potential for positive impact. However, the news also underscores Apple's current lag in AI, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The market may view this as a positive step toward catching up, but the long timeline for significant improvements (e.g., the advanced Siri version not ready until 2026) could limit immediate upside. The recent AI missteps (e.g., inaccurate news recaps) add minor negative sentiment. Overall, the news is moderately positive but not transformative in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is bolstering its artificial intelligence (AI) and Siri teams with the appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran software executive, to help fix AI and Siri. This move suggests that Apple is serious about addressing its shortcomings in AI and improving Siri's capabilities. The company has struggled to match its peers in AI, and this change could potentially enhance its product offerings and competitiveness. However, the impact on the stock price will depend on how investors perceive the company's ability to innovate and catch up in the AI space. Given that the news focuses on internal improvements and personnel changes rather than revolutionary product launches or significant financial impacts, it's likely to have a moderately positive effect on the stock price as it indicates a proactive approach to AI development.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is taking steps to improve its AI and Siri capabilities by assigning a veteran software executive, Kim Vorrath, to help fix these areas. This move suggests that Apple is committed to enhancing its AI offerings and addressing its shortcomings in this space. The appointment of Vorrath, who has a track record of successfully managing complex software projects, could lead to improvements in Apple's AI and Siri. As a result, investors may view this development positively, potentially leading to a rise in the stock price. However, the news also highlights the challenges Apple faces in AI, including criticism of Siri's current capabilities and the company's lag behind peers. This could temper enthusiasm and lead to a more neutral market reaction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has a new executive in the AI division, Kim Vorrath, who is known for her expertise in program management and product development. This suggests that Apple is doubling down on improving its AI and Siri, areas where it has lagged behind competitors. While it acknowledges current shortcomings, it also highlights future improvements and updates planned for the upcoming year, including potential enhancements to Siri. These developments could positively impact investor sentiment as they suggest a strategic push towards addressing key challenges in crucial technological areas.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to enhance Apple's AI and Siri capabilities signals a strategic effort to address long-standing shortcomings in these areas. While Vorrath's track record and expertise suggest potential for improvement, the news also acknowledges the challenges that Apple faces, especially in comparison to competitors. The timeline for significant enhancements to Siri and AI functions stretches into several years, which may temper immediate investor enthusiasm. Overall, the internal restructuring seems a positive step that could lead to optimism, but concerns about current AI capabilities persist, leading to a balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news of Apple assigning Kim Vorrath to fix its AI and Siri is generally positive, as evidenced by the majority of previous model predictions leaning towards a stock price rise. However, it's important to note that the news also highlights Apple's past shortcomings in AI and the long-term nature of the improvements. The previous round shows the probability of stock price rising varies from 0.3 to 0.7. Considering that the appointment signifies Apple's commitment to addressing AI issues, but also acknowledges delays and the challenging road ahead, I predict a slightly moderated increase in the probability of a rise, as some models have taken into account of the negative factors. I'm slightly decreasing the price falling to reflect the positive overall market sentiments toward the appointment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing Kim Vorrath to improve its AI and Siri capabilities is a mixed bag.  While it signals a proactive effort to address known weaknesses and suggests a commitment to AI improvement, the impact on the stock price is likely to be muted in the short term.  The improvements are long-term projects, and their success isn't guaranteed. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but even the most optimistic predictions are below 0.7. The fact that tangible improvements are still months or years away (new Siri features in April 2025, advanced Siri not until 2026) tempers any immediate positive market reaction. The recent negative press surrounding inaccurate AI-generated news recaps further adds a layer of caution. Considering the long-term nature of the improvements and the mixed signals from this news, I predict a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall, but the difference is small, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in this situation. The previous predictions, averaging around 0.57 for a rise, also inform this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI division by appointing Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive with a strong track record in managing complex software projects. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its AI shortcomings, particularly with Siri, which has been criticized for lagging behind competitors like OpenAI and Google. Vorrath's appointment is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it signals a serious effort to improve AI capabilities, potentially boosting confidence in Apple's future AI advancements. However, the news also underscores Apple's current lag in AI and the long timeline for significant improvements (e.g., advanced Siri features not ready until 2026), which could temper immediate enthusiasm. Additionally, recent AI missteps, such as inaccurate news recaps, add minor negative sentiment.

Vorrath's track record of managing complex software projects and bringing major projects to market is a positive factor. However, the news also highlights existing challenges and the long timeline for significant improvements, which may temper immediate enthusiasm. Overall, the appointment suggests a proactive approach to addressing AI shortcomings, which could lead to a moderately positive market reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran software executive, to help fix AI and Siri at Apple Inc. is a strategic move that indicates the company's commitment to improving its AI capabilities. While Apple has faced challenges and criticisms regarding its AI performance, particularly with Siri, the move suggests a proactive approach to addressing these shortcomings. The mixed signals from the news, including the acknowledgement of past failures and the long-term nature of the improvements, contribute to a cautious outlook. However, the positive development of bringing in a seasoned executive with a track record of successfully managing complex software projects could lead to improvements in Apple's AI and Siri, potentially enhancing investor sentiment. Considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced view, taking into account both the positive implications of the appointment and the ongoing challenges in the AI space.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple enlisting a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, known for fixing troubled products, to address AI and Siri shortcomings. This strategic move signals Apple\u2019s intention to enhance AI capabilities, which have been criticized in comparison to competitors like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. While it reflects ongoing struggles, Vorrath\u2019s experience and Apple\u2019s track record in major projects suggest potential improvements. The mixed signals create cautious optimism, with some concern over the long-term timelines for significant improvements and past missteps, which may limit immediate investor enthusiasm.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a seasoned executive with a strong record in fixing troubled projects, reflects Apple's commitment to improving its AI capabilities, particularly with Siri, which has struggled against competitors. This strategic move may enhance investor confidence in Apple's future AI advancements. However, the acknowledgment of past shortcomings, the long timeline for meaningful improvements, and the recent negative press surrounding AI-related issues temper immediate optimism. Considering the overall positive sentiment from Vorrath's hiring versus the ongoing challenges facing Apple's AI, a slightly more bullish outlook is justified. Based on the previous predictions, a moderate probability of stock price rise is estimated, alongside an acknowledged risk of price falls due to the challenges discussed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of Apple assigning Kim Vorrath to improve its AI capabilities is a mixed signal. On one hand, Vorrath's experience and reputation for fixing troubled projects suggest potential for significant improvements in Apple's AI and Siri, which have been lagging behind competitors. This could boost investor confidence in the long term. On the other hand, the article emphasizes the challenges Apple faces, the long timeline for improvements (some initiatives stretching to 2026), and previous AI missteps (inaccurate news recaps). Moreover, numerous previous models indicate a range of opinions averaging approximately 0.57 probability of stock price rise. Taking all these into account, the probability of the stock rising is slightly raised. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing Kim Vorrath to improve its AI and Siri capabilities is a positive development, signaling a renewed focus on addressing known weaknesses.  Vorrath's strong track record in managing complex software projects suggests potential for improvement. However, the news also highlights the significant challenges Apple faces in AI, its current lag behind competitors, the long-term nature of the improvements (with significant upgrades not expected until 2026 at the earliest), and past setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news summaries.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, clustering around a roughly 55-60% probability of a price rise and 40-45% probability of price fall. Considering the mixed signals, the long timeline for significant improvements, and the potential for investor skepticism until tangible results are seen, I've moderated the probability of a stock price rise slightly compared to some of the initial, more optimistic predictions. The overall sentiment is positive but cautious, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the long-term nature of the project and the need for substantial improvements to truly impact the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. appointing Kim Vorrath to improve AI and Siri indicates a strategic move to address long-standing shortcomings in these areas.

Previous predictions ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise, averaging around 0.55-0.6, reflecting balanced optimism tempered by concerns over immediate impact. Recent AI missteps, like inaccurate news recaps, add minor negative sentiment. Overall, the appointment is a positive step but the long-term nature of improvements and existing challenges suggest a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran software executive, to help fix Apple's AI and Siri capabilities indicates a strategic effort to address long-standing shortcomings in these areas.

The mixed signals from the news, including the acknowledgement of past failures and the future improvements planned, contribute to a cautious but overall positive outlook. Given that the previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities for a stock price rise (from 0.55 to 0.7) and fall (from 0.2 to 0.45), I estimate a moderate increase in the probability of a stock price rise, considering Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities and the potential for long-term improvements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran software executive, to help fix AI and Siri at Apple Inc. is a strategic move that indicates the company's commitment to improving its AI capabilities.
