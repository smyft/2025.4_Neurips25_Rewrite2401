      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer as iPhone Sales Slow, China Market Shrinks\nNews Content: Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer reflects concerns over Apple's iPhone sales slowdown and market share decline in China, leading to a negative outlook for the company's long-term growth. The reduction in earnings estimates and revenue forecasts, coupled with the drop in market share, suggests that investor sentiment will likely shift towards caution. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China, is a significant negative signal. The lowered price target and revenue forecast further reinforce this. The 25% drop in iPhone shipments in China for Q4 and a 17% drop for the full year 2024 is alarming, highlighting a loss of market share. While EBITDA margin improvements are a positive factor, they are overshadowed by the overall negative outlook and weak sales numbers, especially predictions around forward predictions. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", coupled with lowered price targets and reduced earnings per share (EPS) estimates, strongly suggests a negative market sentiment towards Apple.  The news highlights significant concerns: slowing iPhone sales, particularly a dramatic 25% drop in Q4 iPhone shipments in China and a shrinking market share there.  Increased competition from local Android manufacturers further exacerbates the situation. While the EBITDA margin increased, this positive factor is overshadowed by the substantial negative impacts of reduced revenue projections and slowing growth. The overall picture painted by the news is one of weakening growth and increased competitive pressure, making a price drop more likely in the short-term. However, Apple remains a large and established company, and the market may react with less volatility than expected, given that some positive aspects (EBITDA increase) are present. Therefore, while a price fall is the more likely scenario, a complete immunity to any price rise is not predicted. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors impacting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform', weaker iPhone sales projections, increased competition in China, and a significant drop in iPhone shipments and market share in China. These factors suggest reduced revenue and earnings expectations, which are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. While the EBITDA margin increased year-on-year, the overall tone of the news is bearish, with analysts warning of challenges in maintaining premium valuation and revenue momentum. Given these points, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and a decline in market share. The firm's price target for Apple was also lowered, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut. These factors generally contribute to a negative outlook for the stock price. Given that the stock already lost 1.5% share value in early trading following the downgrade, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price is likely to continue facing downward pressure. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be low, while the probability of it falling is estimated to be high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China. The firm reduced its price target and revenue forecast, citing a slowdown in iPhone demand and a decline in Apple's market share in China. This negative news suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. However, the article also mentions that the EBITDA margin climbed year over year, which could be a positive factor. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article is bearish, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
