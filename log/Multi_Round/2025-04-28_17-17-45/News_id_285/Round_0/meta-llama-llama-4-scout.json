While the news does not directly mention Apple's (AAPL) specific actions in AI, Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and a leader in technology. The implication is that Apple might also be involved or need to be involved in AI to remain competitive. This could be seen as a neutral to positive signal for Apple's stock, as involvement in AI could potentially lead to new opportunities and reinforce its market position. However, there's no direct information in the headline that specifically highlights Apple's AI moves or financial performance. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, assuming the market interprets this as a positive trend for tech giants like Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"9 of the 10 Largest Companies in the World Are Making Big Moves Into AI.
