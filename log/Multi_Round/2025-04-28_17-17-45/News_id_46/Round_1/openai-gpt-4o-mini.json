(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple (AAPL) Is the Best Stock to Buy in 2025 for Beginners\nNews Content: We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter.

The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a bullish outlook for the stock market in 2025, particularly for large-cap companies like Apple Inc. Given its favorable ranking among stocks for beginners and its robust growth potential in AI services, there is a strong likelihood of price appreciation despite recent struggles in the Chinese market. The overall market forecast from Tom Lee supports a positive sentiment for AAPL. However, potential risks such as government efficiency initiatives and tariffs may impact sentiment. Balancing these factors, it's estimated that the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, it's highlighted as one of the best stocks for beginners in 2025, citing its established brand, large user base, and potential for AI-driven revenue growth. A Fundstrat analyst predicts an overall increase for the S&P 500 which bodes well for mega-cap stocks like Apple. The news also emphasizes mega-cap strength during market uncertainty. On the other hand, the article describes a potential pullback in the second half of 2025, significant shipment decline in China, along with a suggestion that AI stocks may offer better opportunities. Hedge fund positioning in the company, although large, lags AI pure plays. This mixed picture leads to a more balanced assessment. The positive factors slightly outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher rise probability than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it highlights Apple's inclusion in a list of best stocks for beginners and mentions positive aspects like strong services revenue, a large device user base, and potential AI-driven revenue streams, it also acknowledges significant headwinds.  These include a decline in Chinese shipments, the overall cautious market outlook predicted by Tom Lee (which includes a potential second-half pullback),  and the article's own conclusion that other AI stocks offer potentially higher returns in a shorter time frame. The positive aspects are largely based on existing strengths and potential future growth, while the negative aspects are present realities (China sales decline) or potential near future risks (market corrections, government policies).  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, leaning slightly towards a neutral outcome, given the overall uncertain market environment and the article's implicit caution regarding Apple's relative performance among AI stocks. The probability of a fall is considered less likely but still significant given the potential external headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025, citing several factors that could contribute to stock price appreciation. These include: 1) Apple's inclusion in a list of best beginner stocks for 2025, highlighting its stability and growth potential, 2) Strong earnings growth driven by the services segment despite challenges in China, 3) Potential AI-driven revenue growth with upcoming Apple Intelligence features, 4) Positive broader market outlook with S&P 500 expected to rise, and 5) Hedge fund interest (158 holders). However, risks include: 1) Declining shipments in China (17% drop in FY2024), 2) Potential market pullback in second half of 2025 as predicted by Tom Lee, and 3) Some skepticism about overvaluation in tech stocks. On balance, the positive factors outweigh the negatives, especially given Apple's strong position and upcoming AI initiatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as well as the overall stock market for 2025. Tom Lee's optimistic yet cautious forecast for the S&P 500, and the mention of mega-cap companies like Apple leading the market, contribute to a favorable view of AAPL. Additionally, the article highlights Apple's strong performance in services, its expansive platform for AI services, and a forecasted 6% growth rate for 2025. However, it also mentions potential risks and challenges faced by the company, such as declining shipments in China. Despite these challenges, the overall tone and specific positive mentions about Apple's prospects suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents an overall positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025, citing its position as one of the best stocks to buy for beginners. Despite some turbulence in China, the company is experiencing earnings growth, primarily due to its services segment. Additionally, the article highlights the potential for Apple's AI services and features, which could translate to further revenue potential. However, the article also notes that Tom Lee's 2025 playbook presents a cautious outlook for the stock market, with an expected increase of about 8% for the year, and potential risks such as reduced government spending and tariffs. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, but not excessively high due to the cautious market outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) positive outlook with an expected increase in the stock market for 2025. Despite concerns regarding market turbulence and risks in China, Apple shows resilience with growth in services and potential revenue from AI services. The positive market sentiment and the prominent position in the list of best stocks for beginners suggest a high probability of stock price rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
