(AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc.'s Q4 2024 revenue growth of 6% driven by new product launches and AI integration suggests strong performance, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the broader context of hedge funds reducing positions in technology stocks due to concerns about competition and regulatory issues creates uncertainty. Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish outlook on AI, indicating potential for future growth, but the caution from hedge funds may pressure stock prices. Overall, there is a moderate expectation for stock price rise due to the reported growth, offset by market caution and external competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, the company reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system, has been well-received, potentially boosting user engagement and satisfaction. Goldman Sachs is broadly bullish on AI and sees Apple as an AI superstar. However, some factors temper the bullish outlook. Hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks, including those benefiting from AI, indicating a cautious sentiment. Concerns about international competition, particularly from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek, and regulatory complexities surrounding large AI projects, contribute to market uncertainty and volatility. Several articles indicate there are stocks that may be more promising for investment. On balance the news is good, especially because of the revenue growth of 6%. Taking all the factors into account, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While Apple reported positive 6% revenue growth driven by new products and AI integration, the broader context of the article focuses on a cautious outlook for US tech stocks due to several factors:  Hedge funds are reducing their tech holdings, concerns exist about competition from Chinese AI companies (DeepSeek), and regulatory uncertainty surrounding major AI projects are causing market volatility.  Although Apple is highlighted as an AI superstar by Goldman Sachs and shows positive revenue growth, the overall bearish sentiment towards the tech sector and the possibility of reduced hedge fund investment outweighs the positive news of Apple's Q4 performance in terms of predicting short-term price movement.  The fact that the article itself downplays Apple relative to other, potentially cheaper, AI stocks further suggests limited upside potential in the immediate future.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive indicator for the stock. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and its positive reception could further boost investor confidence. However, the article also mentions broader market concerns, such as hedge funds reducing positions in tech stocks due to competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek and regulatory uncertainties. While Apple's strong financials and AI advancements are bullish signals, the overall cautious sentiment in the tech sector and hedge fund behavior introduce some downside risk. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news headline reports a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 for Apple Inc., driven by new product launches and AI integration. Although the tech sector has experienced a recent selloff, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures, citing strong financials and the potential for new competitors to emerge. Hedge funds have reduced their positions in technology stocks, but a smaller group has maintained long positions, indicating confidence in future AI-driven growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive revenue growth for Apple Inc. driven by new product launches and AI integration. However, the overall tech sector faces challenges due to increased competition, particularly from Chinese startups, and regulatory uncertainties. On one hand, the revenue growth and product launches suggest positive market reaction. On the other hand, the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector could offset these positives.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Despite Apple's reported 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 driven by new product launches and AI integration, there is a broader cautious sentiment across the tech sector, mainly due to hedge funds reducing their positions in technology stocks and concerns over competition from international players like DeepSeek. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the long-term prospects of AI, and a smaller group of hedge funds maintains long positions in tech, indicating some confidence in future growth. However, regulatory uncertainties and growing competition weigh on the stock's outlook. Overall, while the news is positive, the surrounding market conditions suggest a moderate probability of price increase but also significant risks, leading to a balanced perspective on movement probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The consistency in revenue growth (6%) is a positive indicator. However, the cautionary stance from hedge funds, as highlighted in multiple rounds, remains a significant factor. The presence of international competition (DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainties create ongoing market volatility. Given the slight dip in many of others' sentiment regarding the rising probability, I will also lower my expectation a little bit.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's 6% revenue growth is positive, driven by new products and AI integration.  However, the broader market context is crucial. Hedge funds' reduced tech positions signal caution, fueled by Chinese competition (DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty.  Goldman Sachs' bullish AI outlook is encouraging, but the immediate market sentiment seems more cautious. While Apple's performance is strong, the overall bearish tech sentiment and potential for continued market volatility outweigh the positive news in the short term.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but a slight majority lean towards a rise, though not strongly.  Considering the mixed signals, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it is near the 50/50 mark reflecting the market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive signal for investors. The successful integration of Apple Intelligence and its features like writing refinement and a more capable Siri could enhance user engagement and satisfaction, further supporting growth. However, the broader context includes hedge funds reducing their positions in technology stocks due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek and regulatory uncertainties. While Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish outlook on AI and Apple's strong financials, the cautious sentiment from hedge funds introduces some downside risk. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news reports a 6% revenue growth for Apple Inc. in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This positive growth, along with the introduction of Apple Intelligence and its positive reception, suggests a bullish signal for the stock. However, broader market concerns such as hedge funds reducing positions in tech stocks due to competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek and regulatory uncertainties introduce some downside risk. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news reports a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 for Apple Inc., driven by new product launches and AI integration. This growth suggests a positive performance for the company. However, the broader tech sector faces challenges, including competition from Chinese startups and regulatory uncertainties, which could negatively impact the stock price. Considering these factors, I analyzed the predictions from other models, which showed mixed sentiments. Some models had a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the revenue growth, while others had a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the broader negative sentiment in the tech sector. After weighing these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive signal. Apple's integration of AI into its products, particularly the introduction of Apple Intelligence, has bolstered user engagement and satisfaction. However, the broader market context includes caution from hedge funds due to international competition and regulatory uncertainties. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic. Previous predictions also show a mixed view with slight advantages towards a rise in stock price, albeit with considerable caution.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, positively influenced by new product launches and the integration of AI technology, which suggests strong performance trends. However, there is a broader caution in the tech sector, influenced by hedge funds reducing their positions due to emerging competition from international players like the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek and regulatory uncertainties. Despite this cautious sentiment, Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish outlook on AI, indicating potential for long-term growth. This mixed outlook leads to a slight bias in favor of price increase, but significant downside risks exist, creating a moderate probability for stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The consistent 6% revenue growth driven by new products and AI is a significant positive. Apple Intelligence adoption is also a bullish factor. However, the persistent concern around hedge fund activity (reducing positions due to competition and regulatory uncertainty) remains a substantial headwind. The presence of DeepSeek adds to competitive pressures. While Goldman Sachs remains bullish in the long term, short-term market sentiment appears more cautious, and several predictions are indicating the probability of stock price rising is decreasing. Based on this combination of factors, I am moderately lowering my prediction of a rise compared to previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: Apple's 6% revenue growth is positive, demonstrating strong performance driven by new products and AI integration.  The successful launch of the iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4, coupled with the positive reception of Apple Intelligence, suggests continued market strength and potential for future growth.  However, several factors temper this optimism.  The broader tech sector is experiencing caution from hedge funds, who are reducing their positions due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups (DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty. This overall market sentiment introduces significant downside risk.  While Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI in the long term, the immediate market reaction may be influenced more heavily by the short-term concerns of hedge funds.  Considering the mixed signals \u2013 strong company performance countered by broader market uncertainty \u2013 a probability slightly favoring a price rise is assigned, reflecting the balance between positive internal company performance and negative external market forces. The previous predictions show a converging trend toward a roughly 50/50 probability, and that influences my final prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company reported a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024, driven by new product launches and AI integration, including the well-received Apple Intelligence system. This suggests strong performance and potential for future growth. However, the broader context includes hedge funds reducing their positions in technology stocks due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek and regulatory uncertainties. While Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI and Apple's strong financials, the cautious sentiment from hedge funds introduces some downside risk. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the overall market conditions suggest significant risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The financial news reports a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 for Apple Inc., driven by new product launches and AI integration.

Considering these factors and analyzing the predictions from other models, which showed mixed sentiments, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. The company's strong financials, successful integration of AI, and bullish outlook from Goldman Sachs contribute to the positive outlook, while caution from hedge funds and market volatility introduce downside risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 driven by new product launches and AI integration, which is a positive signal.
