(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights two downgrades on Apple stock due to weak iPhone sales and a pessimistic outlook on AI advancements. Analysts expect lower-than-expected revenue, particularly in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. The downgrades, coupled with declining iPhone market share and reduced sales forecasts, create a negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Given the decline in share price and the pressures highlighted, the likelihood of a stock price fall is higher than that of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), declining market share, and a lack of investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives, all point towards potential downward pressure on the stock price. The specific mentions of reduced revenue forecasts and the underperformance of Apple's stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further solidify this bearish outlook. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential positive catalysts, they are presented as possibilities rather than certainties and are unlikely to immediately offset the current negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% on the news emphasizes the market's concern. Earnings are slated to be released soon, which could provide additional insight into the actual performance of the company in the last quarter. However, the current projections, given the analyst downgrades, suggest disappointing results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news contains multiple negative factors impacting Apple's stock price.  Two downgrades from reputable analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital) signal a bearish outlook.  The primary concern is weak iPhone sales, particularly a significant year-over-year decline in China (15-20%), a major market for Apple.  Furthermore, the anticipated boost from Apple Intelligence (AI platform) seems to be underperforming expectations, adding another layer of concern. While Apple is launching new products, these may not be sufficient to offset the substantial decline in iPhone sales and the overall negative sentiment. The fact that Apple's stock price already fell 3.7% on the news further suggests the market's negative reaction.  However, the probability of a fall isn't 100% because Apple still has strong fundamentals in other areas and the market may not fully reflect the projected decline in Q1 iPhone sales, or the new product launches may prove more impactful than anticipated. The probability of a rise is still relatively low given the overwhelming negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from two analysts due to weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lackluster AI outlook. Apple's iPhone sales in China fell by 15-20% YoY, and overall iPhone market share declined by 1% in Q4. Additionally, the AI push has not met investor expectations, with Apple Intelligence failing to drive a sales supercycle. Given these headwinds, the stock has already reacted negatively, falling 3.7% on the news. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 may further reflect these challenges, though new product launches (iPhone SE, iPads, MacBook Airs) could provide some support. Overall, the negative sentiment and downward revisions in price targets suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital due to weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers. Jefferies downgraded its rating to Underperform with a reduced price target of $200.75, while Loop Capital downgraded its rating to Hold with a revised price target of $230. The news also mentions that iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year, and overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%. Additionally, Jefferies forecasts a decline in iPhone revenue by 0.4% year over year for the first quarter. These negative factors are likely to impact the stock price negatively. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook' suggests that Apple's stock price is likely to be negatively affected by the downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, as well as the weak iPhone sales and lack of interest in AI among consumers. The downgrades and weak sales data indicate a potential decline in Apple's revenue, which could lead to a decrease in the stock price. Additionally, the fact that Apple's competitors, such as Meta and Alphabet, have seen significant gains in the past year, while Apple's stock has only risen 16%, further supports the idea that Apple's stock price may fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and lowered price targets for Apple Inc., citing concerns over weak iPhone sales and lack of AI interest. Both Jefferies and Loop Capital have made bearish adjustments, indicating a potential decline in stock performance. Additionally, there is a mention of recent stock price movements reflecting these concerns. This negative sentiment is likely to negatively impact investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
