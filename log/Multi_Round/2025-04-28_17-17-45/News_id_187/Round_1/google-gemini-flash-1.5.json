(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos\nNews Content: DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Salesforce's competition with Microsoft and highlights Salesforce's recent success with their AI offerings. While the bullish sentiment around AI could positively influence tech stocks overall, the commentary does not relate directly to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, Guggenheim's downgrade of Salesforce introduces some skepticism into the narrative. Since this news is not directly impactful to AAPL and reflects a competitive landscape, it leads to an estimated probability of a neutral or slightly negative effect, increasing the chances of a stock price fall due to market reaction to Microsoft and Salesforce's competitive dynamics. Thus, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price going down in response to the news, but not significantly. The tech market sentiment around AI remains a pivotal aspect that could support a price increase in the long run.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news primarily focuses on the competitive rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft regarding AI, specifically their AI agent offerings (Agentforce and Copilot respectively). While the article mentions opinions about Microsoft's Copilot and aggressive sales tactics by Salesforce, the central theme is competition. The specific negative commentary is directed towards Salesforce's primary competitor, Microsoft. While negative sentiment surrounding competitors *can* sometimes impact related tech stocks, it generally impacts the involved companies directly. The mention of Salesforce closing 2,000 AI deals in Q3 is a positive signal. However, the downgrade by a Guggenheim analyst raises concerns about Salesforce's ability to monetize Agentforce effectively and highlights the importance of dynamic vs static AI solutions. All considered, while the market may find the comments intriguing or even amusing, the news doesn't specifically target Apple's business model directly. Furthermore, Apple's stock is robust, with an extremely high market cap, such that such news is unlikely to be highly impactful in itself.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding AI capabilities. While Salesforce's CEO is bullish on their AI offerings and cites strong initial adoption, the article also highlights skepticism from at least one analyst who doubts the long-term monetization potential of Salesforce's Agentforce.  The headline and content are about Salesforce, not Apple. Therefore, the news is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price.  Any impact on AAPL would be indirect and likely minimal, possibly stemming from broader market movements influenced by the performance of tech giants or investor sentiment toward the AI sector. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities are heavily weighted toward no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the content does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news discusses a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI sector, with Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff criticizing Microsoft's AI offerings. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news is focused on the competition between Salesforce and Microsoft, and does not provide any direct information about Apple, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The neutral impact suggests a slight inclination towards a hold or stable position rather than a significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft regarding their AI business tools. While the criticism from Benioff might have a negative impact on Microsoft's stock, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions Apple Inc. only as a platform where a podcast discussing the topic is available, implying no significant connection to the conflict or the companies involved. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price being affected by this news is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft, specifically criticizing Microsoft's AI tools. While this could be seen as negative for Microsoft, it might indirectly benefit Salesforce competitors like Apple by shifting competitive focus away from Apple's own AI initiatives. However, the news directly impacts Salesforce rather than Apple. Given Salesforce's recent stock performance driven by optimism around AI solutions and a minority bearish stance, it is critical to note that the news does not directly relate to Apple\u2019s financials or operational strategies.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
