(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos\nNews Content: DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Salesforce's competition with Microsoft and highlights Salesforce's recent success with their AI offerings. While the bullish sentiment around AI could positively influence tech stocks overall, the commentary does not relate directly to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, Guggenheim's downgrade of Salesforce introduces some skepticism into the narrative. Since this news is not directly impactful to AAPL and reflects a competitive landscape, it leads to an estimated probability of a neutral or slightly negative effect, increasing the chances of a stock price fall due to market reaction to Microsoft and Salesforce's competitive dynamics. Thus, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price going down in response to the news, but not significantly. The tech market sentiment around AI remains a pivotal aspect that could support a price increase in the long run.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news primarily focuses on the competitive rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft regarding AI, specifically their AI agent offerings (Agentforce and Copilot respectively). While the article mentions opinions about Microsoft's Copilot and aggressive sales tactics by Salesforce, the central theme is competition. The specific negative commentary is directed towards Salesforce's primary competitor, Microsoft. While negative sentiment surrounding competitors *can* sometimes impact related tech stocks, it generally impacts the involved companies directly. The mention of Salesforce closing 2,000 AI deals in Q3 is a positive signal. However, the downgrade by a Guggenheim analyst raises concerns about Salesforce's ability to monetize Agentforce effectively and highlights the importance of dynamic vs static AI solutions. All considered, while the market may find the comments intriguing or even amusing, the news doesn't specifically target Apple's business model directly. Furthermore, Apple's stock is robust, with an extremely high market cap, such that such news is unlikely to be highly impactful in itself.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding AI capabilities. While Salesforce's CEO is bullish on their AI offerings and cites strong initial adoption, the article also highlights skepticism from at least one analyst who doubts the long-term monetization potential of Salesforce's Agentforce.  The headline and content are about Salesforce, not Apple. Therefore, the news is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price.  Any impact on AAPL would be indirect and likely minimal, possibly stemming from broader market movements influenced by the performance of tech giants or investor sentiment toward the AI sector. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities are heavily weighted toward no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the content does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news discusses a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI sector, with Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff criticizing Microsoft's AI offerings. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news is focused on the competition between Salesforce and Microsoft, and does not provide any direct information about Apple, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The neutral impact suggests a slight inclination towards a hold or stable position rather than a significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft regarding their AI business tools. While the criticism from Benioff might have a negative impact on Microsoft's stock, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions Apple Inc. only as a platform where a podcast discussing the topic is available, implying no significant connection to the conflict or the companies involved. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price being affected by this news is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft, specifically criticizing Microsoft's AI tools. While this could be seen as negative for Microsoft, it might indirectly benefit Salesforce competitors like Apple by shifting competitive focus away from Apple's own AI initiatives. However, the news directly impacts Salesforce rather than Apple. Given Salesforce's recent stock performance driven by optimism around AI solutions and a minority bearish stance, it is critical to note that the news does not directly relate to Apple\u2019s financials or operational strategies.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses a rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft, focusing on AI capabilities. While Salesforce has experienced a surge in its stock due to optimism around AI, the ongoing competition and skepticism from analysts introduce a mixed sentiment. Since the article does not directly relate to Apple and primarily highlights a competing tech environment, any impact on AAPL is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the estimate reflects a balanced view with a slight inclination towards price stability rather than significant movement, resulting in a moderate probability of a rise and a slight probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on the competition between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI space. There's no direct mention of Apple (AAPL) or any indication how this rivalry might affect Apple's business. Previous rounds of prediction mostly resulted in either very low probabilities of stock movement or probabilities hovering around 0.4-0.45 in either direction, reflecting overall uncertainty and a recognition that the primary focus of the news is elsewhere. I'll maintain this interpretation, expecting minimal impact specifically as this involves Salesforce and Microsoft specifically. The generally tech stock performance is highly complex and has many factors outside of this current headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft, specifically their AI offerings.  While the bullish sentiment surrounding Salesforce's AI might indirectly impact the broader tech sector, there is no direct relevance to Apple.  The article doesn't mention Apple's products, strategies, or financial performance.  Previous predictions consistently show a consensus toward minimal impact on Apple's stock price.  The Guggenheim analyst downgrade of Salesforce, while potentially affecting the overall tech sector sentiment to some degree, is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of any significant price movement for Apple is low, leaning slightly towards no change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on the competitive dynamics between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding their AI offerings, with no direct mention or impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. The minor probabilities of price movement stem from broader market sentiment around AI and tech stocks, but these are expected to be minimal due to the lack of direct relevance to Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding AI capabilities, with no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The content does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The various predictions from previous models reflect a consensus that the news is not directly relevant to Apple, leading to a neutral impact assessment. Given this, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft regarding their AI products, with no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The competition between these two companies is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which range from assigning low probabilities to neutral outcomes, the most reasonable approach is to estimate a minimal impact on Apple's stock price. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising or falling should be close to equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance of the news to Apple's business or financials.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses a competitive rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI sector. Although Salesforce's CEO criticizes Microsoft, the news does not directly address Apple Inc. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. The news might indirectly influence market sentiments or shifts in focus among competitors, which could potentially have a slight effect on Apple's stock. However, considering the overall robustness of Apple's business, any impact is likely to be negligible.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the competitive dynamics between Salesforce and Microsoft, specifically their AI offerings, and does not have a direct connection to Apple Inc. The sentiment around AI may positively influence tech stocks in general, but the content does not relate specifically to Apple's business operations or market position. Most analysis indicates minimal impact on AAPL, with probabilities leaning towards stability given the lack of relevant information. Therefore, while there is some uncertainty in the market, any possible movements for AAPL are likely to be small and neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news focuses on the competition between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI space. Apple is not directly mentioned, and the previous rounds of predictions largely converge on the idea that this news has little to no direct impact on Apple's stock. While broader market sentiment around AI could have some indirect effects, Apple's business is robust enough that any influence is likely to be minimal. Furthermore, the trend in predictions is converging to an assignment of diminishing probabilities of significant movement. Given the lack of direct relevance and the trend indicated in historical responses, I will maintain the position that the movement caused by the news will be negligible.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the competitive battle between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI space.  Apple is not directly mentioned, and the news lacks any direct relevance to Apple's business, financials, or operations. While broader market sentiment toward the tech sector or AI could indirectly influence Apple's stock price, the probability of a significant impact due to this specific news is extremely low.  The consensus among previous models supports this assessment of minimal influence.  The slight variations in previous predictions likely reflect the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news item. Because of the lack of direct connection, the likelihood of a price rise or fall is approximately equal and close to zero, indicating market neutrality toward this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on the competitive dynamics between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding their AI offerings, with no direct mention or impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. The minor probabilities of price movement stem from broader market sentiment around AI and tech stocks, but these are expected to be minimal due to the lack of direct relevance to Apple. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a consensus that the news is not directly relevant to Apple, leading to a neutral impact assessment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) regarding their AI offerings, with no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The competition between these two companies is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The consensus from previous predictions reflects a minimal impact on Apple's stock price, leading to a neutral assessment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news primarily focuses on the competitive rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI sector, with no direct mention or impact on Apple Inc.

The various predictions from previous models reflect a consensus that the news is not directly relevant to Apple, leading to a neutral impact assessment. Considering the lack of direct relevance and the robustness of Apple's business, any impact on the stock price is expected to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses a competitive rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI sector. Although Salesforce's CEO criticizes Microsoft, the news does not directly address Apple Inc. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. The news might indirectly influence market sentiments or shifts in focus among competitors, which could potentially have a slight effect on Apple's stock. However, considering the overall robustness of Apple's business, any impact is likely to be negligible. Previous predictions across multiple models already reflected a consensus that the news is not directly relevant to Apple.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news focuses on the rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft regarding AI capabilities, with no direct connection to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The commentary and competitive dynamics are largely centered around Salesforce's success and criticisms of Microsoft, which do not directly impact Apple\u2019s core business operations or market position. While there may be secondary effects on overall tech market sentiment, the predictions consistently indicate a minimal impact on AAPL's stock price. Given that earlier predictions trend towards stability with little movement expected, the probabilities reflect a balanced outlook between rise and fall but lean towards minimal changes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article details a conflict between Salesforce and Microsoft regarding AI. It does not directly involve or mention Apple. Prior predictions consistently indicated a negligible impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of any significant stock price movement for Apple is minimal. Market sentiment is unlikely to shift based solely on this news, given Apple's robust financial standing and lack of direct involvement. The prevailing consensus of previous models reinforces the assessment of no direct impact. Therefore, any slight rise or fall is considered speculative and unlikely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the competitive rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft in the AI sector.  There is no direct mention of Apple, and the information provided is not directly relevant to Apple's business, financials, or future prospects.  While broader market sentiment regarding AI or the tech sector in general *could* indirectly influence Apple's stock price, the probability of a significant movement based solely on this news is extremely low. The consensus among previous predictions consistently points towards minimal impact on Apple's stock price.  The overwhelmingly low probability of a stock price rise or fall across multiple models and rounds of predictions strongly suggests that this news is largely irrelevant to AAPL's short-term valuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a competitive rivalry between Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI sector, with no direct mention or impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. The consensus from previous predictions across multiple models reflects a minimal impact on Apple's stock price, leading to a neutral assessment. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

(AAPL). The article does not pertain to Apple's business, products, or market position.
