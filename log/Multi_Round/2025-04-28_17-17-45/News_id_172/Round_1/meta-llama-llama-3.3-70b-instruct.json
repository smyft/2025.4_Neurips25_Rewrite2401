(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Epic Games intensifying its competition with Apple due to app store fees and the introduction of third-party games in its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially raise concerns about market share and revenue impacts for Apple, the federal court's previous rulings mostly favor Apple, and the company continues to have a strong ecosystem for app distribution. Therefore, any short-term stock price volatility is likely to be limited, with a higher chance that the stock remains stable or rises due to its established market position. However, there is a risk of downward pressure if investors react negatively to the competitive landscape and potential regulatory implications.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: This news article highlights Epic Games' continued efforts to challenge Apple and Google's app store dominance. While Epic is investing heavily in its platform, it faces significant hurdles, including developer hesitation due to Apple's Core Technology Fee and past legal setbacks. The article notes previous court result where the scales tipped in favor of Apple. The article highlights Epic spending more than it is making to try and 'invest in growth'. Considering this dynamic and Apple's historical ability to defend its ecosystem, the probable impact is slightly negative upon initial reaction. However, long-term implications are hard to discern.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' escalating conflict with Apple over app store fees and the expansion of Epic's own mobile marketplace. While Epic's actions could potentially pressure Apple to change its policies, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term. The article highlights that Apple won a significant portion of its legal battle against Epic in 2023.  Even though Epic is adding third-party games to its store and investing heavily, the success of this endeavor remains uncertain and is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's enormous and diversified revenue streams in the near future.  The long-term implications might be more substantial, but the news doesn't offer a clear indication of an immediate effect.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted toward little to no change in Apple's stock price. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing legal and market battle with Apple over app-store fees and restrictions, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue from its App Store. The article mentions that Apple and Google collected $23 billion in 2023 from app store fees, indicating significant revenue reliance on this segment. However, the impact of Epic Games' actions is likely limited in the short term, as none of the top 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers have joined Epic's store yet. Additionally, Apple has already faced legal setbacks (e.g., being asked to open up to outside payment options) and has measures like the Core Technology Fee to mitigate losses. Given Apple's diversified business and strong financial position, the immediate impact on its stock price is likely muted. The market may view this as a continuation of existing challenges rather than a new threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' efforts to challenge Apple's and Google's dominance in the mobile app store market by adding third-party game titles to its Epic Games Store. This move is part of a long-standing dispute over app store fees and restrictions. While Epic Games' actions may pose a threat to Apple's App Store business model, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Apple's App Store still holds a strong position, and the company has already made some concessions, such as allowing outside payment options. The news may lead to short-term volatility but is unlikely to cause a significant long-term decline in Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' expansion of its mobile marketplace to include third-party game titles, which is a direct challenge to Apple's and Google's app store dominance. This move is part of Epic Games' ongoing dispute with these tech giants over their app store fees. While Epic Games' actions may put pressure on Apple and Google to reconsider their fees, it is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. However, if Epic Games' efforts are successful in the long run, it could potentially lead to a decrease in Apple's revenue from app store fees. Given the current market dynamics and the fact that Apple has a diverse range of revenue streams, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market dispute between Apple and Epic Games regarding app-store fees. This ongoing issue may lead to a decline in user experience for users trying to access Epic Game's titles through Apple devices, potentially impacting Apple's revenue from app store. However, the news doesn't directly impact the immediate performance metrics of Apple Inc but reflects a longer-term strategic and regulatory battle.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
