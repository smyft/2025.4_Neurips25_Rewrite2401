The headline is also somewhat clickbait-y. Therefore, while the headline is positive, its direct impact on immediate stock price movement is likely moderate. A slight bias towards an increase is probable due to the positive sentiment, but immediate and drastic movements are less likely due to the backward looking nature of the article.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Could Buying Apple Stock Today Set You Up for Life?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
