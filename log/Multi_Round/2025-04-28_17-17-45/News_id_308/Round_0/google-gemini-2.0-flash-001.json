It doesn't specify which \\\"glass stocks\\\" Apple is investing in, the size of the investment, or the rationale behind it. Without more specific information, it's impossible to assess the potential impact on Apple's stock price. The market's reaction could depend on whether investors view the investment as strategic, innovative, or financially risky. Due to the ambiguity and lack of substance in the news, I'm assigning a relatively equal probability to a rise or fall, but factoring in the possibility of 'no change' by slightly reducing both rise and fall probabilities.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Glass Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.40,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.40\n}\n```"
