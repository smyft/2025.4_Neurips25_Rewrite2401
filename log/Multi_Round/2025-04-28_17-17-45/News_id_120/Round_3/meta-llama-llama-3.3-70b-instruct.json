(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news surrounding Berkshire Hathaway's performance is closely linked to Apple's upcoming quarterly report. Given that Berkshire's stake in Apple is substantial, investors in Berkshire may react to Apple's results. However, historical data shows that while Apple has had significant positive earnings surprises, the immediate impact on Berkshire's stock price has been minimal, with less than a 2% rise historically. Current commentary also indicates that Berkshire's valuation is considered less attractive by investors, which may limit positive movements. Therefore, the probability of an increase in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price due to Apple's earnings report is relatively low, while the chance of a drop due to overall market sentiment and valuation concerns is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article focuses on whether to buy Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) stock before Apple's (AAPL) earnings report. It notes that while Apple constitutes a significant portion of Berkshire's portfolio, the correlation between the two stocks is moderate. Historical examples suggest Apple's strong earnings don't necessarily translate to a proportional jump in Berkshire's stock price. The author also points out that Berkshire itself might be overvalued, as the company hasn't been buying back its own shares recently and analyst growth estimates are modest. The article overall has a neutral to slightly negative tone regarding Berkshire's immediate prospects. Therefore, there may not be any affect from Apple earnings and is likely no material movement on the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Berkshire Hathaway's potential reaction to Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While Apple's performance significantly impacts Berkshire (due to Berkshire's substantial Apple holding), the historical correlation between the two stocks' movements is only moderate (0.49). Past instances show Apple's strong earnings reports leading to a proportionally smaller increase in Berkshire's stock price.  The article also highlights concerns about Berkshire Hathaway itself, including a lack of recent stock buybacks and a relatively high P/E ratio, suggesting that even positive Apple news might not significantly boost Berkshire's price. Therefore, the impact of Apple's earnings on AAPL's stock price is considered separately. The probability of AAPL's stock price rising or falling is assessed based on general market expectations around Apple's performance and the inherent volatility of the tech sector.  Given the importance of the AI integration into new iPhones and the general market anticipation around Apple earnings, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, even without explicit mention in this news piece which focuses on Berkshire Hathaway. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historically, there has been a moderate correlation (0.49) between the stock performances of Apple and Berkshire Hathaway. However, past instances show that even when Apple reports strong results, Berkshire's stock price increase is relatively muted (less than 1% to 1.7%). The article also highlights that Berkshire's current valuation is not particularly attractive, with no recent stock buybacks and modest growth projections. Given these factors, the direct impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire's stock price is likely to be limited. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Berkshire's stock price due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, it notes that historically, Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not considered attractive by its own historical standards, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. Furthermore, Warren Buffett's recent decision not to repurchase Berkshire shares suggests that he may not view the current valuation as compelling. Based on this analysis, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising appears to be low, as the article concludes that there's no strong reason to invest in Berkshire ahead of Apple's results on Jan 30.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Although Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, historical data shows that Apple's stock performance has a moderate correlation with Berkshire Hathaway's stock performance. Additionally, past instances of Apple's strong quarterly reports have not led to significant increases in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. The article concludes that there is no compelling reason to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock solely based on Apple's upcoming earnings report. However, the article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway is a good long-term investment due to its reliable cash flow, diversification, and massive cash stockpile. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to this news is lower than the probability of it falling, as the article presents a cautious outlook on the stock's short-term performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics. While it mentions Apple's earnings report on Jan. 30, which may have an indirect effect on Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article concludes that rushed investments in Berkshire Hathaway should not be encouraged based on Apple's report. The article suggests Berkshire's current valuation and analyst expectations do not justify immediate action.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates limited potential for Berkshire Hathaway's stock price to rise significantly due to Apple's upcoming earnings report. Historical patterns show a moderate correlation between the stock performances of Apple and Berkshire Hathaway, but past strong results from Apple have not resulted in proportional movements in Berkshire's stock price. Additionally, concerns about Berkshire's valuation and lack of recent buybacks suggest a cautious outlook. Therefore, while there is some probability of a rise in stock price based on general market sentiments, it is outweighed by the probability of a fall given the current valuation concerns and lack of compelling reasons to invest immediately.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the relationship between Apple's earnings and Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. While a significant portion of Berkshire's portfolio is in Apple, historical data suggests only a moderate correlation. Previous instances show that even when Apple performs exceptionally well, Berkshire's stock doesn't necessarily see a proportional jump. Furthermore, the current commentary indicates that Berkshire might be overvalued, with factors such as a lack of recent stock buybacks and modest analyst growth estimates. The previous round's predictions leaned slightly towards a falling price. Considering all factors, there's more downside risk than upside potential.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), not Apple (AAPL). While Apple's earnings announcement is mentioned as potentially indirectly impacting Berkshire due to Berkshire's large Apple holdings, the article's overall tone is neutral to slightly negative regarding Berkshire's short-term prospects.  Past instances show a weak correlation between strong Apple earnings and significant Berkshire stock price movements.  Further, Berkshire's own valuation concerns and lack of recent buybacks suggest limited upside potential, even with positive Apple news.  The previous predictions range widely, highlighting the uncertainty.  Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple's stock and the prevailing negative sentiment around Berkshire's valuation, I predict a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall for AAPL than a rise, acknowledging the inherent volatility of tech stocks and the potential positive impact of strong Apple earnings generally.  The probability assessment is made primarily based on the analysis of Berkshire Hathaway and its limited expected response to Apple's earnings, as well as the inherent volatility of the Apple stock itself, and is not directly based on the provided news predicting a rise or fall in Apple stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant stake in Apple. However, historical data shows that Apple's strong earnings reports have only led to modest increases in Berkshire's stock price (less than 2%). The article also highlights concerns about Berkshire's current valuation, including a high forward P/E ratio and lack of recent stock buybacks, suggesting limited upside potential. While the article maintains a neutral to slightly negative tone on Berkshire's short-term prospects, it does not indicate any immediate negative catalyst from Apple's earnings. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of a rise given the focus on Apple's AI features and their potential impact on iPhone sales.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given that Apple is a significant holding in Berkshire's portfolio. However, historical data shows that Berkshire's stock price has not reacted strongly to Apple's performance. The article also mentions that Berkshire's current valuation is not considered attractive by its own historical standards, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. Furthermore, Warren Buffett's recent decision not to repurchase Berkshire shares suggests that he may not view the current valuation as compelling. Based on this analysis, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising appears to be low, as the article concludes that there's no strong reason to invest in Berkshire ahead of Apple's results on Jan 30.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. However, historical data shows a moderate correlation between Apple and Berkshire Hathaway's stock performances, and past instances of Apple's strong reports have not led to significant increases in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights concerns about Berkshire Hathaway's current valuation and Warren Buffett's recent decision not to repurchase shares, suggesting a cautious outlook. Considering these factors and the predictions from other models, which generally indicate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher or similar probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probabilities of stock price movement for Berkshire Hathaway.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics. While it mentions Apple's earnings report on Jan. 30, which may have an indirect effect on Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, historical data and expert opinions suggest the reaction might be limited. The article concludes that there is no strong reason to buy Berkshire solely based on Apple's results. Moreover, Berkshire's valuation and recent actions, such as not repurchasing shares, indicate potential skepticism among investors. Hence, while there might be some positive sentiment due to Apple's earnings, the probability of Berkshire's stock price rising significantly is relatively low.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights the impact of Apple's upcoming earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway, noting that while Apple holds significant weight in Berkshire's portfolio, the historical correlation between their stock performances is moderate (0.49). Previous strong earnings reports from Apple led to minimal impacts on Berkshire's stock price, with increases generally below 2%. Given concerns about Berkshire's current valuation and the lack of stock buybacks, the outlook for Berkshire is cautious. Therefore, while there may be some positive sentiment from Apple's report, the probability of a significant rise in Berkshire's stock price appears limited, leading to a higher probability of a fall due to overall market sentiment and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the relationship between Apple's earnings report and Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. While Apple is a significant holding for Berkshire, historical data suggests a limited correlation, and past strong Apple earnings haven't led to proportional jumps in Berkshire's stock. Concerns about Berkshire's valuation, indicated by the lack of stock buybacks and modest growth estimates, further limit potential upside. Previous rounds of predictions lean towards a slightly negative outlook. Considering the neutral to slightly negative tone of the article and the historical lack of strong correlation, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and its potential reaction to Apple's (AAPL) upcoming earnings report.  While Apple is a significant holding for Berkshire, the historical correlation between their stock price movements is moderate, and past instances show limited impact on BRK even with strong AAPL performance.  The article highlights concerns about Berkshire's valuation and lack of recent stock buybacks, painting a neutral to slightly negative outlook for BRK.  Therefore, the analysis focuses on Berkshire's stock price reaction to the news and not directly on Apple's stock price movement.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities but lean towards a higher chance for BRK to fall rather than rise, and the lack of concrete reasons for BRK to significantly move based on AAPL's earnings, the most likely outcome is minimal change.  The probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of slight downward pressure from the current valuation concerns, rather than significant upward movement from AAPL's earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway's potential reaction to Apple's upcoming earnings report, given Berkshire's significant stake in Apple. Historical data indicates a moderate correlation (0.49) between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances, but past instances of strong Apple earnings have led to only modest increases in Berkshire's stock price (less than 2%). The article also highlights concerns about Berkshire's current valuation, including a high forward P/E ratio and lack of recent stock buybacks, suggesting limited upside potential. Overall, the article maintains a neutral to slightly negative tone on Berkshire's short-term prospects, with no strong reason to expect a significant rise due to Apple's earnings. Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising is relatively low, while the probability of a fall is higher due to valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its potential reaction to Apple's upcoming earnings report. Historical data shows a moderate correlation between Apple and Berkshire Hathaway's stock performances, but past instances of Apple's strong reports have not led to significant increases in Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Additionally, concerns about Berkshire Hathaway's current valuation, including a high forward P/E ratio of 23.6 and lack of recent stock buybacks, suggest limited upside potential. The consensus among various predictions is that the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising is relatively low, while the probability of a fall is higher due to valuation concerns and modest growth expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant stake in Apple.
