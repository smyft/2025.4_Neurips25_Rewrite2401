      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: What Analysts Expect from Apple's Q1 2025 Earnings Report\nNews Content: The release of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) Fiscal First Quarter 2025 results is anticipated to draw market players' attention, with the global market conditions taking a toll on the sector. Apple is expected to post revenue of $124 billion this quarter, a nice 3% year-over-year increase. EPS is expected to rise from $1.47 in the previous quarter to $2.35.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with OONEF.\n\nTo a large extent, Apple's stock relies on the emergent performance of its core iPhone lineup, which brings in a large chunk of the company's revenue. Red flags are going up for analysts regarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge. Under its services segment, which includes the App Store and subscription offers, the company, too, is focusing on slower growth compared to its previous quarters on account of regulatory pressures.\n\nInvestors will look to hear commentary on the Vision Pro headset and its broader product roadmap to get a better-educated sense of whether Apple's innovation can sustain future growth. The report also is expected to feature heavily on share buybacks and capital returns to investors.\n\nApple Shares are down about 14% from their 2024 high, and the upcoming earnings call could set the stage for how Apple's stock moves in 2025. The key risks are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple shows an expected revenue increase which could be viewed positively; however, concerns regarding plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in services pose significant risks. Additionally, the recent decline in stock price may affect market sentiment. While there is potential for a positive reaction if earnings meet or exceed expectations, the highlighted risks could dampen investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, concerns exist regarding iPhone sales plateauing and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The success of the Vision Pro and management's commentary on future product roadmaps are critical factors. Additionally, the article mentions share buybacks which is usually a positive indicator. The market's response will likely depend on whether the actual earnings and commentary exceed or fall short of these expectations. Given the existing concerns of analysts and the 14% drop from previous highs, a negative surprise could lead to a further decline. The expectation of 3% growth is relatively low for a company that Wall Street typically expects to deliver higher growth rates. As the company's stock has already decreased by 14%, some of that price reduction already accounts for anticipated decreased growth. Investors want to know what's next. Overall, the article leans slightly negative due to the concerns surrounding core revenue streams. Because of this news I predict a slight fall in the short term contingent upon the earnings call.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and general macro-economic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro headset and the extent of share buybacks will be crucial factors influencing investor sentiment.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high suggests a cautious market. Considering these factors, a small increase in price is possible if the earnings call addresses concerns effectively, but a more likely scenario is a continuation of the downward trend, or a sideways movement with limited gains. The probabilities reflect this cautious assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, expected revenue growth of 3% year-over-year and a significant increase in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35 could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, commentary on the Vision Pro headset and share buybacks may provide further upside potential. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and broader market risks (competition, macroeconomic factors) introduce downside risks. Given that Apple's stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, the market may have priced in some negativity, but the balance of risks leans slightly negative due to the uncertainty around iPhone demand and regulatory headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, highlighting expectations of a 3% year-over-year revenue increase to $124 billion and an EPS of $2.35. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures are noted. The stock has dropped 14% from its 2024 high, and investors are awaiting commentary on the Vision Pro headset and future product roadmap. The key risks mentioned are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities. Given the mixed expectations and risks, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.55, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, which is expected to show a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that Apple's stock is down 14% from its 2024 high, and the earnings call could set the stage for the stock's movement in 2025. Given these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the potential downsides (plateauing demand, regulatory pressures, and macro externalities) seem to outweigh the positives (revenue and EPS growth).\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected revenue growth (3%) and increase in EPS (from $1.47 to $2.35) suggest positive indicators. However, warning signs are present around the plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. Additionally, the stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, implying that some negative expectations may already be priced in. The earnings report could either confirm these fears or provide assurances against them. Overall, the risk factors and slower growth forecasts balance out some optimism around financial metrics.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
