(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What Analysts Expect from Apple's Q1 2025 Earnings Report\nNews Content: The release of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) Fiscal First Quarter 2025 results is anticipated to draw market players' attention, with the global market conditions taking a toll on the sector. Apple is expected to post revenue of $124 billion this quarter, a nice 3% year-over-year increase. EPS is expected to rise from $1.47 in the previous quarter to $2.35.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with OONEF.\n\nTo a large extent, Apple's stock relies on the emergent performance of its core iPhone lineup, which brings in a large chunk of the company's revenue. Red flags are going up for analysts regarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge. Under its services segment, which includes the App Store and subscription offers, the company, too, is focusing on slower growth compared to its previous quarters on account of regulatory pressures.\n\nInvestors will look to hear commentary on the Vision Pro headset and its broader product roadmap to get a better-educated sense of whether Apple's innovation can sustain future growth. The report also is expected to feature heavily on share buybacks and capital returns to investors.\n\nApple Shares are down about 14% from their 2024 high, and the upcoming earnings call could set the stage for how Apple's stock moves in 2025. The key risks are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple shows an expected revenue increase which could be viewed positively; however, concerns regarding plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in services pose significant risks. Additionally, the recent decline in stock price may affect market sentiment. While there is potential for a positive reaction if earnings meet or exceed expectations, the highlighted risks could dampen investor confidence, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, concerns exist regarding iPhone sales plateauing and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The success of the Vision Pro and management's commentary on future product roadmaps are critical factors. Additionally, the article mentions share buybacks which is usually a positive indicator. The market's response will likely depend on whether the actual earnings and commentary exceed or fall short of these expectations. Given the existing concerns of analysts and the 14% drop from previous highs, a negative surprise could lead to a further decline. The expectation of 3% growth is relatively low for a company that Wall Street typically expects to deliver higher growth rates. As the company's stock has already decreased by 14%, some of that price reduction already accounts for anticipated decreased growth. Investors want to know what's next. Overall, the article leans slightly negative due to the concerns surrounding core revenue streams. Because of this news I predict a slight fall in the short term contingent upon the earnings call.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and general macro-economic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro headset and the extent of share buybacks will be crucial factors influencing investor sentiment.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high suggests a cautious market. Considering these factors, a small increase in price is possible if the earnings call addresses concerns effectively, but a more likely scenario is a continuation of the downward trend, or a sideways movement with limited gains. The probabilities reflect this cautious assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, expected revenue growth of 3% year-over-year and a significant increase in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35 could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, commentary on the Vision Pro headset and share buybacks may provide further upside potential. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and broader market risks (competition, macroeconomic factors) introduce downside risks. Given that Apple's stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, the market may have priced in some negativity, but the balance of risks leans slightly negative due to the uncertainty around iPhone demand and regulatory headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, highlighting expectations of a 3% year-over-year revenue increase to $124 billion and an EPS of $2.35. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures are noted. The stock has dropped 14% from its 2024 high, and investors are awaiting commentary on the Vision Pro headset and future product roadmap. The key risks mentioned are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities. Given the mixed expectations and risks, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.55, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.45.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, which is expected to show a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue and a rise in EPS. However, there are concerns about plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The article also mentions that Apple's stock is down 14% from its 2024 high, and the earnings call could set the stage for the stock's movement in 2025. Given these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the potential downsides (plateauing demand, regulatory pressures, and macro externalities) seem to outweigh the positives (revenue and EPS growth).\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected revenue growth (3%) and increase in EPS (from $1.47 to $2.35) suggest positive indicators. However, warning signs are present around the plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. Additionally, the stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, implying that some negative expectations may already be priced in. The earnings report could either confirm these fears or provide assurances against them. Overall, the risk factors and slower growth forecasts balance out some optimism around financial metrics.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. A 3% expected revenue growth and a significant increase in EPS could indicate positive momentum; however, concerns regarding plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in services due to regulatory pressures dominate the narrative. The recent 14% decline from 2024 highs suggests that market sentiment may already reflect some negativity. Given the mixed signals and risks surrounding core revenue streams, the probabilities lean slightly negative. Overall, I estimate a higher chance of stock price movement downwards due to these underlying issues and the cautious analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans slightly negative, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. The key concerns remain plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in services due to regulatory pressures, and the stock already being down 14% from its high. While there's potential for a positive surprise from the Vision Pro or stronger-than-expected earnings, the risks seem to outweigh the potential reward in the short term, especially considering the broader market's uncertainties. Given the trend from the previous predictions, the information provided in this round does not deviate strongly that will change the overall trend. Therefore, a slight increase in probability of price falling is warranted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive aspects include projected revenue and EPS growth. However, significant concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower services segment growth due to regulatory pressures, and general macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro and the extent of share buybacks are crucial. The 14% drop from its 2024 high suggests a cautious market. Previous predictions range from 0.35 to 0.55 probability of a price rise. The consensus leans slightly towards a fall, but the uncertainty is high.  Given the mixed signals, and considering the already-priced-in negative sentiment due to the 14% drop and the inherent risk of not meeting expectations even with the projected growth, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.  The earnings call's commentary will be pivotal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, the expected revenue growth of 3% year-over-year and a significant rise in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35 could positively influence investor sentiment. Additionally, potential updates on the Vision Pro headset and share buybacks may provide further support. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and broader market risks (competition, macroeconomic factors) introduce significant downside risks. Given that Apple's stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, some negative expectations may be priced in, but the balance of risks leans slightly negative due to the uncertainty around iPhone demand and regulatory headwinds. Considering the mixed signals and the cautious tone of previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company is expected to post a 3% year-over-year revenue increase to $124 billion and a rise in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35, which could be viewed positively. However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and broader market risks such as competition and macroeconomic factors introduce significant downside risks. The stock has already declined by 14% from its 2024 high, indicating that some negative expectations may already be priced in. The upcoming earnings call and management's commentary on the Vision Pro headset, future product roadmap, and share buybacks will be crucial in determining investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the balance of risks leans slightly negative, but the potential for a positive reaction if earnings meet or exceed expectations should not be overlooked.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with expected revenue growth and increase in EPS suggesting positive indicators, but warning signs present around plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, implying that some negative expectations may already be priced in. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but also taking into account the potential for a positive reaction if earnings meet or exceed expectations, the estimated probabilities are adjusted accordingly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, expected revenue growth (3%) and a significant increase in EPS (from $1.47 to $2.35) indicate strong financial performance. The potential impact of the Vision Pro headset and share buybacks could provide additional upside. However, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and broader market risks such as competition and macroeconomic factors. Given that the stock has already declined by 14% from its 2024 high, part of the negativity might already be priced in. Investors are looking for reassurance on the iPhone sales and regulatory headwinds.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news regarding Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed outlook. While revenue growth of 3% year-over-year and an EPS increase are positive signs, there are significant concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures. The recent 14% decline from the 2024 high suggests that some negative sentiment may already be priced in, but broader macroeconomic risks remain a concern. Analysts have generally leaned towards higher probabilities of a stock price fall given these factors. Therefore, the risks outweigh the positives, leading to a forecast of a higher likelihood of the stock price falling versus rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report expectations reveals a complex and somewhat pessimistic picture. While a 3% revenue increase and a notable EPS jump are projected, these positives are overshadowed by concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slowed services growth stemming from regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, the stock's 14% dip from its 2024 peak highlights existing market anxieties. The success of Vision Pro and share buybacks could potentially alleviate these concerns, but the overall sentiment leans toward caution. The previous round's predictions also reflect this uncertainty, with most models favoring a slight downward trend. Given the combination of lukewarm revenue growth, significant headwinds in iPhone and service sectors, and pre-existing negative market sentiment, the probability of a price fall is moderately higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed outlook. While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, significant concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and general macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro and the extent of share buybacks are crucial factors that will influence investor sentiment. The 14% drop from the 2024 high suggests a cautious market that has already priced in some negative expectations.  The consensus from previous predictions leans slightly towards a price fall, with most models predicting a higher probability of a decline. This is largely due to concerns about core revenue streams not meeting expectations, despite the projected growth.  While a positive surprise on earnings could drive a rise, the inherent risks and the already-priced-in negativity make a price fall more likely in the short term. The commentary on the Vision Pro and future product roadmap will play a crucial role in determining investor sentiment and subsequent price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive aspects include a 3% year-over-year revenue increase to $124 billion and a significant rise in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35, which could bolster investor confidence.

(AAPL). The company is expected to post a 3% year-over-year revenue increase to $124 billion and a rise in EPS from $1.47 to $2.35, which could be viewed positively.

Considering these factors, the balance of risks leans slightly negative, but the potential for a positive reaction if earnings meet or exceed expectations should not be overlooked. Based on the analysis and the trend of previous predictions, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.41, while the probability of the stock price falling is 0.59.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with expected revenue growth and increase in EPS suggesting positive indicators, but warning signs present around plateauing consumer demand for iPhones and slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures.

Given that the stock has already declined by 14% from its 2024 high, part of the negativity might already be priced in. Investors are looking for reassurance on the iPhone sales and regulatory headwinds.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 2025 earnings report. Although projected revenue growth of 3% and an increase in EPS to $2.35 are positive indicators, significant concerns remain regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and broad macroeconomic uncertainties. With the stock already down 14% from its recent high, some negative expectations may be priced in. However, the overall sentiment leans towards caution due to these headwinds, suggesting a higher likelihood of a price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While there's an expected revenue increase and EPS growth, concerns around plateauing iPhone sales and regulatory pressures on the services sector weigh heavily. The stock's 14% drop from its high also indicates existing market concerns. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a fall, primarily due to these concerns. The Vision Pro potential and share buybacks offer some potential upside but are unlikely to offset the negative sentiment surrounding core revenue streams. I am assigning consistent weight with previous predictions, and keeping the fall probability elevated by some margin.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's Q1 2025 earnings presents a mixed outlook. While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, significant concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and general macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro and the extent of share buybacks are crucial factors influencing investor sentiment. The 14% drop from the 2024 high suggests a cautious market that has already priced in some negative expectations.  The consensus from previous predictions consistently leans towards a price fall, primarily due to concerns about core revenue streams not meeting expectations despite projected growth.  While a positive surprise on earnings could drive a rise, the inherent risks and the already-priced-in negativity make a price fall more likely in the short term.  The commentary on the Vision Pro and future product roadmap will be pivotal.  Considering the overall sentiment, the relatively low projected growth rate (3%), and the existing market skepticism, the probability of a price fall is considered slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news regarding Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, the expected 3% year-over-year revenue growth and significant EPS increase ($1.47 to $2.35) are strong indicators that could bolster investor confidence.

The stock has already declined by 14% from its 2024 high, suggesting that some negative expectations may already be priced in.

While these metrics indicate positive financial performance, concerns over plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in services due to regulatory pressures, and broader macroeconomic risks create significant downside risks. The recent 14% decline from the 2024 high suggests that some negative sentiments may already be priced in, yet the overall cautious analyst sentiment and risk factors suggest that the market may still respond negatively to these risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
