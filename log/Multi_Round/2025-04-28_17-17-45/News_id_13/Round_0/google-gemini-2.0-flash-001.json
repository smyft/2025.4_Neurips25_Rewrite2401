While the article emphasizes the rule of law and consumer protection rather than explicitly targeting US companies, the mention of Trump's criticism suggests an ongoing concern about bias. Generally, regulatory scrutiny and potential fines are viewed negatively by investors. However, the article doesn't announce any new fines or investigations; it's primarily commentary. Therefore, the impact on the stock is likely to be mild. I believe a stock price fall is slightly more probable, but the change could be minimal.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
