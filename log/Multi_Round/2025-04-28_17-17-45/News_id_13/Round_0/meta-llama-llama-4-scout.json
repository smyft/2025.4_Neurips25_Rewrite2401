However, the content does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or any direct actions against it. The EU's antitrust enforcement is a regulatory issue that could affect Apple, but the news does not provide a clear negative or positive impact on the company. Given that the news is more about the general regulatory environment and not specifically targeting Apple, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. However, considering the overall sentiment around regulatory scrutiny on big tech, there might be a slightly negative perception. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
