While the news mentions Trump's criticism of EU antitrust enforcement against US businesses, the statement from EU's competition chief focuses on the legal basis of the fines, downplaying the potential for politically motivated action against Apple.  Therefore, the direct impact to Apple is minimal, as the news doesn't detail any specific action against Apple itself or suggest a change in regulatory outlook.  Market reaction will likely be muted. The probability of a significant price movement (up or down) is low due to the lack of direct and specific implications for Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
