      "content": "{\n\"reasoning\": \"The news article mentions the EU's antitrust fines on big tech companies, including potentially Apple, but the statement from the EU's Competition Chief Ribera does not introduce new or unexpected information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Ribera's comments are more of a response to political pressure and a reiteration of the EU's commitment to fair competition. Given that the article does not contain any specific negative or positive news directly affecting Apple's business operations, financials, or products, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. However, any mention of regulatory scrutiny can potentially lead to a slight increase in uncertainty, which might slightly lean towards a neutral to negative outlook.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}"
