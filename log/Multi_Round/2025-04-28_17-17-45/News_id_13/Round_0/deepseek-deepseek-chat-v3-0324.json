This could imply potential regulatory risks or fines for Apple, which might negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the market has previously priced in some level of regulatory scrutiny for Big Tech firms. The mention of Trump's criticism adds political uncertainty but doesn't directly affect Apple's operations. Given Apple's strong financial position and diversified revenue streams, the immediate impact may be muted. The probability of a fall is slightly higher due to regulatory risks, but the rise probability remains notable due to Apple's resilience.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
