(AAPL)\nNews Headline: EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\nNews Content: Ribera said that regulators are \u201cbound by the rule of law\u201d and that it is the EU executive\u2019s duty to protect consumers. Trump recently lashed out at the EU for its antitrust enforcement against U.S. businesses.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news outlines the EU's stance on antitrust fines, clarifying that they are not classified as taxes. While this situation could potentially result in financial implications for large tech companies like Apple, there appears to be a degree of reassurance from the regulators, indicating a structured legal approach. Moreover, the news does not introduce any immediate negative catalysts specifically regarding Apple, suggesting that the market may not react strongly against its stock. Presents a mixed impact but leans toward a neutral to slightly positive response in the short term, limiting drastic movements in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests continued antitrust pressure from the EU on Big Tech, specifically mentioning Apple potentially being subject to fines. While the article emphasizes the rule of law and consumer protection rather than explicitly targeting US companies, the mention of Trump's criticism suggests an ongoing concern about bias. Generally, regulatory scrutiny and potential fines are viewed negatively by investors. However, the article doesn't announce any new fines or investigations; it's primarily commentary. Therefore, the impact on the stock is likely to be mild. I believe a stock price fall is slightly more probable, but the change could be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses EU antitrust fines and clarifies that they are not a tax.  While the news mentions Trump's criticism of EU antitrust enforcement against US businesses, the statement from EU's competition chief focuses on the legal basis of the fines, downplaying the potential for politically motivated action against Apple.  Therefore, the direct impact to Apple is minimal, as the news doesn't detail any specific action against Apple itself or suggest a change in regulatory outlook.  Market reaction will likely be muted. The probability of a significant price movement (up or down) is low due to the lack of direct and specific implications for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the EU is reinforcing its stance on antitrust enforcement against Big Tech companies, including Apple. This could imply potential regulatory risks or fines for Apple, which might negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the market has previously priced in some level of regulatory scrutiny for Big Tech firms. The mention of Trump's criticism adds political uncertainty but doesn't directly affect Apple's operations. Given Apple's strong financial position and diversified revenue streams, the immediate impact may be muted. The probability of a fall is slightly higher due to regulatory risks, but the rise probability remains notable due to Apple's resilience.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses EU's antitrust fines and its implications on big tech companies. However, the content does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or any direct actions against it. The EU's antitrust enforcement is a regulatory issue that could affect Apple, but the news does not provide a clear negative or positive impact on the company. Given that the news is more about the general regulatory environment and not specifically targeting Apple, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral. However, considering the overall sentiment around regulatory scrutiny on big tech, there might be a slightly negative perception. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article mentions the EU's antitrust fines on big tech companies, including potentially Apple, but the statement from the EU's Competition Chief Ribera does not introduce new or unexpected information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Ribera's comments are more of a response to political pressure and a reiteration of the EU's commitment to fair competition. Given that the article does not contain any specific negative or positive news directly affecting Apple's business operations, financials, or products, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. However, any mention of regulatory scrutiny can potentially lead to a slight increase in uncertainty, which might slightly lean towards a neutral to negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential for increased antitrust scrutiny from the EU against Big Tech companies, specifically mentioning U.S. businesses. While the statement by EU's competition chief emphasizes that these fines aren't interpreted as taxes, recent comments by Trump criticizing the EU's actions suggest ongoing geopolitical tensions. Given Apple's significant operations within Europe, it could face potential fines and increased regulatory scrutiny which might weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines, reiterating that they are not a tax and emphasizing the rule of law. While this could imply continued regulatory scrutiny for Big Tech, including Apple, there are no immediate negative events specifically targeting the company. Most predictions lean towards a mostly neutral to slightly negative outlook given the persistent concerns around regulatory scrutiny. Nevertheless, the reassurance from regulators mitigates the immediate risk, keeping the probabilities more balanced. Considering past predictions and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations, I estimate the probabilities to reflect a slight downside risk due to the ongoing scrutiny and general market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on the EU's stance on antitrust fines for Big Tech, including potential implications for Apple. The EU competition chief emphasizes that the fines aren't taxes, but rather enforcement of consumer protection laws. Trump's criticism adds a layer of political context. Considering previous predictions leaning slightly toward a negative impact due to regulatory scrutiny (although the current news doesn't announce new investigations or fines) and acknowledging that Apple's influence and financial strength could mitigate potential negative effects, my prediction is cautiously neutral. However, I think the trend is that the stock price movement towards falling is slowing down. Therefore, I'm slightly increasing the probability of the stock price rising compared to others' prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple. While it discusses EU antitrust fines and mentions potential implications for US tech companies, it doesn't contain any specific negative news about Apple itself.  The EU's clarification that the fines aren't a tax aims to de-escalate the situation, and the news lacks any new information about specific investigations or penalties targeting Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning slightly towards a price drop due to general regulatory uncertainty and others predicting a neutral impact. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple, and the overall mixed sentiment previously expressed, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of no significant movement.  However, the inherent uncertainty surrounding regulatory pressures for large tech companies warrants accounting for a slight possibility of both price increase and decrease. I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this relatively neutral outlook compared to the initial predictions, which heavily leaned toward a fall in multiple instances.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's antitrust fines and regulatory stance on Big Tech, with a focus on consumer protection and the rule of law. While the article does not directly mention any new actions against Apple specifically, it highlights ongoing regulatory scrutiny that could affect U.S. businesses, including Apple. The mention of Trump's criticism adds a layer of geopolitical tension but does not introduce immediate negative or positive catalysts for Apple's stock. Given the lack of direct, company-specific news, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, with a slight edge towards falling due to the general negative sentiment around increased regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines and how they are not classified as taxes, which provides a degree of reassurance that the regulatory approach is structured and based on the rule of law. While this situation could potentially result in financial implications for large tech companies like Apple, there are no immediate negative catalysts specifically regarding Apple mentioned in the news. The EU's antitrust enforcement is a regulatory issue that could affect Apple, but given that the news does not provide a clear negative or positive impact on the company, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. The mention of Trump's criticism adds political uncertainty but doesn't directly affect Apple's operations. Considering the information provided and the general regulatory environment, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of a negative perception due to potential fines and increased scrutiny. However, given Apple's strong financial position and diversified revenue streams, the immediate impact may be muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the EU's antitrust fines and the statement from the EU's Competition Chief Ribera, which does not introduce new or unexpected information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The article's focus on the EU's commitment to fair competition and the clarification that antitrust fines are not taxes suggests a neutral to slightly positive tone. However, considering the overall sentiment around regulatory scrutiny on big tech and the potential for geopolitical tensions, there might be a slightly negative perception. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed opinion among the models, but most of them lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook. Taking this into account, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential for increased antitrust scrutiny from the EU against Big Tech companies, specifically mentioning U.S. businesses. While the statement by EU's competition chief emphasizes that these fines aren't interpreted as taxes, recent comments by Trump criticizing the EU's actions suggest ongoing geopolitical tensions. The news lacks specific implications for Apple, leading to a range of predicted reactions. Previous models predict a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to the general regulatory concern and geopolitical tension.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that the EU is reaffirming its stance on antitrust fines, clarifying that these fines should not be perceived as taxes, which suggests an approach anchored in legality and consumer protection. While this highlights ongoing regulatory scrutiny that could potentially affect large tech companies like Apple, it doesn't introduce any immediate negative developments directly impacting Apple. Most models indicate a mixed but slightly negative sentiment, reflecting concerns over regulatory pressures. However, the absence of any new fines or investigations could help mitigate the overall impact. Thus, the probabilities of both rising and falling stock prices are nearly balanced, but with a slightly higher inclination towards a fall due to the general sentiment surrounding increased scrutiny.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's antitrust stance and counters the notion of fines being taxes, framing them as consumer protection measures. This reiterates existing regulatory pressure on Big Tech, including potential implications for Apple. While there's no specific new negative development directly targeting Apple, the recurring theme of regulatory scrutiny usually creates investor uncertainty. Previous predictions have fluctuated but generally lean towards a slightly negative outlook reflecting the perceived regulatory risk. However, some correction towards neutral position is observed as the news does not have any direct impact on the financials or outlook of Apple. Furthermore, the slight geopolitical concerns regarding Trump's response may also negatively impact the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple.  While it discusses EU antitrust fines and their potential impact on US tech companies, it doesn't contain any specific negative news about Apple. The EU's clarification that the fines aren't a tax aims to de-escalate the situation. The news lacks new information about specific investigations or penalties targeting Apple. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price drop due to general regulatory uncertainty.  However, the overall sentiment has shifted slightly towards neutral in the second round of predictions. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple and its strong financial position, the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) is low.  The ongoing regulatory scrutiny and general market sentiment contribute to a slightly higher likelihood of a minor price drop, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's antitrust fines and regulatory stance on Big Tech, with a focus on consumer protection and the rule of law. While the article does not directly mention any new actions against Apple specifically, it highlights ongoing regulatory scrutiny that could affect U.S. businesses, including Apple. The mention of Trump's criticism adds a layer of geopolitical tension but does not introduce immediate negative or positive catalysts for Apple's stock. Given the lack of direct, company-specific news, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, with a slight edge towards falling due to the general negative sentiment around increased regulatory scrutiny. Previous predictions also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook, which supports this assessment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines for Big Tech companies, emphasizing that these fines are not taxes but rather enforcement of consumer protection laws. While there are no immediate negative catalysts specifically targeting Apple, the ongoing regulatory scrutiny could potentially impact the company's stock. Previous predictions have been mixed, with a general leaning towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. However, given that the news does not introduce new specific actions against Apple and emphasizes the rule of law, the impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, but overall, the movement is expected to be muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines, emphasizing they are not taxes, and focuses on the rule of law and consumer protection. While this could imply continued regulatory scrutiny for Big Tech, including Apple, there are no immediate negative events specifically targeting the company. Analyzing previous predictions, most models lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to general regulatory concern and geopolitical tension. Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations and the mixed sentiment among previous predictions, I estimate the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling compared to rising, but with a balanced approach given the reassurance from regulators and Apple's strong financial position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The recent news discusses the EU's reaffirmation of antitrust fines as not being taxes, emphasizing a commitment to legality and consumer protection. While the emphasis on regulatory scrutiny indicates potential challenges for companies like Apple, there are no new specific negative developments directly affecting Apple. Most predictions reflect a cautious sentiment, leaning slightly negative due to ongoing regulatory pressures, geopolitical tensions introduced by comments from Trump, and the broader market sentiment around tech companies. The probabilities of price movement remain balanced but slightly skewed towards a fall due to these factors. Given these insights and the lack of immediate implications, I estimate a small probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's antitrust stance and refutes the idea of fines being taxes, highlighting them as consumer protection measures. Although this implies ongoing regulatory pressure on Big Tech, which includes Apple, there are no immediate negative developments specifically targeting the company. Prior predictions have generally leaned slightly negative due to regulatory concerns and geopolitical tensions. However, the absence of specific negative actions in the news, plus the EU framing fines as consumer protection measures indicate no significant changes to Apple's risk profile. So, the probability of minor changes to Apple's stock price is high. Also Trump's criticism may add minor geopolitical tension to the stock price. Therefore, while the stock price may more like fall, its extent may be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content are largely neutral regarding Apple.  While the EU's stance on antitrust fines and their potential impact on US tech companies is mentioned, there's no specific negative news directly affecting Apple. The EU's clarification that the fines aren't a tax aims to de-escalate the situation.  Previous predictions are mixed, but there's a slight tendency towards a price drop due to general regulatory uncertainty. However, the absence of specific negative news about Apple and its strong financial position mitigate the risk.  The ongoing regulatory scrutiny and general market sentiment contribute to a slight likelihood of a minor price drop, but the overall impact is likely minimal.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this relatively neutral outlook but with a slight negativity incorporated because of general regulatory uncertainty surrounding Big Tech.  The trend in previous rounds also demonstrates a general move toward neutrality, with the probability of falling decreasing over each round.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines for Big Tech companies, emphasizing that these fines are not taxes but rather enforcement of consumer protection laws. While this could imply continued regulatory scrutiny for Apple, there are no immediate negative events specifically targeting the company. Previous predictions have been mixed, with a general leaning towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. However, given that the news does not introduce new specific actions against Apple and emphasizes the rule of law, the impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, but overall, the movement is expected to be muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines for Big Tech companies, emphasizing that these fines are not taxes but rather enforcement of consumer protection laws. While there are no immediate negative catalysts specifically targeting Apple, the ongoing regulatory scrutiny could potentially impact the company's stock.

Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, but overall, the movement is expected to be muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news discusses the EU's stance on antitrust fines, emphasizing they are not taxes, and focuses on the rule of law and consumer protection. While this could imply continued regulatory scrutiny for Big Tech, including Apple, there are no immediate negative events specifically targeting the company. Analyzing previous predictions, most models lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to general regulatory concern and geopolitical tension. Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations and the mixed sentiment among previous predictions, I estimate the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling compared to rising, but with a balanced approach given the reassurance from regulators and Apple's strong financial position.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the continued stance on antitrust fines imposed by the EU on big tech companies. The emphasis on these fines not being treated as taxes and the reassurance of the approach being based on legal standards suggest a structured mechanism for regulation. There is no specific mention of Apple facing any new sanctions, fines, or investigations, which mitigates immediate negative impacts on the company. Predominant analyses from previous rounds tend towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to ongoing regulatory scrutiny, geopolitical factors, and generalized market sentiment. Despite the reassurance provided by the clarification, the persistent concern around regulatory pressures for large tech companies continues to cast a shadow. Hence, while the news isn\u2019t immediately alarming for Apple, it contributes to a subdued investor sentiment and could slightly favor a marginally negative perception.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
