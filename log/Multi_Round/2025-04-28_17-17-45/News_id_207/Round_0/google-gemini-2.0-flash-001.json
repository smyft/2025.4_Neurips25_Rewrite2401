While Apple doesn't disclose specific financial details for its streaming operation, the success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest increasing revenue streams. The positive sentiment is further reinforced by the data from Parrot Analytics, which values the income contribution of individual titles. However, note that Apple is a trillion-dollar company and the impact of their streaming division, while having strong upside potential, may be overshadowed by other factors (global supply chain, macroeconomic conditions) which drive far more of the company's revenues. The news does not mention the value of that metric as a percentage of Apple's yearly revenue nor does the news mention the company's future outlook. Therefore, the impact, while positive, may not be significant enough to substantially move the stock price but instead keep the stock price steady.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple TV+ Expands Streaming Dominance with $200 Million Success of 'Severance' Season 1\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
