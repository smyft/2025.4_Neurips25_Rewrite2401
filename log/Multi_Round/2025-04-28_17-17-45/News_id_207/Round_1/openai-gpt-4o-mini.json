Parrot Analytics credits its weekly release schedulewhich promotes rewatching and catch-up viewing even after the season finalefor the show's consistent income generating.\n\nApple is also hinting to Ted Lasso maybe having a fourth season. With more than $600 million in income throughout its three-year run, the blockbuster comedy series has become pillar of the platform.\n\nUsing its own Content Valuation approach, Parrot Analyticsa company focused on audience measurement and performance analysis for entertainment contentestimates the income effect of individual titles across certain geographies.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the successful performance of Apple TV+'s 'Severance' Season 1, generating over $200 million in income, which showcases Apple's effective strategy in streaming content. The continuation of popular shows like 'Ted Lasso' further solidifies the strength of their streaming platform. This positive development in revenue generation suggests potential for growth in Apple's overall business, especially in the digital services segment. While Apple has not disclosed specific financials for its streaming operations, the positive reception and income reports may lead to an increase in investor confidence. Therefore, there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates positive growth for Apple's streaming service, Apple TV+, with 'Severance' being a significant income generator. While Apple doesn't disclose specific financial details for its streaming operation, the success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest increasing revenue streams. The positive sentiment is further reinforced by the data from Parrot Analytics, which values the income contribution of individual titles. However, note that Apple is a trillion-dollar company and the impact of their streaming division, while having strong upside potential, may be overshadowed by other factors (global supply chain, macroeconomic conditions) which drive far more of the company's revenues. The news does not mention the value of that metric as a percentage of Apple's yearly revenue nor does the news mention the company's future outlook. Therefore, the impact, while positive, may not be significant enough to substantially move the stock price but instead keep the stock price steady.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ shows, particularly \"Severance,\" generating significant revenue.  While $200 million is a substantial amount, it's crucial to consider this within the context of Apple's overall financial performance. Apple is a massive company, and the impact of Apple TV+ revenue on the total stock price is likely to be relatively small.  The news is positive, suggesting growth in Apple's streaming services, but it's not a game-changing event that would drastically affect Apple's overall valuation.  The mention of a potential fourth season of Ted Lasso further adds to the positive sentiment, although this is not confirmed.  Considering Apple's size and diversification, the effect on the stock price is unlikely to be dramatic. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is modest, primarily due to the positive sentiment surrounding the success of its streaming content.  The probability of a price fall is low, assuming no other negative news simultaneously affects the stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million, which is a positive indicator for Apple's streaming service. The success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest strong performance in Apple's services segment, which is a key growth area for the company. However, Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, which may limit the immediate impact on the stock price. Overall, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, but the effect may be moderate given the lack of specific financial data and the fact that streaming is just one part of Apple's diverse business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights the success of Apple TV+ series 'Severance', which has generated over $200 million in its first season. This success, along with the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso', indicates a positive outlook for Apple's streaming services. Although Apple does not disclose specific financial information for its streaming operation, the performance of its shows suggests a growing and profitable segment. This positive development in Apple's content offerings is likely to have a favorable impact on the company's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the success of Apple TV+ series 'Severance' with a $200 million income from its first season, indicating a positive performance for the streaming platform. Additionally, the announcement of a potential fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' and its significant income contribution suggests a strong content lineup for Apple TV+. This positive news is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any direct financial information or significant surprises that would drastically alter the market's expectation. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, but not excessively high due to the lack of groundbreaking news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance'. This strong performance indicates a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business, which is a critical component of its services segment. Additionally, hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season, further suggest continued growth and engagement on Apple TV+. Such developments are likely to boost investor confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
