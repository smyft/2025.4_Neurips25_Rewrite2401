(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple TV+ Expands Streaming Dominance with $200 Million Success of 'Severance' Season 1\"\nNews Content: With its first season producing over $200 million, Apple TV+ series Severance has become a major income source for the streaming platform. Data published by Deadline and derived from Parrot Analytics shows that this performance beats the $184.8 million generated by Slow Horses but behind the $299.4 million pulled in by The Morning Show.\n\nLast Friday's launch episode of the second season highlights Apple's ongoing attempts to establish Severance as a flagship show that goes with its premium brand. Parrot Analytics credits its weekly release schedulewhich promotes rewatching and catch-up viewing even after the season finalefor the show's consistent income generating.\n\nApple is also hinting to Ted Lasso maybe having a fourth season. With more than $600 million in income throughout its three-year run, the blockbuster comedy series has become pillar of the platform.\n\nUsing its own Content Valuation approach, Parrot Analyticsa company focused on audience measurement and performance analysis for entertainment contentestimates the income effect of individual titles across certain geographies. This approach assesses a show's income contribution over a certain period, therefore providing information on its worth for streaming services.\n\nApple (AAPL, Financials) has not revealed particular financial information for its streaming operation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the successful performance of Apple TV+'s 'Severance' Season 1, generating over $200 million in income, which showcases Apple's effective strategy in streaming content. The continuation of popular shows like 'Ted Lasso' further solidifies the strength of their streaming platform. This positive development in revenue generation suggests potential for growth in Apple's overall business, especially in the digital services segment. While Apple has not disclosed specific financials for its streaming operations, the positive reception and income reports may lead to an increase in investor confidence. Therefore, there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates positive growth for Apple's streaming service, Apple TV+, with 'Severance' being a significant income generator. While Apple doesn't disclose specific financial details for its streaming operation, the success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest increasing revenue streams. The positive sentiment is further reinforced by the data from Parrot Analytics, which values the income contribution of individual titles. However, note that Apple is a trillion-dollar company and the impact of their streaming division, while having strong upside potential, may be overshadowed by other factors (global supply chain, macroeconomic conditions) which drive far more of the company's revenues. The news does not mention the value of that metric as a percentage of Apple's yearly revenue nor does the news mention the company's future outlook. Therefore, the impact, while positive, may not be significant enough to substantially move the stock price but instead keep the stock price steady.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ shows, particularly \"Severance,\" generating significant revenue.  While $200 million is a substantial amount, it's crucial to consider this within the context of Apple's overall financial performance. Apple is a massive company, and the impact of Apple TV+ revenue on the total stock price is likely to be relatively small.  The news is positive, suggesting growth in Apple's streaming services, but it's not a game-changing event that would drastically affect Apple's overall valuation.  The mention of a potential fourth season of Ted Lasso further adds to the positive sentiment, although this is not confirmed.  Considering Apple's size and diversification, the effect on the stock price is unlikely to be dramatic. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is modest, primarily due to the positive sentiment surrounding the success of its streaming content.  The probability of a price fall is low, assuming no other negative news simultaneously affects the stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million, which is a positive indicator for Apple's streaming service. The success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest strong performance in Apple's services segment, which is a key growth area for the company. However, Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, which may limit the immediate impact on the stock price. Overall, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, but the effect may be moderate given the lack of specific financial data and the fact that streaming is just one part of Apple's diverse business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights the success of Apple TV+ series 'Severance', which has generated over $200 million in its first season. This success, along with the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso', indicates a positive outlook for Apple's streaming services. Although Apple does not disclose specific financial information for its streaming operation, the performance of its shows suggests a growing and profitable segment. This positive development in Apple's content offerings is likely to have a favorable impact on the company's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the success of Apple TV+ series 'Severance' with a $200 million income from its first season, indicating a positive performance for the streaming platform. Additionally, the announcement of a potential fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' and its significant income contribution suggests a strong content lineup for Apple TV+. This positive news is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any direct financial information or significant surprises that would drastically alter the market's expectation. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, but not excessively high due to the lack of groundbreaking news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance'. This strong performance indicates a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business, which is a critical component of its services segment. Additionally, hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season, further suggest continued growth and engagement on Apple TV+. Such developments are likely to boost investor confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The positive financial news regarding the successful performance of Apple TV+'s 'Severance' and hints at the continuation of 'Ted Lasso' indicate a strengthening revenue stream for Apple in its services segment. This success boosts investor confidence and suggests growth potential, even if the impact on the overall stock price may not be massive given Apple's extensive size and revenue sources. Most previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of price rise due to this favorable news, so I estimate that the stock price will have a higher likelihood of increasing than decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive, highlighting the success of Apple TV+'s 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' both generating significant revenue. This reinforces the strength of Apple's streaming platform and its potential for future growth in the services segment. Considering the previous rounds consistently predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to this news and given the overall positive sentiment, I will maintain a strong probability of an increase. I will take a slightly more cautious approach, as many others had quite high stock increase probability ratings, but the actual magnitude of the financial contribution of the streaming platform to the overall company's revenue is still unknown. Also, I will slightly increase the fall probability compared to others. Considering the current market's uncertainties, while the news is positive, broader economic factors could still influence the stock negatively. This is similar to other rounds, but with minor adjustment to the probability numbers due to market condition.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' generating over $200 million.  This adds to the positive sentiment around Apple's growing services segment. However, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be minimal given its size and diversification.  The $200 million, while significant for Apple TV+, is a small fraction of Apple's overall revenue. The previous predictions range from 0.6 to 0.75 for a price rise, reflecting this nuanced perspective.  While the news is good, it's not a major catalyst for a significant stock price movement. Considering the consensus of previous predictions and the limited impact of this news on Apple's massive overall revenue, a moderate increase in stock price is more likely than a decrease or no change. I've slightly adjusted the probabilities to reflect the consensus while accounting for the relatively small impact of this specific news item on a company as large as Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million, which is a positive indicator for Apple's streaming service. The success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest strong performance in Apple's services segment, a key growth area for the company. While Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, the positive sentiment and potential revenue growth from its streaming platform are likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, given Apple's massive size and diversified business, the impact on the stock price may be moderate. The overall sentiment from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, albeit not drastically.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant success of Apple TV+ with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million in its first season. Additionally, there are hints of a potential fourth season for 'Ted Lasso', another popular show. These developments indicate a positive performance for Apple's streaming services, which is a growing segment of the company's business. While Apple does not disclose specific financial details for its streaming operation, the success of these shows suggests a strong and profitable content lineup. This positive news is likely to boost investor confidence in Apple's strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price. However, given the size and diversification of Apple, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million, and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggests strong performance in Apple's services segment. This positive development in revenue generation, combined with the overall success of Apple TV+'s content offerings, is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the predictions from previous rounds, which show a general consensus towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, and taking into account the lack of specific financial data that might limit the immediate impact, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly above 0.6. The probability of the stock price falling is lower, given the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple's streaming services.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news regarding Apple TV+'s successful performance with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million is significant for its streaming division. The highlight of its strong performance, complemented by hints of a potential continuation for another popular show 'Ted Lasso', suggests a positive trajectory for Apple's service revenues. Although Apple is a giant company and this revenue is a small fraction of its overall income, the successful performance of these shows signals investor confidence and a strengthening services segment which is crucial for future growth. Given the previous predictions and consistent positive sentiment surrounding this news, I estimate a higher probability of stock price increase than a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news is positive, focusing on the success of Apple TV+ and its hit show 'Severance,' which has generated significant revenue. The potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' further contributes to the positive outlook for Apple's streaming services. Previous rounds of predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it's important to remember that Apple is a massive company, and the impact of Apple TV+'s revenue, while positive, is likely to be relatively small compared to the company's overall revenue. Considering the previous predictions and the size of Apple, I believe a moderate rise is more likely than a significant jump. Also, the current market condition is volatile and the broader market trend might affect the direction of the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' generating over $200 million in revenue.  This adds to the positive sentiment surrounding Apple's growing services segment. However, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be modest due to the company's massive size and diverse revenue streams. The $200 million, while significant for Apple TV+, represents a relatively small portion of Apple's total revenue.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities for a price rise (0.6 to 0.75), reflecting the nuanced impact of this news.  While good news, it's unlikely to act as a major catalyst for a significant stock price movement. Considering the overall positive sentiment, the previous predictions, and the limited impact of this news item within Apple's larger financial picture, a slight increase in stock price is more probable than a decrease. I've considered the potential for the positive news to boost investor confidence, but this impact is likely to be small compared to other factors that influence AAPL's share price.  Therefore, I'm assigning a probability reflective of a moderate, yet positive, impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the series 'Severance' generating over $200 million in its first season, which is a significant achievement for Apple's streaming platform. The potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' and its substantial income contribution further strengthens the positive outlook for Apple's services segment. While Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, the success of these shows suggests a strong and profitable content lineup.

These developments point to a strong performance in Apple's streaming service segment, which could boost investor confidence. While Apple's streaming service is growing, it represents only a fraction of Apple's overall revenue, limiting the immediate impact on the stock price.
