(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's China Nightmare: iPhone Sales Plummet as Huawei Surges -- Is the Empire Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges facing Apple in the Chinese market, including a 25% decline in iPhone sales year over year while competitors like Huawei are gaining market share. This competitive pressure, coupled with Apple's issues finding a new credit card partner, suggests potential instability in customer spending and investor confidence. The broader implications of falling shipment expectations and the impact of possible tariffs add to the uncertainty. While Apple remains a strong company with a robust ecosystem, the negative outlook based on this news indicates a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but predominantly negative outlook for Apple. The significant decline in iPhone sales in China, coupled with Huawei's surge, represents a serious threat to a key market. The uncertainty surrounding the credit card partnership transition and the lukewarm reception to new products like Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence add to the negative sentiment. While Apple's overall market position is strong, the potential for decreased iPhone shipments and external factors like tariffs increase downside risks. Considering these factors, a stock price fall is more probable than a rise in the short term. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and customer loyalty provide some support, mitigating the probability of a drastic fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple.  While its overall market dominance and brand loyalty remain strong, significant challenges are highlighted. The substantial drop in iPhone sales in China, coupled with the potential for further competition and government subsidies, is a major negative.  The uncertainty surrounding its credit card partnership also adds to the risk.  However, Apple's vast ecosystem, strong brand, and sheer size mean that these negative factors may not have a proportionally large impact on the stock price in the short term.  The market seems to already be pricing in some of these risks, given the article's mention that analysts predict a 10% drop in iPhone shipments in 2025.  While the overall picture is concerning, a complete collapse is unlikely. The probability of a price rise is lower due to the negative news regarding declining sales in China and uncertainty in other areas, but a significant drop is also not highly probable given Apple's overall market position. Therefore, I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a small price decrease. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple, including a 25% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from Huawei and other local players, and potential disruptions in its credit card partnership. Additionally, there are concerns about future iPhone shipments, lukewarm reception to Apple's AI initiatives, and minimal impact from the Vision Pro headset. Despite Apple's strong market cap and ecosystem, the negative factors outweigh the positives, suggesting a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors affecting Apple's stock price, including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO, and challenges in finding a new credit card partner. Additionally, there are concerns about potential tariffs and the lukewarm response to Apple's AI initiatives. While Apple remains the world's most valuable company with a strong ecosystem and customer loyalty, the cumulative effect of these challenges suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges facing Apple Inc., including a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, increased competition from local players like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO, and potential uncertainty in its credit card business. Additionally, there are concerns about the company's AI play and the performance of its Vision Pro headset. While Apple still maintains a strong market position and brand loyalty, the mounting challenges suggest a potential negative impact on its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Apple in a critical market segment (China) where iPhone sales have plummeted by 25% year over year. Additionally, Apple is facing internal challenges such as transitioning its credit card partnerships, which could disrupt its financial ecosystem. While the company remains the world\u2019s most valuable, analysts project potential further falls in iPhone shipments and weak traction in new innovations like the Vision Pro headset. These factors collectively point towards heightened risks and uncertainties for Apple\u2019s future performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
