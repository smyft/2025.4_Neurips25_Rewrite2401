While Apple is not directly mentioned, it is highly influenced by broader market sentiment and is considered part of the \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" (the successor to FANG). If the overall market is experiencing a surge, as the article suggests, it's likely that Apple will also experience positive movement. The article highlights positive crypto and gold news which does not seem to have direct causal relationship to AAPL positively nor negatively. The other news bits in the article, particularly, 'Why Big Tech is a 'market to own until proven otherwise'' would indicate positive sentiment towards AAPL since it is part of 'Big Tech'. Therefore, I estimate a moderately higher probability of a price increase than decrease. It is important to note this probability is assigned based solely on the provided news and broader economic events and company-specific factors can significantly affect the stock price. This should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump rally, Mag 7 vs. FANG, bitcoin and gold: Market Takeaways\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
