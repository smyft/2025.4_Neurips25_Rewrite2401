While it mentions comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks (Apple is in the latter group),  the article doesn't offer any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the impact of this general market news on Apple's stock price is indirect.  A broad market surge usually benefits large-cap tech stocks like Apple, but the connection isn't strong enough to assign a high probability of a price increase solely based on this news. The probability is increased slightly above 0.5 because of this positive market sentiment, but the lack of Apple-specific information significantly reduces the confidence in predicting price movement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump rally, Mag 7 vs. FANG, bitcoin and gold: Market Takeaways\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
