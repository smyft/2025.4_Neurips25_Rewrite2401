A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong performing market with specific focus on the technology sector, where Apple Inc. (AAPL) operates. The positive sentiment from the new presidential term adds to market optimism, which typically benefits tech stocks like Apple. In addition, the emphasis on Big Tech as a sector to own suggests a strong likelihood for these stocks to perform well. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is relatively low amidst this overall positive market environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline primarily focuses on broader market trends associated with the return of President Trump and the performance of major market indexes. While Apple is not directly mentioned, it is highly influenced by broader market sentiment and is considered part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" (the successor to FANG). If the overall market is experiencing a surge, as the article suggests, it's likely that Apple will also experience positive movement. The article highlights positive crypto and gold news which does not seem to have direct causal relationship to AAPL positively nor negatively. The other news bits in the article, particularly, 'Why Big Tech is a 'market to own until proven otherwise'' would indicate positive sentiment towards AAPL since it is part of 'Big Tech'. Therefore, I estimate a moderately higher probability of a price increase than decrease. It is important to note this probability is assigned based solely on the provided news and broader economic events and company-specific factors can significantly affect the stock price. This should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge driven by President Trump's return to office, describing the best start to a presidential term since 1985.  While it mentions comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks (Apple is in the latter group),  the article doesn't offer any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the impact of this general market news on Apple's stock price is indirect.  A broad market surge usually benefits large-cap tech stocks like Apple, but the connection isn't strong enough to assign a high probability of a price increase solely based on this news. The probability is increased slightly above 0.5 because of this positive market sentiment, but the lack of Apple-specific information significantly reduces the confidence in predicting price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing the performance of FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices. However, the content does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct impact on its stock. Given the context of a broader market rally and Apple's inclusion in the Magnificent Seven, there is an implied positive sentiment, but the lack of company-specific news limits the certainty of the prediction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain moderate due to the general nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide information that directly relates to the company's stock performance. The news discusses the overall market performance under President Trump's return to office, comparisons between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and movements in bitcoin and gold prices. As there is no direct mention of Apple Inc. or its performance, it's challenging to estimate the stock price movement based on this news. However, given that the overall market is surging and tech stocks are often considered a 'market to own until proven otherwise,' there's a general positive sentiment that might indirectly benefit Apple Inc. Therefore, a cautious estimation would lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall market performance and trends, including the surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office. It also mentions the comparison between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the performance of bitcoin and gold. Although the article does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it provides a general overview of the market's positive sentiment. Given the positive market trend and the fact that Apple is a component of the FANG stocks, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or prospects, so the probability of a stock price rise is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
