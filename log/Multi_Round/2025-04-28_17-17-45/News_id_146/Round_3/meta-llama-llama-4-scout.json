      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump rally, Mag 7 vs. FANG, bitcoin and gold: Market Takeaways\nNews Content: US equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) surged in President Trump's first week back in office \u2014 shortened for Monday's market holiday due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day \u2014 marking the best start to a presidential term since Ronald Reagan's 1985 inauguration.\n\nYahoo Finance Markets & Data editor Jared Blikre analyzes the market's performance with Donald Trump in the White House, compares FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, while tracking bitcoin (BTC-USD) and gold prices (GC=F) as they approach record highs.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.\n\nThis post was written by Angel Smith Related Videos\n\n04:24\n\n'Most of the bad news is behind Boeing' after Q4 losses\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 6 minutes ago 03:00\n\nWhy Big Tech is a 'market to own until proven otherwise'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 30 minutes ago 05:43\n\nWhy banks now have the 'green light' to adopt bitcoin, crypto\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 50 minutes ago 01:23\n\nTwilio upgraded to Outperform by Baird, sets new $160 PT\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong performing market with specific focus on the technology sector, where Apple Inc. (AAPL) operates. The positive sentiment from the new presidential term adds to market optimism, which typically benefits tech stocks like Apple. In addition, the emphasis on Big Tech as a sector to own suggests a strong likelihood for these stocks to perform well. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is relatively low amidst this overall positive market environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline primarily focuses on broader market trends associated with the return of President Trump and the performance of major market indexes. While Apple is not directly mentioned, it is highly influenced by broader market sentiment and is considered part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" (the successor to FANG). If the overall market is experiencing a surge, as the article suggests, it's likely that Apple will also experience positive movement. The article highlights positive crypto and gold news which does not seem to have direct causal relationship to AAPL positively nor negatively. The other news bits in the article, particularly, 'Why Big Tech is a 'market to own until proven otherwise'' would indicate positive sentiment towards AAPL since it is part of 'Big Tech'. Therefore, I estimate a moderately higher probability of a price increase than decrease. It is important to note this probability is assigned based solely on the provided news and broader economic events and company-specific factors can significantly affect the stock price. This should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge driven by President Trump's return to office, describing the best start to a presidential term since 1985.  While it mentions comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks (Apple is in the latter group),  the article doesn't offer any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the impact of this general market news on Apple's stock price is indirect.  A broad market surge usually benefits large-cap tech stocks like Apple, but the connection isn't strong enough to assign a high probability of a price increase solely based on this news. The probability is increased slightly above 0.5 because of this positive market sentiment, but the lack of Apple-specific information significantly reduces the confidence in predicting price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing the performance of FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices. However, the content does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct impact on its stock. Given the context of a broader market rally and Apple's inclusion in the Magnificent Seven, there is an implied positive sentiment, but the lack of company-specific news limits the certainty of the prediction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain moderate due to the general nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide information that directly relates to the company's stock performance. The news discusses the overall market performance under President Trump's return to office, comparisons between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and movements in bitcoin and gold prices. As there is no direct mention of Apple Inc. or its performance, it's challenging to estimate the stock price movement based on this news. However, given that the overall market is surging and tech stocks are often considered a 'market to own until proven otherwise,' there's a general positive sentiment that might indirectly benefit Apple Inc. Therefore, a cautious estimation would lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the overall market performance and trends, including the surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office. It also mentions the comparison between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the performance of bitcoin and gold. Although the article does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it provides a general overview of the market's positive sentiment. Given the positive market trend and the fact that Apple is a component of the FANG stocks, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or prospects, so the probability of a stock price rise is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The recent news highlights a strong surge in US equity markets during the first week of President Trump's return to office, suggesting overall positive market sentiment. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned, it is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and likely benefits from the broader positive market trends associated with big tech stocks. The emphasis on favorable conditions for technology stocks increases the likelihood of Apple's share price rising. Therefore, even though specific information about Apple's performance is lacking, the overall sentiment leans towards a higher probability of an increase in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive market sentiment due to Trump's return and strong performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\", which includes Apple. Previous predictions ranged from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, with most clustered around 0.6. Considering these prior opinions and the generally positive market outlook, the probability of AAPL rising is moderately high. However, the news lacks explicit AAPL-specific details, preventing an even higher probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on a broad market surge driven by positive sentiment surrounding President Trump's return.  While Apple is not directly mentioned, its inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' implies a positive correlation with the overall market's performance.  The positive sentiment towards Big Tech further strengthens the case for a potential stock price increase. However, the absence of Apple-specific news means the relationship is indirect, and a significant price movement is less certain. Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, and reflect a similar level of uncertainty regarding the direct impact of this news on AAPL, I am assigning a probability reflecting the general positive market sentiment and the indirect benefit to Apple, but acknowledging that other factors could influence its stock price.  The consensus leans towards a rise, but not overwhelmingly so. I'm adjusting slightly downwards from previous estimates that place higher weights on the indirect relation between general market rise and AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a strong performance in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office, with a focus on the technology sector and comparisons between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Magnificent Seven and benefits from general market optimism. However, the article lacks specific details about Apple's performance. The positive sentiment toward Big Tech and the overall market surge suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising. Previous predictions from other models generally lean toward a moderate to high probability of a rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Considering this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the positive market environment, but with some uncertainty due to the lack of company-specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge driven by President Trump's return to office, describing the best start to a presidential term since 1985. It also mentions that Big Tech is considered a 'market to own until proven otherwise.' Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant player in the Big Tech sector and is part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' a successor to FANG. While the article does not provide specific information about Apple's performance or outlook, the overall positive market sentiment and the favorable view of Big Tech stocks suggest a likely positive impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling, but with consideration of the general nature of the news and lack of company-specific details.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, with a positive sentiment towards Big Tech, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the article does not provide specific information about Apple's performance or prospects, the overall market trend and the mention of Big Tech as a 'market to own until proven otherwise' suggest a positive sentiment that could benefit Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising, and taking into account the general nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strong surge in US equity markets during President Trump's return to office, with a focus on the overall positive market sentiment. Although Apple Inc. is not explicitly mentioned in the headline, it is considered part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which includes leading tech companies. Moreover, the article emphasizes the 'Why Big Tech is a market to own until proven otherwise' sentiment, suggesting positive expectations for Big Tech, including Apple. The broader market surge, particularly in FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, generally has a positive impact on tech giants like Apple. However, since the news lacks specific details about Apple\u2019s performance or outlook, the impact on Apple's stock price is somewhat indirect.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office, creating a positive overall market sentiment. Although Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned, it is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' which generally suggests a strong alignment with positive tech market trends. Previous predictions indicate a moderate to high probability of a price increase due to the overall favorable conditions surrounding Big Tech stocks. The analysis shows that, while there is significant uncertainty due to the lack of direct information regarding Apple, the broader market positivity implies a higher likelihood of price rises for Apple. Therefore, this leads to a probability estimate that favors increases in stock price while acknowledging the potential for a fall is still present.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news highlights a strong market surge linked to President Trump's return, which generally benefits tech stocks like Apple, a member of the 'Magnificent Seven.' The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive impact, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise. However, the lack of Apple-specific information and the slight downward adjustments in some prior estimates indicate some reservations. Therefore, estimating a slightly lower probability of a rise, while maintaining a preference towards increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news reports a broad market surge fueled by positive sentiment surrounding President Trump's return. While Apple isn't directly mentioned, its inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' and the positive outlook on Big Tech suggest a likely positive correlation.  However, the lack of Apple-specific details weakens the direct causal link.  Analyzing the preceding predictions, there's a trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, with values clustering between 0.6 and 0.7.  Considering this consensus and the indirect positive influence of the overall market surge, I'm assigning a probability that reflects a moderate likelihood of a price increase, acknowledging potential unforeseen factors that could impact the stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, with a focus on the performance of FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The general positive sentiment towards Big Tech, described as a 'market to own until proven otherwise,' suggests a favorable environment for Apple. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple's performance, the overall market optimism and Apple's inclusion in the Magnificent Seven imply a likely positive impact on its stock price. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a moderate to high probability of a stock price rise, averaging around 0.6 to 0.7. Therefore, considering the indirect positive impact of the market surge and Big Tech sentiment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a strong surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office, with a focus on the technology sector and comparisons between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Magnificent Seven and likely benefits from the overall positive market trends associated with big tech stocks. The emphasis on favorable conditions for technology stocks and the positive sentiment towards Big Tech increase the likelihood of Apple's share price rising. Previous predictions from various models generally lean towards a moderate to high probability of a rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Considering this positive market environment and the indirect benefit to Apple, I estimate a moderately high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses a broad market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, with a focus on the technology sector and comparisons between FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Magnificent Seven and benefits from general market optimism. The positive sentiment towards Big Tech, as mentioned in the article 'Why Big Tech is a market to own until proven otherwise,' suggests a favorable view of tech stocks like Apple. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising, and taking into account the general nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. The lack of company-specific news introduces some uncertainty, but the overall market trend and sector sentiment support a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strong surge in US equity markets during President Trump's return to office, with a particular focus on the technology sector and the concept of 'FANG' stocks. Apple Inc., being a significant component of the 'Magnificent Seven', is likely to benefit from the overall positive market sentiment. The emphasis on the 'Why Big Tech is a market to own until proven otherwise' sentiment further supports a positive outlook for tech stocks.
