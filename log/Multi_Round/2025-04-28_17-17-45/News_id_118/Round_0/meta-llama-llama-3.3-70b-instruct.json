However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market.

But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

This move is seen as a strategic effort to gain an advantage in the market. However, the article does not directly mention any significant impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The mention of AAPL is only in the context of TikTok's absence from Apple's app store. Given this indirect connection, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Nevertheless, if the ban on TikTok were to happen, it could potentially lead to increased usage of other social media platforms, including those available on Apple devices, which might have a slightly positive effect on AAPL. However, this effect is expected to be minimal and indirect.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
