(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\nNews Content: Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote its platform Instagram, which could impact competition in the digital advertising space. While this could generate additional pressure on TikTok, it does not directly affect Apple's core business or stock pricing in a significant manner. The reported cash deals for creators may enhance Meta's platform's visibility, potentially affecting Apple's stock indirectly through competition in ad revenues. Overall, Apple may see a minor downward impact due to competition, but the influence of this news specifically on AAPL's stock price is likely limited. Hence, the probabilities reflect more stability or a slight decline than a rise in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Meta's aggressive attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban could negatively affect TikTok's market position which may indirectly benefit Apple as it is a platform which host TikTok. Also, Trump's influence advocating for TikTok could lead to a delay in the ban, creating uncertainty and potential downward pressure on Meta's strategy of leveraging the ban's uncertainty for its competition plan. Finally, the stock price is down premarket, suggesting some initial worry over Meta competing with TikTok, thus no immediate worries over app platforms. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minor as the primary players are TikTok, Meta and Google. The news mainly focuses on the implications for social media competition and Meta's strategies more directly. Therefore, the probability changes is more uncertain for AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's actions to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban. While this might indirectly benefit Instagram, the impact on Apple is negligible.  The article mentions Apple only in the context of TikTok's absence from its app store.  There's no direct connection between Meta's actions and Apple's financial performance, stock valuation, or future prospects. The news primarily affects Meta's stock. Therefore, the likelihood of Apple's stock price movement being influenced by this news is extremely low. Any change would likely be due to broader market factors, not this specific event. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta Platforms Inc's strategy to leverage the potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, offering cash deals to creators. While the news discusses Apple Inc (AAPL) in the context of TikTok's absence from its app store, it does not directly impact Apple's core business or financial performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's efforts to promote Instagram by leveraging the potential ban of TikTok, offering cash deals to creators to shift their content to Instagram Reels. This move is likely to benefit Meta (META) at the expense of TikTok. However, the article does not directly impact Apple's (AAPL) stock price, as Apple is only mentioned as one of the companies that removed TikTok from its app store. The news is more relevant to Meta and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, and potentially negative for TikTok. Given that the news does not provide a direct catalyst for Apple's stock price movement, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news as relatively low. The current market sentiment and Apple's stock performance are more likely to be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the article.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's attempt to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote Instagram on other social media platforms. This move is seen as a strategic effort to gain an advantage in the market. However, the article does not directly mention any significant impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The mention of AAPL is only in the context of TikTok's absence from Apple's app store. Given this indirect connection, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Nevertheless, if the ban on TikTok were to happen, it could potentially lead to increased usage of other social media platforms, including those available on Apple devices, which might have a slightly positive effect on AAPL. However, this effect is expected to be minimal and indirect.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Meta Platforms' efforts to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote Instagram. This initiative could potentially lead to increased usage of Instagram and thus, higher revenues for Meta Platforms. However, the news highlights a cash incentive program which could be seen as a short-term cost increase for Meta, thereby impacting profitability. Additionally, the broader impact on AAPL's stock is less clear since the story mainly revolves around Meta and TikTok interactions with AAPL services.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Meta's strategy to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban and promote Instagram, with minimal direct implications for Apple Inc. Apple is mentioned only in the context of TikTok's absence from its app store. The effects of this news on Apple's stock price appear to be limited, as it mainly pertains to competition in the social media space rather than directly impacting Apple's core business. Previous predictions indicate a general uncertainty regarding Apple's stock movement due to this news, with a tendency towards a slight negative outlook due to increased competition. Overall, I assess that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising as the sentiment remains more cautious.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's strategy to capitalize on potential TikTok ban, primarily benefiting Meta and potentially impacting TikTok negatively. Apple is mentioned only tangentially as a platform that distributes the involved apps. The link between Meta's actions and Apple's core business is weak. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds and the lack of direct impact identified in the news, any effect on Apple's stock is more likely driven by overall market sentiment than this specific news. I'll slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect this neutrality with other participants showing more negative views overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban. This is primarily a Meta story and has only a very indirect and tenuous relationship to Apple.  While a TikTok ban *might* lead to increased use of other platforms (including Instagram, available on Apple devices), this effect is likely to be small and heavily diluted by other market factors. Apple's inclusion in the article is minor\u2014it merely notes TikTok's absence from the Apple App Store. The pre-market decline in META and the previous predictions showing a very low probability of AAPL price movement reinforce this assessment.  There's no significant direct impact on Apple's financials or business strategy presented in the news. Therefore, the probability of a price change in either direction for AAPL due to this news is extremely low, with the probability of no change far outweighing either a rise or a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta Platforms' strategy to leverage the potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The mention of AAPL is only contextual, relating to TikTok's absence from Apple's app store. Given the indirect connection and lack of direct financial or operational impact on Apple, the news is unlikely to significantly influence AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions also suggest minimal impact, with most models estimating low probabilities of movement. Therefore, the stock price is expected to remain relatively stable with no strong directional bias.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Meta's strategy to promote Instagram by leveraging the potential ban of TikTok, offering cash deals to creators. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned only in the context of TikTok's absence from its app store. There is no direct connection between Meta's actions and Apple's financial performance, stock valuation, or future prospects. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect. Given the information and the reactions of others, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to indirect competitive pressures in the digital advertising space, but overall, the probabilities reflect more stability than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote its platform Instagram, which could generate additional pressure on TikTok but does not directly affect Apple's core business or stock pricing in a significant manner. The impact on Apple is likely to be minor as the primary players are TikTok, Meta, and Google. The news mainly affects Meta's stock, and any change in Apple's stock price would likely be due to broader market factors, not this specific event.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Meta's efforts to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote Instagram. This initiative could potentially lead to increased usage of Instagram and thus, higher revenues for Meta Platforms. The news also involves Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of the absence of TikTok from its app store. However, it does not directly impact Apple's core business or financial performance. The overall market reaction suggests a slight downward pressure on Meta's strategy implementation, and the news may have minimal indirect effects on AAPL due to competition dynamics in the digital advertising space.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news largely pertains to Meta's strategy in response to the potential TikTok ban and its implications for Instagram. While Apple is mentioned as a platform that removed TikTok, the direct impact on its business is minimal. Analysts have indicated that the connection between Meta's actions and Apple's stock movement is weak, with probabilities leaning towards stability or slight decline due to competitive pressures but not a direct financial impact. Overall sentiment leans slightly negative, leaning toward a probability of decline in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, primarily benefiting Meta. Apple is only mentioned as one of the platforms TikTok is absent from its app store. Many previous models have indicated a limited direct impact on Apple's business, noting that broader market trends are more likely to influence AAPL stock. However, most models predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising indicating that news may have minimal indirect effects on AAPL due to competition dynamics in the digital advertising space, while the others give a balanced probability. Overall with the more trend pointing to the negative side and the previous predictions trend, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban by aggressively promoting Instagram.  While this could indirectly impact Apple through increased competition in the digital advertising market and the potential shift in user engagement from TikTok to Instagram, the connection is weak. Apple is only mentioned in relation to the absence of TikTok from its app store, indicating no direct effect on Apple's operations or financials. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a slight negative or neutral impact on AAPL's stock price due to the indirect and limited nature of the news's relevance to Apple. The pre-market decline in META also suggests market participants are viewing this news as having more of an effect on Meta than Apple. Considering the indirect nature of the relationship, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, with a slightly higher chance of a minor decline than a rise due to the competitive pressures exerted by Meta's actions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage the potential TikTok ban to promote Instagram, offering cash deals to creators. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned only in the context of TikTok's absence from its app store. There is no direct connection between Meta's actions and Apple's financial performance, stock valuation, or future prospects. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect. Given the information and the reactions of others, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to indirect competitive pressures in the digital advertising space, but overall, the probabilities reflect more stability than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote Instagram, offering cash deals to creators.

Apple is mentioned only in the context of TikTok's absence from its app store. Given the indirect connection and lack of direct financial or operational impact on Apple, the news is unlikely to significantly influence AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions also suggest minimal impact, with most models estimating low probabilities of movement. However, the overall market reaction and competitive dynamics in the digital advertising space may lead to a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price due to increased competition.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Meta's efforts to leverage the potential ban of TikTok to promote Instagram.

(AAPL) only in the context of the absence of TikTok from its app store. However, it does not directly impact Apple's core business or financial performance.
