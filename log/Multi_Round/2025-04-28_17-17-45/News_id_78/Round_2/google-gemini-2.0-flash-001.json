(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment and ongoing share repurchase program, which have historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation by reducing share count and increasing EPS. However, there are concerns about stagnating sales of physical products and a high P/E ratio indicating potential overvaluation. While the ongoing buybacks and services growth could provide upward momentum, the stagnant product sales and high valuation create caution among investors. Therefore, the likelihood of a stock price rise is moderate, but the potential for a fall exists due to concerns about product performance and market valuation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the massive share buyback program has significantly boosted EPS and signals management confidence, slowing product sales and a historically high P/E ratio introduce concerns. Warren Buffett's reduced stake further raises a red flag. The article also highlights Apple's investment in AI. Overall, the positive effects of the buyback program are potentially offset by valuation concerns and slowing product sales, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The double down recommendation may only be a tactic to get more views to help promote The Motley Fool. The recommendation also does not have sufficient supporting data or reasoning.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock buyback program as a key driver of its EPS growth. While this is positive, the article also points out significant concerns:  stalled physical product sales for two years, despite the iPhone's continued dominance in the US;  a historically high P/E ratio over 42; and Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple.  These negative factors outweigh the positive impact of the buybacks, especially given the current high valuation. The overall market's current upward trend due to AI and other factors is mentioned but doesn't directly address Apple's specific challenges. The buybacks may offer some support, but the fundamental issues suggest a higher chance of price correction than continued substantial growth. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed as higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant investment in share buybacks, which has contributed to its EPS growth and reduced share count, making the stock more attractive. However, concerns are raised about stagnant physical product sales and the stock's historically high valuation. The positive aspects of the buyback program may outweigh the negatives, but the stock's high P/E ratio and stagnant sales could limit upward movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's significant investment of $725 billion in stock repurchases over 11 years, which has reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% and increased its EPS. However, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's physical product sales stalling and its historically high P/E ratio of over 42. Despite the positive impact of share buybacks on EPS, the stock's valuation and stagnant product sales are potential drawbacks. Overall, the article presents a mixed view of Apple's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's $725 billion investment in share repurchases, which has contributed to the company's growth in earnings per share (EPS). However, it also mentions that Apple's physical product sales have stalled, and the stock is currently overvalued with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of over 42. Additionally, billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, indicating potential concerns about the company's valuation. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's significant stock repurchase program and its impact on EPS, but also points out concerns about the stagnation in physical product sales and the historically high P/E ratio. These mixed signals present both positive and negative indicators for the stock's potential movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment in stock buybacks, which have historically bolstered its EPS and share value by reducing share count. This demonstrates management's confidence in the company's future. However, concerns over stagnant physical product sales and a high P/E ratio of over 42 suggest potential overvaluation. The mixed signals of significant buyback benefits against fundamental performance issues lead to cautious optimism. Based on these factors, there appears to be a moderate likelihood of price increase balanced against the significant probability of a price decrease due to valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple's stock. The massive buyback program is a significant positive, reducing share count and boosting EPS. The continued growth of the Services segment and Apple's presence in AI also contribute positively. However, stagnating physical product sales, a historically high P/E ratio, and Warren Buffett's reduced stake raise serious concerns. The previous round of predictions shows a slight downward trend, mainly driven by concerns about valuation and product sales. While the buybacks provide some support, the headwinds seem stronger. Considering these factors, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The massive stock buyback program is a strong positive, demonstrably boosting EPS and signaling management confidence. However, this is counterbalanced by significant concerns:  two years of stagnant physical product sales (despite iPhone market leadership), a historically high P/E ratio exceeding 42, and Warren Buffett's significant stake reduction.  These factors suggest a potential overvaluation and a risk of price correction. While the buybacks might offer some support, the fundamental issues regarding product sales and valuation are substantial. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the consensus leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the current market sentiment (influenced by AI, etc.), a significant upward movement seems less likely despite the positive EPS impact from buybacks.  Therefore, I'm weighting the negative factors more heavily than the positive ones.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's financial prospects. On the positive side, Apple's substantial $725 billion investment in share repurchases has significantly reduced its outstanding share count, boosting EPS and making the stock more attractive. The company's strong balance sheet and consistent growth in its Services segment also support a positive outlook. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple introduce significant caution. These negative factors, coupled with the current high valuation, suggest that the stock may face downward pressure. While the buyback program provides some support, the overall assessment leans slightly more towards the probability of a stock price fall given the valuation and product sales concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment in its stock buyback program, which has historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation by reducing share count and increasing EPS. However, concerns about stagnating physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 suggest potential overvaluation and limit the stock's upside potential. The mixed signals present a scenario where the stock's potential for growth is countered by its high valuation and slowing product sales. Considering these factors, there is a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to the ongoing buyback program and services growth, but a significant likelihood of a fall due to product performance issues and market valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment in stock repurchases, which has contributed to the company's growth in earnings per share (EPS). However, it also mentions concerns about Apple's physical product sales stalling and the stock being overvalued with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of over 42. Additionally, billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, indicating potential concerns about the company's valuation. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The ongoing share repurchase program and growth in services may provide some support to the stock price, but the stagnation in product sales and high valuation introduce significant caution. Thus, the probabilities are estimated based on a balanced view of these factors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's substantial $725 billion investment in share repurchases and ongoing services growth, which have historically been beneficial for stock price appreciation. However, concerns about stagnating physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio remain significant. While the buyback programs and ongoing service growth provide some upward momentum, the mixed signals from both positive and negative indicators suggest that the overall probability of a stock price rise is moderate.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
