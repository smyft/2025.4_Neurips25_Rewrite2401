(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Tumble 4% After Double Downgrades by Analysts\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financial) shares tumbled more than 4% on Tuesday after analysts across the board downgraded the stock, citing mounting worries about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services.\n\nApple was downgraded to underperform from hold by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. However, Lee said the downgrade reflected weakening demand for the iPhone, particularly in major foreign markets such as China. However, efforts to boost sales with new models, such as the budget-friendly iPhone SE, have not really gotten buy-in in an increasingly crowded smartphone market, which has raised doubts about revenue growth.\n\nLast week, Barclays also downgraded Apple to an underweight from an equal weight rating, warning of poor iPhone 15 sales and anticipating more of the same with the iPhone 16. It also long condemned Apple's product lineup as not innovative enough, which, he said, had dulled consumer interest and buying momentum.\n\nApple's hardware business, of course, extends beyond smartphones, and it also has headwinds. Declining sales of MacBooks and iPads were also a long pointer to bigger problems in the company's hardware arm, a historically lucrative revenue generator.\n\nGrowing skepticism of Apple's ability to keep its growth well intact in the face of changing market conditions led to these downgrades. Meanwhile, analysts remain wary of Apple's near-term performance as it grapples with intensifying competition and economic pressures, a selling factor in recent weakness.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment surrounding Apple's stock due to downgrades by multiple analysts, who cite concerns about declining iPhone sales and issues in the hardware sector. The downgrades reflect a growing skepticism regarding Apple's growth prospects, particularly in competitive markets. Following such downgrades and negative outlooks, it is reasonable to anticipate that investor sentiment will lead to further selling pressure, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline rather than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two major downgrades from respected analyst firms (Jefferies and Barclays) citing concerns about iPhone sales (both current and future models), lack of innovation, weakening demand in key markets like China, and declining sales of MacBooks and iPads. The consensus seems to be growing skepticism about Apple's ability to maintain growth. While there might be some brief periods of upward movement due to bargain hunters, the medium-term effect is likely to be bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment towards Apple's stock. Two major analysts, Jefferies and Barclays, have downgraded Apple's rating, citing weakening iPhone sales, particularly in China, lack of innovation in its product lineup, and declining sales of MacBooks and iPads.  These downgrades, coupled with the 4% immediate price drop, suggest a bearish outlook. While Apple's services sector could provide some resilience, the overall picture painted by the analysts points towards continued near-term weakness.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a further price fall is significantly higher, albeit with some uncertainty due to potential market reactions and unforeseen factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns about Apple's performance, including downgrades by major analysts, weakening iPhone demand, lackluster hardware and services performance, and increasing competition. These factors suggest a negative outlook for Apple's stock in the near term. The 4% drop in stock price following the downgrades indicates strong market reaction to the negative sentiment. Given the bearish analyst reports and the cited challenges, the probability of further decline is higher than a rebound in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple's stock due to double downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and increasing competition. These downgrades and the cited reasons suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling as investors react to the downgraded expectations and weakening demand for Apple's products.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price has already tumbled 4% after double downgrades by analysts, citing concerns about sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and intensifying competition. The downgrades and negative analyst comments suggest a bearish outlook for the company's near-term performance. Additionally, the article mentions declining sales of MacBooks and iPads, which adds to the concerns about the company's hardware business. Based on this information, it is likely that the stock price will continue to fall in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news reports significant negative factors, including multiple downgrades by financial analysts due to concerns about declining iPhone sales and other hardware products. The analysts also highlight weak performance in services, market competition, and challenging economic conditions. These factors indicate a pessimistic outlook for Apple's near-term performance. Given the context, it is likely that the stock price will continue to be affected negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative sentiment toward Apple's stock due to multiple downgrades by analysts citing declining iPhone sales, lackluster hardware performance, and increasing competition. The immediate reaction of a 4% drop in the stock price reflects strong market concerns regarding Apple's growth prospects. Given the bearish outlook shared by respected analysts and the emphasis on waning consumer interest and sales problems, it is reasonable to expect that investor sentiment will continue to favor selling over buying. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative, with double downgrades from major analysts citing concerns about iPhone sales (current and future models), lack of innovation, weakening demand in key markets like China, and declining sales of MacBooks and iPads. The recent 4% drop confirms the market's negative sentiment. While a small rebound is possible, the trend indicated by the news suggests further price decline. Previous predictions also lean heavily towards a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative, with multiple analysts downgrading Apple due to concerns about declining iPhone sales, lack of innovation, and weakening performance across hardware and services.  The 4% immediate drop reflects the market's initial reaction to this negative sentiment. While there's always the potential for a short-term bounce or bargain buying, the consistent negative assessments from respected analysts suggest a prolonged period of bearish pressure. The previous predictions from various models (ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 probability of a price rise and 0.7 to 0.9 probability of a price fall) further reinforce this negative outlook.  Considering the weight of evidence and the market\u2019s immediate reaction, the probability of a further price decline is significantly higher than a price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant negative sentiment towards Apple's stock, driven by double downgrades from analysts at Jefferies and Barclays. The downgrades cite concerns about declining iPhone sales, particularly in key markets like China, lack of innovation in the product lineup, and weakening performance in hardware and services. The immediate 4% drop in stock price reflects strong market reaction to these downgrades. Given the bearish outlook from analysts, the increasing competition, and the economic pressures mentioned, the probability of further decline in the stock price is higher than a potential rise in the near term. While there might be some minor upward movements due to bargain hunting, the overall sentiment and analyst consensus suggest continued downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news reports that Apple's stock price has tumbled 4% after double downgrades by analysts, citing concerns about sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and intensifying competition. Multiple analysts have expressed skepticism about Apple's growth prospects, particularly in competitive markets such as China. The downgrades and negative analyst comments suggest a bearish outlook for the company's near-term performance. Given this context, it is likely that the stock price will continue to be affected negatively. The consensus among various predictions is that the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news article reports a significant negative sentiment surrounding Apple's stock due to double downgrades by analysts, citing concerns about sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and intensifying competition.

Following such downgrades and negative outlooks, it is reasonable to anticipate that investor sentiment will lead to further selling pressure, resulting in a higher probability of stock price decline rather than an increase. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a strong bearish outlook, with probabilities of stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.9. Considering this information, I estimate a low probability of stock price rise and a high probability of stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and significant concerns regarding Apple's performance, specifically citing issues with iPhone sales, lack of innovation, and declines in hardware sales such as MacBooks and iPads. The market response has been immediate, with a 4% tumble. Several predictions from different models show a strong consensus that the stock price is likely to fall further due to the negative sentiment and analyst downgrades. The combination of consistent negative sentiment, ongoing competitive pressures, and market reactions strongly supports the notion that the stock price is more likely to fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
