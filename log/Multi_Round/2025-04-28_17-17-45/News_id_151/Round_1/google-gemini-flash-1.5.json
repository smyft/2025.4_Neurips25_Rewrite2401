Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which could create uncertainty in corporate policies, including at Apple. However, Apple's commitment to DEI and the potential for shareholder support suggests a robust stance that could mitigate negative impacts on its stock price. Overall, while there may be some concerns leading to a slight chance of decline, the existing commitment to diversity initiatives may bolster investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of price stability or increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance to this initiative from corporations like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and potentially Apple. While the headline suggests a potential negative impact due to the political dimension, the resistance from major corporations suggests a possible long-term stability factor. The conflict between political pressure and commitment from large institutions creates uncertainty. Since Apple faces a similar DEI vote in February, and given the focus on corporate resistance, the market will likely perceive Apple's stance on DEI may create conflict from both sides, either socially or politically. There could be reputational considerations and impact on potential employees. Therefore, the news can be viewed as a slight net neutral factor but might lead to a slight decline in stock price or trading sideways, given the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back DEI programs, facing resistance from major corporations.  Apple is mentioned specifically as having a shareholder vote on DEI policies coming up in February. While Trump's actions could potentially create some negative sentiment around DEI-focused companies in the short-term, the article highlights that many companies like Apple are pushing back.  The long-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The shareholder vote itself introduces uncertainty, but the pre-existing positive sentiment around Apple, based on its overall financial health and product demand, is likely to outweigh any negative impact from this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly favored, as companies standing firm on their values can be viewed positively by many investors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses political and social initiatives (DEI programs) rather than direct financial or operational impacts on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While political and social stances can influence investor sentiment, Apple's stock price is more likely to be driven by its financial performance, product innovations, and market conditions. The news mentions Apple facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies, but this is not expected to have an immediate or significant impact on the stock price. Given the lack of direct financial implications, the probabilities of a rise or fall are balanced but skewed slightly towards no major movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which could potentially impact companies that have strong DEI values. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as facing a similar vote in February regarding its diversity policies. However, the overall sentiment of the article seems neutral to slightly positive towards companies standing firm on their DEI values. Given that Apple is known for its strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, the potential backlash against Trump's initiative might not significantly negatively impact Apple's stock price. Instead, Apple's commitment to DEI could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that President Trump is targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The fact that Apple faces a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies suggests that the company is committed to its values. Additionally, data from Citigroup shows that discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, which could be seen as a positive for companies that prioritize DEI. However, the news does not have a direct impact on Apple's financials, and the market reaction may be muted. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive sentiment towards companies that prioritize DEI, but the overall impact is likely to be small.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on DEI programs by President Trump, which could impact various corporations. While some companies, including Apple, are facing shareholder votes on defending diversity policies, the core business operations and profitability of Apple are not directly impacted by such political shifts. Additionally, the backing of DEI values by major companies suggests that there is considerable support within corporate America. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

However, Apple's upcoming shareholder vote and the overall corporate resistance to Trump's efforts suggest a relatively strong position.  The previous predictions range widely (0.4 to 0.6 for both rise and fall), indicating significant uncertainty.  While the news doesn't directly affect Apple's financials, the potential for negative investor sentiment related to DEI is present, counterbalanced by Apple's reputation and apparent commitment to DEI.  Given this uncertainty, and the significant weight given to other factors impacting Apple's stock price (financial results, product releases, macroeconomic conditions), I believe the impact of this particular news will be relatively minor. The probabilities are therefore weighted slightly towards no change, reflecting the balancing act between potential negative sentiment and the overall positive sentiment toward Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.48,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.52\n}\n```\n"
