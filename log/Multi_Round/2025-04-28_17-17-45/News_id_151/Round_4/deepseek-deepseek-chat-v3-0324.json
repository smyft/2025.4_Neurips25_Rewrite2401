(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which could create uncertainty in corporate policies, including at Apple. However, Apple's commitment to DEI and the potential for shareholder support suggests a robust stance that could mitigate negative impacts on its stock price. Overall, while there may be some concerns leading to a slight chance of decline, the existing commitment to diversity initiatives may bolster investor confidence, resulting in a higher probability of price stability or increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance to this initiative from corporations like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and potentially Apple. While the headline suggests a potential negative impact due to the political dimension, the resistance from major corporations suggests a possible long-term stability factor. The conflict between political pressure and commitment from large institutions creates uncertainty. Since Apple faces a similar DEI vote in February, and given the focus on corporate resistance, the market will likely perceive Apple's stance on DEI may create conflict from both sides, either socially or politically. There could be reputational considerations and impact on potential employees. Therefore, the news can be viewed as a slight net neutral factor but might lead to a slight decline in stock price or trading sideways, given the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back DEI programs, facing resistance from major corporations.  Apple is mentioned specifically as having a shareholder vote on DEI policies coming up in February. While Trump's actions could potentially create some negative sentiment around DEI-focused companies in the short-term, the article highlights that many companies like Apple are pushing back.  The long-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The shareholder vote itself introduces uncertainty, but the pre-existing positive sentiment around Apple, based on its overall financial health and product demand, is likely to outweigh any negative impact from this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly favored, as companies standing firm on their values can be viewed positively by many investors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses political and social initiatives (DEI programs) rather than direct financial or operational impacts on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While political and social stances can influence investor sentiment, Apple's stock price is more likely to be driven by its financial performance, product innovations, and market conditions. The news mentions Apple facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies, but this is not expected to have an immediate or significant impact on the stock price. Given the lack of direct financial implications, the probabilities of a rise or fall are balanced but skewed slightly towards no major movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which could potentially impact companies that have strong DEI values. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as facing a similar vote in February regarding its diversity policies. However, the overall sentiment of the article seems neutral to slightly positive towards companies standing firm on their DEI values. Given that Apple is known for its strong commitment to diversity and inclusion, the potential backlash against Trump's initiative might not significantly negatively impact Apple's stock price. Instead, Apple's commitment to DEI could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that President Trump is targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The fact that Apple faces a similar vote in February to defend its diversity policies suggests that the company is committed to its values. Additionally, data from Citigroup shows that discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, which could be seen as a positive for companies that prioritize DEI. However, the news does not have a direct impact on Apple's financials, and the market reaction may be muted. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive sentiment towards companies that prioritize DEI, but the overall impact is likely to be small.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on DEI programs by President Trump, which could impact various corporations. While some companies, including Apple, are facing shareholder votes on defending diversity policies, the core business operations and profitability of Apple are not directly impacted by such political shifts. Additionally, the backing of DEI values by major companies suggests that there is considerable support within corporate America. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, a topic that may generate concern amongst investors regarding corporate policies. However, major companies like Apple are maintaining their commitment to DEI, which suggests resilience against potential negative sentiment. The upcoming shareholder vote in February could introduce short-term uncertainty, but overall, Apple's established positive reputation in DEI may offer support for its stock price. Given these dynamics, the probabilities are tilted slightly in favor of a price rise as investors may view Apple's position positively, amidst broader resistance from corporations against political pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The previous rounds show a slight tendency towards a positive sentiment or a neutral impact on Apple's stock price. While Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs introduces some uncertainty, companies like Apple are showing resistance, and some may even be doubling down on DEI. Given Apple's known commitment and the shareholder vote, a positive reaction to a strong pro-DEI stance is likely. Additionally, the other predictions' values generally cluster slightly above neutral, which also indicates that some positive signals behind the scene may have subtly contributed to stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag.  Trump's attack on DEI programs is potentially negative for companies seen as heavily invested in such initiatives.  However, Apple's upcoming shareholder vote and the overall corporate resistance to Trump's efforts suggest a relatively strong position.  The previous predictions range widely (0.4 to 0.6 for both rise and fall), indicating significant uncertainty.  While the news doesn't directly affect Apple's financials, the potential for negative investor sentiment related to DEI is present, counterbalanced by Apple's reputation and apparent commitment to DEI.  Given this uncertainty, and the significant weight given to other factors impacting Apple's stock price (financial results, product releases, macroeconomic conditions), I believe the impact of this particular news will be relatively minor. The probabilities are therefore weighted slightly towards no change, reflecting the balancing act between potential negative sentiment and the overall positive sentiment toward Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance from major corporations like Apple. While this introduces some political and social uncertainty, Apple's strong commitment to DEI and shareholder support suggests resilience. The news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance, and market reaction is likely to be muted. Given the overall positive sentiment towards companies maintaining DEI values, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which could create uncertainty in corporate policies, including at Apple. However, Apple's commitment to DEI and the potential for shareholder support suggests a robust stance that could mitigate negative impacts on its stock price. Other models' predictions indicate a range of opinions, from a slight decline to a potential increase, based on the perceived impact of corporate resistance to Trump's initiative and the importance of DEI values to investors. Considering these factors and the overall sentiment that companies standing firm on their DEI values might be viewed positively, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on DEI programs by President Trump, which could impact various corporations. While Apple is facing a shareholder vote on diversity policies in February, it is still a major company with a strong commitment to DEI. The news has raised concerns about the potential impact on corporate policies, creating some uncertainty. However, the backing of DEI policies by influential companies like Apple suggests substantial corporate support. This news might cause short-term volatility, but the company's robust position on DEI and financial stability are likely to minimize adverse effects on the stock price. The trend among previous predictions indicates a slight leaning towards stock price stability or increase.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which introduces some uncertainty for corporations including Apple. However, several major companies, including Apple, are resisting this initiative, which suggests a potentially positive response from investors who favor corporate social responsibility. The upcoming shareholder vote on DEI policies in February adds a layer of uncertainty, but Apple's strong established commitment to diversity initiatives may mitigate negative sentiments. Previous predictions indicate a slight leaning towards price stability or an increase in stock value. Given these factors, my assessment indicates a somewhat higher probability of the stock price rising in light of Apple's resilience and commitment to DEI values amidst the political backdrop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses Trump's initiative against DEI programs and corporate resistance, including Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on the issue. While the political environment introduces some uncertainty, Apple's established commitment to DEI and the resistance from other corporations support a more bullish perspective. The previous predictions vacillate but show a slight tendency towards a positive outlook, indicating underlying support. Considering the mixed signals but weighting it towards corporate resistance offsetting political pressure, the stock is slightly more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a complex scenario.  Trump's attack on DEI programs is a potential negative, especially for companies strongly associated with such initiatives. However, Apple's commitment to DEI, evidenced by the upcoming shareholder vote in February and the overall corporate resistance highlighted in the article, suggests significant resilience.  The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating significant market uncertainty regarding the impact of this news. While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's financials, the potential for negative investor sentiment related to DEI exists. This is balanced by Apple's strong brand, financial health, and apparent commitment to its DEI policies, which could be viewed positively by many investors.  The consensus of prior models leans slightly towards a price increase, but the uncertainty is substantial enough to suggest a relatively neutral overall impact from this specific news.  Therefore, a probability near 0.5 for both rise and fall reflects this balancing act and acknowledges the influence of other significant factors affecting Apple's stock price, such as financial performance and product releases.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which introduces political and social uncertainty. However, major corporations like Apple are resisting this initiative, which could be viewed positively by investors who value corporate social responsibility. Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies adds short-term uncertainty, but the company's strong commitment to DEI and financial stability are likely to mitigate any significant negative impact. Previous predictions from other models show a slight tendency towards a positive or neutral impact, suggesting that the market may not react strongly to this news. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which could create uncertainty in corporate policies, including at Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple's commitment to DEI and the potential for shareholder support suggest a robust stance that could mitigate negative impacts on its stock price. The previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, but generally indicate a slight leaning towards a positive sentiment or neutral impact on Apple's stock price. Given Apple's strong commitment to DEI and the backing of DEI values by major companies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which could create uncertainty in corporate policies, including at Apple. However, Apple's commitment to DEI and the potential for shareholder support suggests a robust stance that could mitigate negative impacts on its stock price. Considering the overall sentiment that companies standing firm on their DEI values might be viewed positively, and the trend among previous predictions indicating a slight leaning towards stock price stability or increase, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. The analysis of previous models shows a range of opinions, but most lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price due to its strong commitment to DEI and the backing of DEI policies by influential companies.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on DEI programs by President Trump, creating uncertainty in corporate policies. Companies like Apple, with strong DEI commitments, may face temporary concerns but are ultimately expected to withstand the potential negative sentiment. There's a balancing act between short-term uncertainty caused by political shifts and the positive sentiment towards companies maintaining DEI values. Previous predictions from various models suggest a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple\u2019s stock price despite the news. The company\u2019s robust position on DEI and financial stability are likely to minimize adverse effects on the stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which introduces some uncertainty for corporations, including Apple. However, several large companies, including Apple, are actively resisting this initiative, suggesting investors may favor corporate social responsibility. The upcoming shareholder vote on DEI policies in February adds a layer of uncertainty but also indicates a commitment to these values. Previous predictions indicate a slight leaning towards stock price stability or increase due to Apple's established reputation and commitment to DEI. Overall, the sentiment is mixed but slightly favors a price rise given the trends in previous predictions and Apple's strong brand.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses Trump's initiative against DEI programs and how companies like Apple are resisting. While there's political uncertainty, Apple's established DEI commitment and shareholder vote suggest resilience and potential positive investor sentiment. Previous predictions show a slight upward trend. Apple's financial stability and brand further mitigate negative impacts. I'm slightly increasing my estimate for a stock price rise based on these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed signal. Trump's attack on DEI programs is a potential negative for companies with strong DEI commitments like Apple. However, Apple's demonstrable dedication to DEI, evidenced by the upcoming shareholder vote and broader corporate resistance, suggests resilience.  The previous predictions show significant variation, highlighting market uncertainty. While the news has no direct financial impact, potential negative investor sentiment related to DEI is counterbalanced by Apple's brand strength, financial health, and commitment to DEI.  The consensus among previous models leans slightly toward a price increase, but the uncertainty is high.  Therefore, a near-neutral probability reflects the balancing act between potential negative sentiment and other factors affecting Apple\u2019s stock price (financial performance, product releases, macroeconomic conditions).  The iterative predictions show a slight upward trend in the probability of a price increase, suggesting that the market may be slightly more optimistic about Apple's ability to weather this political headwind.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which introduces political and social uncertainty, particularly for companies like Apple that are committed to DEI. However, Apple's strong stance on diversity and inclusion, along with corporate resistance from major companies, suggests resilience and potential positive investor sentiment. The upcoming shareholder vote on DEI policies in February adds short-term uncertainty, but Apple's financial stability and reputation are likely to mitigate significant negative impacts. Previous predictions from various models indicate a slight leaning towards a neutral to positive impact on Apple's stock price, reflecting the balancing act between political uncertainty and corporate commitment to DEI. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs, which introduces uncertainty for corporations like Apple. However, Apple's commitment to DEI and the upcoming shareholder vote in February suggest a robust stance that could mitigate negative impacts on its stock price. The trend among previous predictions indicates a slight leaning towards stock price stability or increase, with many models suggesting that Apple's strong commitment to DEI and corporate resistance to Trump's initiative could be viewed positively by investors.
