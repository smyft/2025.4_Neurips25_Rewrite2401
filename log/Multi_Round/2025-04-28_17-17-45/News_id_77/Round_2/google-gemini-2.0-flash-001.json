(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's current performance in the market shows a decline of roughly 8% in 2025, suggesting existing bearish sentiment. While there is anticipation surrounding the earnings report, analysts have maintained a consensus EPS estimate that reflects only minimal growth, with some top-line metrics trending negatively. Key metrics to watch, such as China sales, suggest a possible stabilization, but overall sentiment and the Zacks Rank of #4 indicates a prevailing bearish outlook. Therefore, the probabilities for the stock price movement favor a fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While analysts expect EPS and revenue growth, concerns remain about China revenue and the success of 'Apple Intelligence'. The stock's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment. Currently, Apple stocks have already experienced a near 8% fall. The article highlights key metrics to watch during the earnings call: China sales, Services revenue, and iPhone sales influenced by 'Apple Intelligence'. Positive surprises in these areas could boost the stock, while disappointments could further depress it. Taking these factors into account, there is a higher probability for a stock price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company's Services segment shows strong growth, and China sales are projected to increase year-over-year for the first time in several quarters, several factors suggest caution.  The stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts.  Concerns remain regarding Apple's overall growth, particularly in China where performance has lagged.  The success of Apple Intelligence is also uncertain and will heavily influence post-earnings stock movement. Given these mixed signals and the already negative performance of the stock in 2025, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report, noting that the stock has underperformed in 2025, with an 8% decline year-to-date. Key concerns include stagnant top-line growth, challenges in China, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Analysts' EPS estimates suggest modest year-over-year growth, but revisions have been largely unchanged or slightly negative. The Services segment remains strong, but China's performance and iPhone sales are critical uncertainties. Given the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and mixed signals (potential recovery in China vs. overall growth cooling), the market may react cautiously.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. The article highlights that Apple's stock has had a rough start to 2025, down 8%, and is currently ranked #4 (Sell) by Zacks. While the earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, there are key metrics to watch such as China results, Services segment momentum, and iPhone sales, particularly related to Apple Intelligence. Given the bearish analyst sentiment and the stock's recent underperformance, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling unless the earnings report and guidance significantly exceed expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. The article highlights the importance of keeping an eye on Apple's China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the bearishness among analysts, as reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the lack of significant positive revisions, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the forecasted positive year-over-year change in China sales and the growth in the Services segment could provide some support to the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the stagnation in top-line growth and a decline in China sales indicate negative market expectations. However, potential improvements in Apple's services revenue and iPhone sales, coupled with the optimistic Zacks Consensus Estimate for China, could provide upside surprises. Given the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) classification and the need for positive commentary post-earnings, there is a slight tilt towards caution, impacting the stock price more negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. Despite a 8% decline in shares for 2025 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment, there are expectations for modest year-over-year growth in EPS and potential positive changes in China sales and Services revenue. However, concerns about stagnant growth and skepticism surrounding the iPhone and Apple Intelligence introduce caution. Given these factors, the overall probability leans towards a price decline, while any positive surprises could mitigate this risk.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The existing sentiment toward Apple is bearish, reflected in the prior round's predictions and the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The stock's underperformance in 2025 (down 8%) further reinforces this viewpoint. While a potential recovery in China sales and strong performance from the Services segment could offer some positive catalysts and potential upside surprise, the overall lukewarm earnings revisions and scepticism surrounding 'Apple Intelligence' mean investors will be cautious. A neutral earnings release is unlikely to move the needle much and any dissapointment can cause a strong bearish swing. Incorporating a slight adjustment due to the trend of earlier increased predictions, a slightly more bearish view is still warranted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment shows strong growth and China sales are projected to increase year-over-year for the first time in several quarters, several factors suggest caution. The stock's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the 8% decline year-to-date indicate bearish sentiment. Key uncertainties include the success of Apple Intelligence and the overall growth trajectory, especially in China.  Previous model predictions consistently favor a price fall, ranging from 0.58 to 0.7 probability.  Considering the mixed signals and the prevailing bearish sentiment, I slightly adjust the probability of a price fall upwards compared to the average of previous predictions, acknowledging the potential for positive surprises in the earnings report but weighing them against significant existing negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company's Services segment shows strong growth and China sales are projected to increase year-over-year for the first time in several quarters, several factors suggest caution.

Given the mixed signals and the already negative performance of the stock in 2025, there is a cautious outlook. However, potential positive surprises in China sales, Services revenue, and iPhone sales could provide some support to the stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with potential positives including forecasted growth in Services revenue and a predicted positive year-over-year change in China sales. However, the overall sentiment is cautious due to the company's stagnant top-line growth, challenges in China, and skepticism surrounding Apple Intelligence. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further indicates bearish analyst sentiment. Considering these factors and the stock's recent underperformance, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of rising. Yet, the presence of potential upside surprises means the probability of a price rise cannot be dismissed entirely.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are potential upsides such as the improved Services segment and the first positive year-over-year change in China sales after several periods of decline, the overall picture is tempered by stagnant top-line growth and the recent stock performance, reflecting bearish sentiment. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), combined with analyst concerns about Apple Intelligence and overall growth cooling, suggests that the stock is facing significant headwinds. There is a general consensus among prediction models that the stock price is more likely to fall. Positive earnings could potentially offset these bearish factors, but the probability of a significant rise seems lower based on the current mix of data points.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
