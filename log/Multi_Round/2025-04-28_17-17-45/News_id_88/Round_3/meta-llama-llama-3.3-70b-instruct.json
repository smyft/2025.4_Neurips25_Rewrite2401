(AAPL)\nNews Headline: As tech sell-off eases, what does it mean for Big Tech's AI spend?\nNews Content: Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a stabilization in tech stocks after a prior sell-off, suggesting potential recovery in the sector. The discussion around AI spending and the impact of DeepSeek's models implies a nuanced view of the future of AI investments\u2014while some firms might scale back, the overall sentiment is one of innovation and potential growth in AI-related expenditures. This could bode well for major tech companies like Apple, particularly in terms of market sentiment and demand for tech products powered by AI.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the DeepSeek AI model sparked concerns about reduced AI spending among Big Tech, potentially negatively impacting companies like Apple who are actively investing in AI. However, the analysis from T. Rowe Price's portfolio manager suggests that the DeepSeek innovation could actually *increase* compute intensity (GPU usage) in the medium term, which could *benefit* companies developing and deploying AI. The article also points out that the future of AI spending depends on the specific business models of each company. Given that Apple is a major player in AI and has significant resources, it's likely they will adapt and continue investing in AI. The \"easing\" of the tech selloff is also a positive signal. Furthermore, while the news mentions Nvidia benefiting from increasing compute needs, it is less direct and might not affect Apple's stock price as much as the immediate concerns regarding Apple's AI spending. Overall, the mixed signals create uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to the tech selloff easing, potential medium term benefits from DeepSeek, and Apple's diverse business model.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off driven by a new AI model from DeepSeek, causing concerns about Big Tech's AI spending.  However, a portfolio manager suggests that this might lead to increased compute needs in the medium term, benefiting companies like Nvidia.  The impact on Apple is less direct. While Apple is a major technology company, the news focuses on the implications for AI spending and GPU utilization, which are more directly related to chip manufacturers like Nvidia. Apple's reliance on AI is significant, but the immediate effect of the DeepSeek development is unclear. Increased compute needs could potentially benefit Apple indirectly through increased demand for its products, but this is uncertain.  The article suggests short-term consolidation is likely, making a significant price movement in either direction unlikely in the very short term. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted toward near-unchanged stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses a tech sell-off easing, with a focus on Big Tech's AI spending concerns triggered by DeepSeek AI's innovations. While initial market reaction suggested potential reductions in AI spending due to improved efficiency, the medium-term outlook remains strong as compute and GPU intensity might increase. Apple Inc. (AAPL), as a major player in Big Tech, could see mixed reactions. The recovery in chip stocks and positive medium-term outlook for AI spending may support AAPL's stock, but short-term consolidation and investor caution could limit gains. Overall, the news leans slightly positive for AAPL given the broader tech recovery and strong medium-term prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek's AI advancements on Big Tech's AI spending and the tech sector's stock performance. While the initial market reaction was negative, T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that the medium-term outlook remains strong, potentially benefiting companies like Nvidia but also implying that compute intensity could increase. Apple Inc., as a major tech player, might see its stock price influenced by these trends. Given the mixed implications of the news, with both potential short-term consolidation and medium-term growth, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the balance of these factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article suggests that the initial sell-off in tech stocks, including Apple, due to the DeepSeek AI-driven event may be easing. The commentary from T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo implies that while there might be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for Big Tech, including their spending on AI, remains strong. Rizzo's insights indicate that the increased efficiency in AI models could lead to higher compute intensity and GPU usage, potentially benefiting companies involved in AI technology, such as Nvidia. However, the impact on Apple specifically is not directly addressed in the article. Considering the general positive outlook for Big Tech's medium-term prospects and the potential for increased investment in AI technology, which could indirectly benefit Apple, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news seems slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rebound in tech stocks as the market reacts to the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek AI developments. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager suggests that while there might be short-term consolidation, the long-term outlook for investment in AI technologies remains strong.

Therefore, considering the recovering market sentiment, the focus on AI long-term benefits, and positive sentiments from an industry analyst, there's a moderate likelihood of AAPL stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight recovery in tech stocks after a prior sell-off and discusses potential implications for AI spending in relation to DeepSeek's advancements. While there are concerns about AI spending and market overconcentration, the commentary from T. Rowe Price suggests a strong medium-term outlook for AI investment, which may benefit tech companies like Apple. The overall sentiment from previous predictions leans towards a recovery in stock prices. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise, particularly in light of easing market conditions and potential benefits from AI-related innovations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple. The initial DeepSeek AI concerns triggering a tech sell-off are now easing, which is a positive signal. While there might be short-term consolidation, the medium-term outlook for AI spending remains strong, potentially benefiting companies with strong AI strategies like Apple. The portfolio manager suggests increased compute intensity, which could indirectly benefit Apple. I am also taking into account the previous rounds' predictions, especially the slight bullish sentiment that has prevailed.\n\nConsidering previously, models mostly leaned towards positive movement for Apple, I am continuing that trend but slightly reducing the probability to reflect the inherent uncertainties mentioned within the news. The range of the predictions in previous turns has been between 0.4 and 0.65 for stock prices rising. Taking the average to be about 0.525 and considering the news is indeed optimistic but with caveats, I am adjusting slightly to keep the overall trend in mind, but being a little more conservative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The initial reaction to DeepSeek's AI model was negative, impacting tech stocks broadly, including Apple. However, a portfolio manager suggests medium-term positive implications due to increased compute intensity.  The impact on Apple is indirect, unlike the clearer impact on Nvidia. Apple's diverse business isn't solely dependent on AI-related spending.  The easing of the tech sell-off provides a positive counterbalance.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range from 0.4 to 0.65 probability of a price rise, and acknowledging the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple, I'm leaning towards the more conservative estimates. The mixed signals and uncertainty lead me to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the overall easing of the sell-off and the potential medium-term benefits, but not as high as some previous predictions due to the indirect nature of the AI impact on Apple itself. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
