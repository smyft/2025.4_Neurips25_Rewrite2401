      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Nvidia Needs to Appeal to a Bigger Crowd\nNews Content: Investors are hyper-focused on data centers despite big new efforts in gaming, self-driving cars and robotics.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Nvidia and its need to appeal to a broader audience beyond data centers, highlighting challenges rather than advancements. Since this news does not directly pertain to Apple but instead focuses on Nvidia, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Market sentiment around Nvidia could indirectly affect market dynamics but does not provide a strong case for either an increase or decrease in AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to be balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Nvidia (NVDA) and its need to broaden its appeal beyond data centers. While this doesn't directly impact Apple (AAPL), the mention of areas where Nvidia is investing, such as gaming and self-driving cars, which are also areas of focus for Apple. The article highlights a potential vulnerability for Nvidia if it doesn't succeed in diversifying. If Nvidia weakens in these shared domains, it MIGHT OPEN OPPORTUNITIES for Apple. However, the impact is indirect and probably small: This article seems to have little to no impact on Apple so its stock price is unlikely to fluctuate very much.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia (NVDA), not Apple (AAPL).  The headline and content discuss Nvidia's investor focus and diversification efforts beyond data centers. This news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is extremely low.  Any price movement would be unrelated and due to other market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Nvidia's need to appeal to a broader audience beyond data centers, mentioning its efforts in gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned and the news primarily concerns Nvidia, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely minimal. The probability of AAPL's stock price being influenced by this news is very low, as the article does not contain material information relevant to Apple's business or financial prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia's need to appeal to a bigger crowd, focusing on data centers, gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics. However, the company mentioned in the prompt is Apple Inc. (AAPL), not Nvidia. Since the news does not directly mention or relate to Apple's current performance, products, or strategies, it's unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news is relatively low and can be considered neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news is focused on Nvidia and its need to appeal to a broader audience, emphasizing its focus on data centers while making significant efforts in gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price movements. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
