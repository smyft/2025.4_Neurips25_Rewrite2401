(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges Apple Inc. is facing, particularly its declining market share in the wake of increased competition from Android manufacturers. Moreover, the restrictions on AI technology exports could impact its ability to innovate and regain market share. While there is potential for AI advancements, which could benefit AAPL in the long run, the immediate sentiment seems to lean negative due to current hurdles and underwhelming product launches. Thus, the probabilities reflect more caution regarding a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the article acknowledges Apple's struggle to regain market share and the mixed reception to its iPhone 16 series, it highlights Apple's strong growth in non-core markets and its potential in AI. However, the current AI restrictions imposed by the US government could hinder Apple's growth, particularly in China, where its AI suite isn't readily available. The upcoming change in administration and potential policy shifts add uncertainty. The article explicitly states that other AI stocks might offer greater and quicker returns than AAPL. Considering these factors, there's a higher probability of a stock price decline, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's overall strength and brand. Hedge fund interest indicates some confidence, but the specific mention that other AI stocks may be a better immediate investment suggests a cautious outlook for AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is losing market share, particularly in China due to the lack of a competitive AI suite and new US export restrictions on AI chips, the article also highlights Apple's continued strength in non-core markets.  The uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulations introduces further volatility. The fact that Apple is ranked 2nd on a list of important AI news and ratings suggests some positive investor sentiment, but the article itself is cautious, suggesting other AI stocks may offer better returns. The overall tone is somewhat negative, focusing on Apple's struggles and the competitive landscape. However, the article does not present any specific financial news impacting Apple\u2019s immediate future and the potential impact of the US export regulations on Apple's operations is unclear. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is considered slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, albeit with significant uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple has lost market share in the final quarter of 2024, with a 2% sales decline and competitors gaining strength, particularly in China where Apple's AI features are not available. Additionally, the US government's new restrictions on AI chip exports could impact the broader tech sector, including Apple's supply chain and AI development efforts. On the positive side, Apple is working on partnerships to integrate AI features in China and remains a dominant player in the global market. However, the mixed response to its AI suite and the competitive pressures weigh more heavily in this analysis.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggle to regain market share in 2025, particularly in the AI sector, due to restrictions on AI chip exports to China and other countries. However, the US government's new regulations may help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, which could benefit Apple in the long run. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's new artificial intelligence suite is not available in China, hindering its performance in the region. Despite this, the company is trying to partner with local players to provide AI features. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling, as the current challenges and restrictions may outweigh the potential benefits of the new regulations.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., including market share losses, restrictions on AI chip exports, and increased competition from Chinese Android device makers. Despite strong performance in non-core markets, these factors could negatively impact investor sentiment and future growth prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including a decline in market share, particularly in the competitive AI sector and due to new restrictions on AI chip exports. The mixed response to recent product launches and the potential for increased competition from Android manufacturers exacerbate concerns. While there are positive mentions regarding Apple's initiatives in non-core markets and its potential in AI, the immediate implications of market share loss and regulatory hurdles dominate the sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is greater than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall slightly negative outlook for Apple. The primary concern is Apple's struggle to maintain market share and the challenges it faces in the AI sector, particularly due to export restrictions and competition in China. While Apple is attempting to mitigate these issues through partnerships and has seen success in non-core markets, the negative aspects appear to outweigh the positives in the short term. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of stock price decline, suggesting a consensus among analysts. Given this, and considering the content of the article, I'm placing a slightly higher probability on the stock price falling. The lack of immediate positive catalysts and the existing challenges contribute to this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is facing challenges like declining market share and the mixed reception of its new iPhone, its strength in non-core markets and its potential in AI remain.  However, several negative factors outweigh the positives. The US government's AI chip export restrictions, particularly impacting China, are likely to negatively affect Apple's near-term growth.  The uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration adds further volatility. Although Apple is attempting to mitigate this by partnering with local players in China, this is a reactive strategy rather than a proactive offensive.  The consistent prediction from various AI models of a higher probability of a price fall further supports this conclusion. While the high number of hedge fund holders suggests some level of confidence,  the explicit statement in the article that other AI stocks offer better returns indicates a bearish sentiment regarding AAPL's short-term prospects. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, the company is facing challenges such as declining market share, particularly in China due to the lack of availability of its AI suite, and increased competition from Android device makers. Additionally, new US restrictions on AI chip exports could potentially hinder Apple's innovation and supply chain. On the positive side, Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and is exploring partnerships to integrate AI features in China. However, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to immediate hurdles and underwhelming product launches. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious outlook, with higher probabilities assigned to a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's struggles, including declining market share, particularly in China, due to the lack of competitive AI features and new US export restrictions on AI chips. While Apple is working on partnerships to integrate AI features in China and remains a dominant player globally, the mixed response to its AI suite and competitive pressures weigh heavily. The US government's restrictions aim to maintain US leadership in AI, which could benefit Apple in the long run but may hinder its short-term growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling. The overall sentiment leans negative due to current hurdles and underwhelming product launches.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with the company facing challenges such as losing market share, particularly in China, and being impacted by US government restrictions on AI chip exports. However, the company is working on partnerships to integrate AI features in China and remains a dominant player in the global market. Considering these factors and the overall tone of the news article, as well as the predictions from other models, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., including market share losses, restrictions on AI chip exports, and increased competition from Chinese Android device makers. Despite strong performance in non-core markets, these factors could negatively impact investor sentiment and future growth prospects. The new administration's uncertainty and the ongoing restrictions could further delay Apple's efforts to regain market share. Previous predictions from various models suggest a general downward trend, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 for stock price decreases.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news about Apple Inc. highlights significant challenges, including a decline in market share due to increased competition from Android manufacturers in China and restrictions on AI chip exports by the US government. These factors create an immediate negative sentiment around AAPL's stock price. While the company has potential growth in non-core markets and is trying to innovate in the AI sector, the current uncertainties and market pressures weigh heavily on its short-term prospects. Previous predictions have indicated a consistent trend towards a higher probability of stock price decline, reflecting cautious sentiment among analysts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news continues to present a mixed to negative outlook for Apple. The consistent concerns revolve around declining market share, especially in China due to AI limitations, and the impact of US AI chip export restrictions. While Apple is attempting to address these issues with partnerships and growth in non-core markets, the overall sentiment remains cautious. The previous rounds of predictions consistently favored a higher probability of a stock price decline. Furthermore, there isn't any decisively new positive information that would change this negative outlook significantly. Therefore, I will persist with assigning higher probability of stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company faces challenges like declining market share (especially in China due to AI limitations and US export restrictions), strong performance in other markets and potential AI advancements offer some counterbalance.  The incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulation adds considerable uncertainty.  The consistent trend in previous predictions shows a higher probability of a price fall, largely due to the immediate negative factors outweighing potential long-term benefits.  The article's explicit comparison to other, supposedly more promising AI stocks also contributes to this negative sentiment. However, Apple's overall strength and large number of hedge fund holders suggest a degree of underlying confidence in the long term. Considering the short-term headwinds and the consensus from previous predictions, the probability of a price decline is higher but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, the company is facing significant challenges such as declining market share, particularly in China due to the lack of availability of its AI suite, and increased competition from Android device makers. Additionally, new US restrictions on AI chip exports could potentially hinder Apple's innovation and supply chain. The mixed response to its AI suite and competitive pressures further weigh on the sentiment. On the positive side, Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and is exploring partnerships to integrate AI features in China. However, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to immediate hurdles and underwhelming product launches. Previous predictions from various models also reflect a cautious outlook, with higher probabilities assigned to a stock price fall. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles, including declining market share, particularly in China due to the lack of competitive AI features, and new US export restrictions on AI chips.
