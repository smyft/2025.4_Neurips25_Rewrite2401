A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news mainly discusses Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and partnerships, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. However, it indicates a growing trend in AI infrastructure, which could indirectly benefit tech companies like Apple in the long run. Given that Apple recently closed with a positive change, the overall market sentiment around AI investments may have a favorable spillover effect on Apple\u2019s stock. However, since the focus of the news was not directly on Apple and more on Verizon's initiatives, the probabilities are tempered. Consequently, the probability of a rise is estimated at 60% while the probability of a fall is estimated at 40%.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's AI expansion and collaboration with major tech companies like Google Cloud and NVIDIA. While this is positive for Verizon, and indirectly positive for those partners as it validates their AI strategies, the direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is less clear. Apple is not mentioned as a direct partner in this Verizon initiative. The overall market context shows a mixed bag. Alphabet (Google) is down significantly and Microsoft is also down. But Apple had a positive close, up 3.2%. Considering the unclear immediate link to Apple and the mixed market sentiment, I assess the impact on AAPL as slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Apple might benefit indirectly from a generally bullish market for cloud and AI infrastructure, but there's no guarantee based purely on the Verizon news. Also consider this article isn't financial advice and uses historical data. In addition, the article is dated in 2025.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's investment in AI infrastructure and partnerships with major players like Google Cloud and NVIDIA.  While this is positive for the overall AI sector and could indirectly benefit Apple (through potential increased demand for Apple's products or services related to AI), the news itself doesn't directly impact Apple's business or financials significantly.  Apple already has its own strong AI initiatives. The article highlights Apple's stock closing at $229.86, up 3.2% on that day; this movement is likely due to factors unrelated to the Verizon news. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific Verizon news is low.  The prior day's market movements of other tech stocks (Alphabet down, HubSpot up) are also largely unrelated and shouldn't be used to predict Apple's movement due to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and its partnerships with companies like Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned only in the context of its closing stock price, which was up 3.2%. The news does not provide any direct information about Apple's involvement in the AI initiatives or any other developments that would significantly impact its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is neutral, leaning slightly positive given the general upward trend in AI-related stocks and AAPL's recent performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Cloud AI Today - Verizon Boosts AI Capacity With Key Strategic Partnerships' indicates a growing trend in AI demand and investments in Cloud AI infrastructure. Although the article does not directly relate to Apple Inc., the overall positive trend in the tech industry and the mention of Apple's stock price closing up 3.2% suggest a favorable market sentiment. Considering the indirect impact of the growing AI trend and the overall market conditions, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Verizon's strategic move to enhance its AI ecosystem through partnerships with key technology players. This initiative could have broader implications on the cloud AI landscape. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly involved in this news, it could benefit from the expanding cloud AI infrastructure and increased enterprise adoption of AI technologies. However, the news doesn't specifically mention Apple, which might limit its direct impact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's new AI initiative and partnerships, which do not have a direct impact on Apple. However, it reflects a broader trend in AI investment that could benefit tech companies, including Apple, in the long term. Apple had a positive closing price of $229.86, up 3.2%, indicating positive sentiment. Although there is no immediate connection between Verizon's AI strategy and Apple's business, the overall growth in the tech and AI sectors suggests some potential indirect benefits for Apple. Considering this, I estimate a slightly favorable impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's AI expansion and partnerships with major tech players. While this is beneficial for Verizon and indirectly positive for its partners, the direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is less clear. Apple is not mentioned as a direct partner in this initiative. Others' predictions are varied. The recent close for Apple was positive, suggesting positive market sentiment, but Verizon's strategy is indirect. Considering all available information, a slightly updated probability is assessed, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the overall bullish trend even the effect on Apple is not a direct one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's expansion into AI infrastructure, which is positive for the broader AI sector but has limited direct impact on Apple.  While Apple could indirectly benefit from increased industry demand for AI solutions, the news doesn't provide any specific information suggesting a direct relationship or impact. The fact that Apple's stock closed up 3.2% on the day of the news suggests positive market sentiment for Apple, potentially unrelated to the Verizon announcement.  Considering the lack of direct connection and the already positive market movement of AAPL, the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) solely due to this news is low. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly slightly favoring a rise, but with relatively low confidence.  I am taking into account the mixed predictions and the lack of direct relevance to Apple. This leads me to a neutral prediction with a slight lean toward the probability of it remaining unchanged.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Verizon's advancements in AI and its strategic partnerships, which does not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the general trend towards AI infrastructure growth could indirectly benefit Apple as a major tech company. Apple's stock recently closed up 3.2%, indicating positive market sentiment. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities are tempered. The overall market context is mixed, with some tech stocks up and others down. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's strategic partnerships to boost its AI capacity, which indicates a growing trend in AI infrastructure. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned as a partner, the overall positive trend in AI investments could have a favorable spillover effect on tech companies like Apple. Given that Apple's stock closed up 3.2% on the day, it suggests a positive market sentiment. However, since the news does not directly relate to Apple's business or financials, the impact is considered indirect. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news, while also considering the potential for a fall given the mixed market reactions of other tech stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and partnerships, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. However, it indicates a growing trend in AI infrastructure, which could indirectly benefit tech companies like Apple in the long run. Considering the mixed market sentiment, with Alphabet down and Microsoft also down, but Apple having a positive close, up 3.2%, I assess the impact on AAPL as slightly positive. The overall trend in the tech industry and the mention of Apple's stock price closing up suggest a favorable market sentiment. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple's involvement in the AI initiatives, the probabilities are tempered. The previous predictions from other models also show a variety of assessments, ranging from a significant rise to a neutral stance, indicating uncertainty. However, the consensus leans towards a slightly positive impact due to the overall AI trend and Apple's recent performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Verizon's efforts to boost AI capacity through partnerships with major tech companies, which is part of a broader trend in the AI and cloud infrastructure sectors. While this could have indirect benefits for Apple Inc. by promoting an environment supportive of technological innovation, there is no direct link between the news and Apple's specific operations or performance. Additionally, Apple's stock closed up 3.2%, indicating positive market sentiment independent of the Verizon news. The models analyzed showed varying degrees of predicted movements, but the general consensus leans slightly positive due to the broader market trends.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and strategic partnerships, which have limited direct relevance to Apple Inc. However, it indicates a broader trend in AI infrastructure and investment that may provide indirect benefits to tech companies like Apple. Given that Apple recently closed up 3.2%, this suggests that the market sentiment for Apple is positive. Although there is no clear connection between the Verizon news and Apple's immediate performance, the overall positive trend in AI investments may have a favorable spillover effect on Apple's stock. Taking into account the mixed market sentiment and previous predictions, I estimate a probability that Apple's stock price will rise at about 58%, while the probability of it falling is estimated at 42%.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's AI expansion and partnerships which, while positive for the AI sector and Verizon, has an indirect and limited impact on Apple. Apple is not directly involved with Verizon's news. The previous round of predictions had varying predictions. They leaned slightly towards a rise. Given the broader AI sector trend and Apple's already positive movement on the day the news broke, any further increase due to this news seems limited, but a minor bump is not impossible. The market saw a close of 3.2%, which suggests a higher sentiment for the stock that might not be directly related with the news related to Verizon. Therefore, I maintain a slight lean toward a potential rise, but close to neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's increased AI capacity and partnerships, which has an indirect, positive impact on the broader AI sector.  Apple, while not directly involved, could benefit long-term from increased AI infrastructure and adoption.  However, the connection is weak.  The fact that Apple's stock closed up 3.2% the day the news was released suggests positive market sentiment unrelated to the Verizon announcement. Analyzing previous model predictions reveals a range of probabilities, mostly slightly favoring a rise, but with relatively low confidence.  The lack of a direct link between the news and Apple, combined with the already positive market movement for AAPL, suggests a limited impact from this news alone.  The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but primarily due to existing market sentiment and broader AI trends, not the specific Verizon news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and strategic partnerships, which does not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the broader trend in AI infrastructure growth could have an indirect positive impact on Apple as a major tech player. Apple's stock recently closed up 3.2%, reflecting positive market sentiment. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities are tempered. The overall market context is mixed, with some tech stocks up and others down. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and partnerships, which does not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the growing trend in AI infrastructure could indirectly benefit Apple as a major tech company. Considering the indirect nature of the news, the mixed market context, and the previous predictions from other models, the probabilities are tempered. Apple's recent positive close of 3.2% indicates positive market sentiment, but the lack of direct impact from the Verizon news makes the projected movement uncertain.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Verizon's efforts to enhance its AI ecosystem through strategic partnerships with major tech companies. While this news has a positive implication for the broader AI infrastructure market and could benefit tech companies like Apple in the long-term, there is no direct impact on Apple's immediate business or financial standing. Moreover, Apple closed with a positive performance, up 3.2%. Previous predictions from various models were varied, but many indicated a moderate expectation for a rise based on indirect benefits and positive market sentiments. Considering the mixed signals provided by the market movements of other tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft, the current analysis leans towards a slight probability of continued positive movement.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Verizon's advancements in AI infrastructure and strategic partnerships, which do not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the overall trend in AI investments is expected to create beneficial conditions for tech companies, including Apple, indirectly. Apple recently closed up 3.2%, suggesting positive market sentiment for the stock. While there is no direct impact from the Verizon announcement, the bullish trend in the AI sector may positively influence investor perceptions of Apple. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the broader context of technological optimism, I estimate a probability of the stock price rising at approximately 0.57 and a probability of falling at around 0.43.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's AI initiatives and partnerships which indirectly supports the AI industry. However, there is no direct impact on Apple. While a rising tide lifts all boats, there is no specific data to suggest a direct link to Apple. Furthermore, previous rounds lean towards marginal increases. I am tempering the probability of a rise due this. I believe that many have already priced in the broader impacts in their models and initial market movements. Therefore, the effect of this news is limited and probably already baked into the the last trading session.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's increased AI capacity and partnerships, which indirectly benefits the broader AI sector. Apple could see long-term gains from increased AI infrastructure and adoption. However, the connection is weak. Apple's stock already closed up 3.2% on the news release date, suggesting positive market sentiment unrelated to the Verizon announcement.  Analyzing previous model predictions reveals a range of probabilities, mostly slightly favoring a rise (averaging around 0.55 rise, 0.45 fall), but with relatively low confidence. The lack of a direct link between the news and Apple, combined with the already positive market movement for AAPL, suggests a limited impact from this news alone. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but primarily due to existing market sentiment and broader AI trends, not the specific Verizon news.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the slight positive bias in the previous models and Apple's own positive market performance on the day of the news, but acknowledging the weak connection to the Verizon news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and strategic partnerships, which does not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the broader trend in AI infrastructure growth could have an indirect positive impact on Apple as a major tech player. Apple's stock recently closed up 3.2%, reflecting positive market sentiment. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities are tempered. The overall market context is mixed, with some tech stocks up and others down. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and strategic partnerships, which does not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the growing trend in AI infrastructure could indirectly benefit Apple as a major tech company. Apple's stock recently closed up 3.2%, reflecting positive market sentiment. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple, the probabilities are tempered. The overall market context is mixed, with some tech stocks up and others down. Based on the analysis of previous predictions and the current market trend, I estimate a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and strategic partnerships, which does not directly involve Apple Inc. However, the growing trend in AI infrastructure could indirectly benefit Apple as a major tech company. Considering the indirect nature of the news, the mixed market context, and the previous predictions from other models, the probabilities are tempered. Apple's recent positive close of 3.2% indicates positive market sentiment. Given the analysis of the news and the consensus from previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to the overall positive trend in AI investments and the favorable market sentiment for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Verizon's efforts to enhance its AI ecosystem through strategic partnerships with major tech companies.
