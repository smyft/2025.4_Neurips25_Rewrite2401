A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news mainly discusses Verizon's advancements in AI capacity and partnerships, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. However, it indicates a growing trend in AI infrastructure, which could indirectly benefit tech companies like Apple in the long run. Given that Apple recently closed with a positive change, the overall market sentiment around AI investments may have a favorable spillover effect on Apple\u2019s stock. However, since the focus of the news was not directly on Apple and more on Verizon's initiatives, the probabilities are tempered. Consequently, the probability of a rise is estimated at 60% while the probability of a fall is estimated at 40%.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's AI expansion and collaboration with major tech companies like Google Cloud and NVIDIA. While this is positive for Verizon, and indirectly positive for those partners as it validates their AI strategies, the direct impact on Apple (AAPL) is less clear. Apple is not mentioned as a direct partner in this Verizon initiative. The overall market context shows a mixed bag. Alphabet (Google) is down significantly and Microsoft is also down. But Apple had a positive close, up 3.2%. Considering the unclear immediate link to Apple and the mixed market sentiment, I assess the impact on AAPL as slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Apple might benefit indirectly from a generally bullish market for cloud and AI infrastructure, but there's no guarantee based purely on the Verizon news. Also consider this article isn't financial advice and uses historical data. In addition, the article is dated in 2025.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Verizon's investment in AI infrastructure and partnerships with major players like Google Cloud and NVIDIA.  While this is positive for the overall AI sector and could indirectly benefit Apple (through potential increased demand for Apple's products or services related to AI), the news itself doesn't directly impact Apple's business or financials significantly.  Apple already has its own strong AI initiatives. The article highlights Apple's stock closing at $229.86, up 3.2% on that day; this movement is likely due to factors unrelated to the Verizon news. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific Verizon news is low.  The prior day's market movements of other tech stocks (Alphabet down, HubSpot up) are also largely unrelated and shouldn't be used to predict Apple's movement due to this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Verizon's new AI initiative and its partnerships with companies like Google Cloud, Meta, NVIDIA, and Vultr. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned only in the context of its closing stock price, which was up 3.2%. The news does not provide any direct information about Apple's involvement in the AI initiatives or any other developments that would significantly impact its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is neutral, leaning slightly positive given the general upward trend in AI-related stocks and AAPL's recent performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Cloud AI Today - Verizon Boosts AI Capacity With Key Strategic Partnerships' indicates a growing trend in AI demand and investments in Cloud AI infrastructure. Although the article does not directly relate to Apple Inc., the overall positive trend in the tech industry and the mention of Apple's stock price closing up 3.2% suggest a favorable market sentiment. Considering the indirect impact of the growing AI trend and the overall market conditions, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Verizon's strategic move to enhance its AI ecosystem through partnerships with key technology players. This initiative could have broader implications on the cloud AI landscape. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly involved in this news, it could benefit from the expanding cloud AI infrastructure and increased enterprise adoption of AI technologies. However, the news doesn't specifically mention Apple, which might limit its direct impact.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
