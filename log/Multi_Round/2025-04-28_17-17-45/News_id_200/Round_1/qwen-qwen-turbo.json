(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The bullish outlook on the Nasdaq 100, as expressed by Evercore ISI's Rich Ross, indicates continued strength in the technology sector, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, the pullback in Treasury yields, especially the 10-year yield, suggests a better environment for equity markets. Technical indicators also point to stability in the Nasdaq, with Apple potentially benefiting from this momentum as it is expected to report earnings soon. While uncertainties remain, particularly surrounding interest rates, the general sentiment is positive, and thus, there is a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising relative to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100, driven by technology stocks. Evercore ISI's technical analysis indicates potential for new all-time highs. While rising bond yields initially posed a threat, they have since retreated. The article highlights Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential for a 'catch a bid' as it nears its 200-day moving average, suggesting potential upside for the stock. Semiconductor strength also points to continued tech leadership. However, it is not all straightforwardly positive, some signals point to overheated conditions and the article notes the importance of earnings reports. Nevertheless, the balance seems to favor a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the overall positive outlook for the Nasdaq 100 and the tech sector, citing several technical indicators pointing towards continued growth.  While acknowledging the potential impact of rising bond yields, the article emphasizes that these yields have recently pulled back, and that the tech sector, especially large-cap companies like Apple, is expected to continue to perform well.  The upcoming earnings season is highlighted, implying that strong performance from companies like Apple could further boost the market.  Specifically, the article mentions that analysts are watching for Apple to catch a bid as it nears its 200-DMA.  Therefore, the positive outlook for the tech sector, coupled with the anticipation surrounding Apple's earnings report, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple.  However, it's important to note that there's always inherent uncertainty in the market, and unexpected factors could negatively influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook for the Nasdaq 100 Index, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross and other analysts expecting the rally to continue despite rising bond yields. The article mentions that technology stocks, including Apple, are in a strong position to lead the market higher. Positive technical signals, such as the Nasdaq 100 trading above its 200-day moving average, and the potential for falling yields, which are good for market breadth, support this outlook. Additionally, the article notes that Apple is nearing its 200-DMA, which could attract buying interest. Given these factors, the overall sentiment is positive for Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for the Nasdaq 100 Index to continue its historic bull run, with Evercore ISI's Rich Ross expressing confidence in the technology sector's ability to lead the market higher. Apple Inc. is mentioned as a key company to watch, particularly as it approaches its 200-day moving average. The article also notes that falling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation, which could benefit Apple. With the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index poised to hit fresh all-time highs, the technical analysis suggests a positive outlook for Apple and the broader tech sector.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Nasdaq 100's historic bull run and its potential to continue, driven by Big Tech companies like Apple Inc. Evercore ISI's Rich Ross expects the rally to continue despite rising bond yields, and technical analysts see positive signals for the index to hit fresh all-time highs. The article also mentions that Apple is set to report quarterly earnings, which could impact the stock price. However, overall sentiment is bullish, with technical supports and dip-buying opportunities identified. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued bull run for the Nasdaq 100, driven by favorable factors such as reduced bond yields and the potential for positive earnings reports. The analyst notes that technology stocks, including Apple, remain in an outstanding position to contribute to this market upward trend. However, it's noted that there are upcoming pivotal events, including Fed policy decisions and earnings announcements, which could affect short-term volatility.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
