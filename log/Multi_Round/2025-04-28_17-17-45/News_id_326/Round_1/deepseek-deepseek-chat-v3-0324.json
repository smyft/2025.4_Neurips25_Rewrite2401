The core reason cited is a 'lukewarm' reception of Apple's AI, which is a crucial growth area. Analyst downgrades often lead to investor concern and decreased trading volume due to lower confidence.

Analyst downgrades often negatively impact stock prices. While Apple is a large, established company, negative sentiment, especially regarding a key area of future growth like AI, can still cause short-term stock price declines. However, the impact might be limited due to the size and resilience of Apple.  The probability of a price fall is therefore weighted higher, but a significant drop is less likely given Apple's overall market position. A small rise is still possible due to other market factors or investor sentiment not directly reflected in this single news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.
