While this indirectly relates to Apple's product sales, it's unlikely to significantly impact the stock price. The article focuses on a user problem, not a company-wide issue or announcement of a new product.  The cost of an upgrade ($100-$500) is relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue and is not necessarily indicative of increased sales. The direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price is negligible. Therefore, the probabilities of a price increase or decrease are close to equal, with slight bias toward no change.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Your iPhone Storage Is Full Again.
