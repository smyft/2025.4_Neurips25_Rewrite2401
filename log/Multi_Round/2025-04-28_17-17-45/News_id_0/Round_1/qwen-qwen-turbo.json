(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?\nNews Content: DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding the performance of Apple and other tech giants in the face of heavy investments in AI. While Apple reported a modest earnings increase of +7.1%, concerns about weak iPhone demand in China and increased competition present potential headwinds. Despite favorable market reactions to earnings reports, the prevailing skepticism about substantial investments in AI and competition risks may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of the potential for both rises and falls in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). It acknowledges Apple's better-than-feared earnings, but also highlights China as a major risk due to slowing iPhone demand and increased competition from local Chinese companies. The potential for tariffs is also a significant concern for Apple. While the overall tech sector and Mag 7 earnings show positive growth, the specific challenges faced by Apple in China, its AI struggles, and tariff risks outweigh the general positive trends. This suggests a higher likelihood of a price decrease in accordance with negative press.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations, the report highlights concerns about weakening iPhone demand in China and intensifying competition.  The positive market reaction to Apple's results was attributed more to relief over better-than-feared numbers, rather than strong underlying performance.  The article also emphasizes the uncertainty around the AI investments of other tech giants, which indirectly suggests Apple's own AI struggles are a significant headwind.  The overall positive sentiment regarding the tech sector is somewhat tempered by the China risk specific to Apple. Based on this, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the fall isn't predicted to be drastic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's competitive position in China, tepid iPhone demand, and AI struggles, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's December-quarter earnings and revenues showed growth, albeit modest, and net margins improved. The mixed signals suggest uncertainty, but the emphasis on challenges in China and AI may weigh more heavily on investor perceptions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the earnings of major tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and their performance in the AI race. While Apple's earnings report was described as better-than-feared, concerns about iPhone demand in China and AI struggles are noted. However, the overall sentiment seems to be more positive for Apple compared to some of its peers, with net margins increasing. Given that the news does not introduce significant negative surprises specific to Apple and considering the general positive market reception for Apple's results, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the recent earnings reports of the 'Mag 7' companies, including Apple, and the impact of DeepSeek on the AI competitive landscape. While Apple's December-quarter earnings were up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues, the company faces challenges in China, including tepid iPhone demand and AI struggles. The article also mentions that the market's focus was on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, and that Apple and Tesla received favorable market reception despite some disappointments in their core results. Overall, the article presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple's earnings increased by 7.1% with revenues up 4%, there are concerns regarding tepid iPhone demand in China and potential competition from local competitors. Additionally, the uncertainty around AI development and the ongoing tariff issues add to the complexity. However, the favorable market reception following previous earnings and the stable performance compared to peers suggest a somewhat cautious optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
