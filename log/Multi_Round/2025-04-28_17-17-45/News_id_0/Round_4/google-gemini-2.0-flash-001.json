(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?\nNews Content: DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding the performance of Apple and other tech giants in the face of heavy investments in AI. While Apple reported a modest earnings increase of +7.1%, concerns about weak iPhone demand in China and increased competition present potential headwinds. Despite favorable market reactions to earnings reports, the prevailing skepticism about substantial investments in AI and competition risks may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a cautious outlook for AAPL. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view of the potential for both rises and falls in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). It acknowledges Apple's better-than-feared earnings, but also highlights China as a major risk due to slowing iPhone demand and increased competition from local Chinese companies. The potential for tariffs is also a significant concern for Apple. While the overall tech sector and Mag 7 earnings show positive growth, the specific challenges faced by Apple in China, its AI struggles, and tariff risks outweigh the general positive trends. This suggests a higher likelihood of a price decrease in accordance with negative press.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations, the report highlights concerns about weakening iPhone demand in China and intensifying competition.  The positive market reaction to Apple's results was attributed more to relief over better-than-feared numbers, rather than strong underlying performance.  The article also emphasizes the uncertainty around the AI investments of other tech giants, which indirectly suggests Apple's own AI struggles are a significant headwind.  The overall positive sentiment regarding the tech sector is somewhat tempered by the China risk specific to Apple. Based on this, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the fall isn't predicted to be drastic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's competitive position in China, tepid iPhone demand, and AI struggles, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's December-quarter earnings and revenues showed growth, albeit modest, and net margins improved. The mixed signals suggest uncertainty, but the emphasis on challenges in China and AI may weigh more heavily on investor perceptions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the earnings of major tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and their performance in the AI race. While Apple's earnings report was described as better-than-feared, concerns about iPhone demand in China and AI struggles are noted. However, the overall sentiment seems to be more positive for Apple compared to some of its peers, with net margins increasing. Given that the news does not introduce significant negative surprises specific to Apple and considering the general positive market reception for Apple's results, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the recent earnings reports of the 'Mag 7' companies, including Apple, and the impact of DeepSeek on the AI competitive landscape. While Apple's December-quarter earnings were up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues, the company faces challenges in China, including tepid iPhone demand and AI struggles. The article also mentions that the market's focus was on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, and that Apple and Tesla received favorable market reception despite some disappointments in their core results. Overall, the article presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple's earnings increased by 7.1% with revenues up 4%, there are concerns regarding tepid iPhone demand in China and potential competition from local competitors. Additionally, the uncertainty around AI development and the ongoing tariff issues add to the complexity. However, the favorable market reception following previous earnings and the stable performance compared to peers suggest a somewhat cautious optimism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company reported a modest earnings increase of 7.1% with a 4% rise in revenues, which is a positive sign. However, there are significant concerns about weak iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local players, and ongoing risks related to AI investments and potential tariffs. While there was a favorable market reaction to better-than-expected earnings, the prevailing issues overshadow this optimism. Given the competitive landscape and economic pressures, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook for AAPL with a slight bias toward a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The previous round of predictions presents a mixed sentiment regarding Apple, with probabilities hovering around 50/50 for both rise and fall. Concerns regarding China and AI are balanced against decent earnings and positive market reception. The current news lacks any significantly new information that would drastically shift this balance. The fact that other models have not converged on a strong directional bias, even after a first round of analysis, reinforces the perception of uncertainty. Given this, I will slightly adjust the probabilities, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to existing concerns, but acknowledging that the company isn't facing any immediate crisis. Also note that lower range of predictions (0.35) exists in previous round which indicates a considerable down side for the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company beat earnings expectations and showed improved margins, significant headwinds exist.  Concerns about weakening iPhone demand in China, intensified competition in that key market, and ongoing struggles in the AI sector are substantial risks.  The positive market reaction to the earnings report seems to be more a relief reaction than an indication of strong underlying momentum.  While the broader tech sector shows positive growth, Apple's specific challenges, particularly in China and AI, outweigh the general positive trends. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, mostly reflecting the mixed signals. Considering these factors, and the lack of any overwhelmingly positive news, the probability of a price rise is considered slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive aspects include modest earnings growth (+7.1%) and improved net margins, alongside a generally favorable market reception to recent earnings. However, significant concerns arise from tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese companies, and ongoing struggles in AI development. Additionally, potential tariffs pose a further risk. While the broader tech sector shows positive growth, Apple-specific challenges are notable. Given these mixed signals and the emphasis on China-related risks, the balance tilts slightly towards a negative short-term impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company reported modest earnings growth of +7.1% and +4% higher revenues, concerns about weak iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese companies, and AI struggles are significant headwinds. The market's favorable reception to Apple's earnings report was more due to relief over better-than-feared numbers rather than strong performance. Additionally, potential tariffs pose a risk. However, Apple's net margins improved, and the overall tech sector shows positive growth trends. Considering these factors, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock price movement. While Apple's earnings report was better-than-feared, concerns about iPhone demand in China and AI struggles are noted. However, the overall sentiment seems to be more positive for Apple compared to some of its peers, with net margins increasing. The favorable market reception following previous earnings and the stable performance compared to peers suggest a somewhat cautious optimism. Considering the mixed signals and the general positive market reception, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple reported modest earnings growth with a +7.1% increase in earnings and +4% revenue growth. However, concerns remain regarding Apple's tepid iPhone demand in China and increased competition. While the market welcomed the results positively, the mixed signals, combined with China's risks and ongoing AI struggles, suggest a cautious outlook. Although there is a general positive sentiment, especially when compared to peers like Microsoft, the specific risks related to China and tariffs still create uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. Earnings growth of +7.1% and higher revenues signals some positive momentum. However, significant risks loom from weak iPhone demand in China and relentless competition from local companies. Additionally, ongoing struggles in AI investment and potential tariffs further complicate the situation. Other models indicate a general trend of cautious sentiment leaning towards potential declines in stock price due to these challenges, despite the relatively favorable market reception of Apple's earnings. Taking these factors into account, I estimate a higher probability for a price decline over a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The persistent concerns about Apple's performance in China, especially the tepid iPhone demand and increasing local competition, weigh heavily on the stock's outlook. While Apple's earnings weren't disastrous and margins improved, the general sense is that the results were more of a relief than indicative of robust growth. The AI struggles and potential for tariffs further compound these challenges. The previous round of predictions showed a range centered around a near-even split, but with a slight leaning towards a price decrease. Since there isn't substantial positive news to counter these ongoing concerns, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more pronounced likelihood of a stock price fall. The models that previously predicted the highest likelihood of price increases have adjusted downwards as well, which also provides more evidence to expect a downward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings beat expectations and margins improved, significant headwinds remain.  Weakening iPhone demand in China, increased competition there, and ongoing AI struggles are substantial risks. The positive market reaction was more relief than enthusiasm.  The overall positive tech sector trend is offset by Apple's unique challenges, particularly the China market and AI development. Previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the mixed signals. Considering these factors, and the lack of overwhelmingly positive news, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.  However, the probabilities are close to even, indicating significant uncertainty. The consensus from previous models leans towards a slight increase in the probability of a price fall in subsequent rounds. This is influenced by concerns regarding the long-term impact of the China market, AI sector struggles and potential tariffs.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported modest earnings growth of +7.1% and +4% higher revenues, with improved net margins. The market initially reacted favorably to the earnings report, likely due to relief over better-than-feared numbers. However, significant concerns arise from tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese companies, potential tariffs, and ongoing struggles in AI development. While the broader tech sector shows positive growth, Apple-specific challenges are notable. The mixed signals and emphasis on China-related risks slightly tilt the balance towards a negative short-term impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company reported modest earnings growth of +7.1% and +4% higher revenues, concerns about weak iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese companies, and AI struggles are significant headwinds. The market's favorable reception to Apple's earnings report was more due to relief over better-than-feared numbers rather than strong performance. Additionally, potential tariffs pose a risk. Considering these factors, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the company reporting modest earnings growth of +7.1% and +4% higher revenues. However, concerns about weak iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese companies, and AI struggles are significant headwinds. The market's favorable reception to Apple's earnings report was more due to relief over better-than-feared numbers rather than strong performance. Considering these factors, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple reported modest earnings growth with a +7.1% increase in earnings and +4% revenue growth. However, concerns remain regarding Apple's tepid iPhone demand in China and increased competition. While the market welcomed the results positively, the mixed signals, combined with China's risks and ongoing AI struggles, suggest a cautious outlook. Although there is a general positive sentiment, especially when compared to peers like Microsoft, the specific risks related to China and tariffs still create uncertainties.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The mixed outlook surrounding Apple's recent earnings report demonstrates both positive and negative factors. While the company reported a modest earnings growth of +7.1% and +4% growth in revenues, there are significant headwinds, particularly concerning weak iPhone demand in China and increasing competitive pressure from local Chinese companies. Furthermore, ongoing challenges in AI development and potential tariff implications pose additional risks. Market sentiment appears to be cautious, leaning slightly towards a price decline due to these challenges, despite some relief in the earnings report results. This analysis reflects a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The continuing concerns about Apple's performance in China, especially the tepid iPhone demand and increasing local competition, remain a significant drag on the stock's outlook. While the previous quarter's earnings weren't disastrous and margins improved, the prevailing sentiment suggests the results were more of a relief rather than indicative of robust growth. The challenges in AI investment, coupled with the potential for tariffs, further compound these concerns. The prior rounds' predictions displayed a consolidation around a near-even split, but with a slight bias towards a price decrease, reflecting the lack of substantial positive catalysts to counteract the ongoing concerns. Given this assessment, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a more pronounced likelihood of a stock price fall, aligning with the gradual downward adjustments made by the other models in previous iterations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple beat earnings expectations and showed improved margins, significant headwinds remain.  Weakening iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and ongoing AI struggles are substantial risks. The positive market reaction was more of a relief than an indication of strong underlying momentum. The overall positive tech sector trend is partially offset by Apple's specific challenges, particularly in the China market and AI development.  Previous model predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the overall uncertainty and the weight given to the negative factors.  The lack of overwhelmingly positive news reinforces this cautious outlook.  While the earnings beat is positive, the China concerns, competition, and AI struggles are significant enough to outweigh the positive aspects for the near term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the company reported modest earnings growth of +7.1% and +4% higher revenues, there are significant concerns about weak iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese companies, and ongoing struggles in AI development. The market's initial positive reaction was more due to relief over better-than-feared numbers rather than strong underlying performance. Additionally, potential tariffs pose a further risk. The broader tech sector shows positive growth, but Apple-specific challenges are notable. Considering these mixed signals and the emphasis on China-related risks, the balance tilts slightly towards a negative short-term impact on the stock price. Previous model predictions also reflect this cautious sentiment, with a general trend leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
