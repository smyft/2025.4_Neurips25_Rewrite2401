This is a strong signal to investors. Furthermore, the article highlights the potential for AI innovation, specifically citing Apple's AFM LLM, as a catalyst for future growth and device upgrades. Projected growth in the Services segment (12% YoY) further reinforces the bullish sentiment. However, there's a mention of regulatory risks in 2025 and GuruFocus identified warning signs, which contribute to a slight possibility of a price decrease.
