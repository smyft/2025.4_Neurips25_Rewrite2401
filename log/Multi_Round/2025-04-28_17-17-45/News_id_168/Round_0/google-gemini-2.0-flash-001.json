This could negatively impact Apple's App Store revenue, as Apple collects a significant commission on app sales and in-app purchases. However, Apple is a massive company with diverse revenue streams, so the impact will likely be marginal. The news focuses mostly on Epic and Google news, with apple mentioned only to indicate a competitive relation. Therefore, the market's immediate reaction might be muted, but the long-term implications of increased competition could slightly weigh on Apple's stock. Given Apple's market capitalization and diverse business, a small down turn is more likely than a strong negative sentiment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```"
