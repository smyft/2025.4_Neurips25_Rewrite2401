This could be seen as a negative development for Apple, as it may lead to increased competition and potentially lower revenue for the company. However, it's worth noting that the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited, as Epic Games' app marketplace is not yet a significant player in the market. Additionally, Apple's diversified business and strong brand loyalty may mitigate the negative impact. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising as 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.6.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
