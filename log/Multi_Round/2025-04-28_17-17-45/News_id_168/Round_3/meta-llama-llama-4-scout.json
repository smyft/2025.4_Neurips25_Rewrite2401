A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The announcement of Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace challenges Apple's App Store model. This could impact Apple's revenue from in-app purchases and could lead to increased competition in the gaming sector. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate significant stock price drops. The uncertainty in the market could lead to a slight bearish sentiment, but overall, the long-term fundamentals for Apple remain strong. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the increased competition.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates Epic Games is expanding its app marketplace to mobile and including third-party games, aiming to compete directly with Apple's App Store and Google Play. This could negatively impact Apple's App Store revenue, as Apple collects a significant commission on app sales and in-app purchases. However, Apple is a massive company with diverse revenue streams, so the impact will likely be marginal. The news focuses mostly on Epic and Google news, with apple mentioned only to indicate a competitive relation. Therefore, the market's immediate reaction might be muted, but the long-term implications of increased competition could slightly weigh on Apple's stock. Given Apple's market capitalization and diverse business, a small down turn is more likely than a strong negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline mentions Epic Games, not Apple, launching a third-party games marketplace.  While Apple is mentioned, the news focuses on Epic's actions concerning Google and their own marketplace.  Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Any effect would be indirect and potentially negative if this marketplace becomes significantly popular, attracting users away from Apple's App Store which could affect App Store revenues. However, given the limited information and the fact that the news focuses on Epic's activities, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is challenging Apple's app store dominance by introducing third-party games on its marketplace. This could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions, which is a significant part of its services segment. Historically, any threat to Apple's app store ecosystem has been viewed negatively by investors. However, the immediate financial impact may be limited given Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand loyalty. The probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not drastically so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Epic Games is planning to introduce third-party games on its own app marketplace, which could potentially compete with Apple's App Store. This could be seen as a negative development for Apple, as it may lead to increased competition and potentially lower revenue for the company. However, it's worth noting that the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited, as Epic Games' app marketplace is not yet a significant player in the market. Additionally, Apple's diversified business and strong brand loyalty may mitigate the negative impact. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising as 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.6.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could potentially challenge Apple's App Store dominance. This development may lead to increased competition for Apple, potentially affecting its revenue and market share. As a result, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to concerns over Apple's market position and potential loss of revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile marketplace to include third-party games, which could impact Apple's business, particularly their App Store policies and fees. Such competition might be perceived negatively by investors who see it as a challenge to Apple's control over its ecosystem. This could potentially lead to a short-term drop in investor confidence. However, long-term implications are less clear and may depend on how Apple responds to this competition.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news of Epic Games launching third-party games on its own marketplace indicates a direct challenge to Apple's App Store, which could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions and increase competition in the mobile gaming sector. Although Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall sentiment from past predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to concerns over competition and its effect on revenue, even if the immediate impact might be limited. After analyzing previous predictions and sentiments attributed to this news, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests increased competition for Apple's App Store, which has historically been a significant revenue driver. Previous models have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock falling, citing potential revenue impact and investor concerns about Apple's competitive position. Although Epic Games' marketplace isn't currently a dominant force, its expansion and inclusion of more games pose a threat. While Apple's diversified revenue streams and brand loyalty provide a buffer, prevailing sentiment from earlier analyses leans towards a negative impact, supporting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering that trend, I will stick with the previous analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Epic Games' expansion into the mobile gaming marketplace, posing a potential competitive threat to Apple's App Store.  However, the impact on Apple is likely to be indirect and relatively minor in the short term. Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand loyalty should cushion against significant negative effects.  The previous predictions are somewhat mixed, ranging from a 30% to 45% probability of a stock price rise and a 45% to 70% probability of a fall. Considering the limited direct impact of the news on Apple and the overall strength of the company, I am leaning towards a higher probability of a slight price decrease rather than a substantial movement in either direction.  The existing uncertainty in the market due to various macroeconomic factors also contributes to this muted prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile marketplace to include third-party games, which could challenge Apple's App Store dominance. This development might be perceived as a negative by investors, as it introduces competition that could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand loyalty may mitigate significant negative impacts. Given the majority of previous predictions lean towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, and considering the potential for muted market reaction due to Apple's market capitalization and diversified business, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price fall with a lower probability of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is planning to introduce third-party games to its mobile marketplace, potentially competing with Apple's App Store. This development could lead to increased competition for Apple, potentially affecting its revenue from in-app purchases and commissions. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diversified revenue streams, and dominant market position may mitigate the negative impact. Considering the mixed implications and the fact that the news focuses more on Epic Games' actions than Apple's direct performance, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The announcement of Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace presents a challenge to Apple's App Store model, potentially impacting revenue from in-app purchases and increasing competition in the gaming sector. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diverse product offerings, and significant market presence are likely to mitigate the negative effects. Considering the predictions from previous rounds, there is a general consensus that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, due to the increased competition and potential loss of revenue. Taking into account the company's resilience and the indirect nature of the news, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a moderate bearish sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential increase in competition for Apple through Epic Games' introduction of third-party games to its mobile marketplace, which might pose a threat to App Store revenue. Multiple models predict a higher probability of a stock price fall, primarily due to concerns over increased competition. While the impact may be mitigated by Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand loyalty, the overarching sentiment leans towards a higher chance of a stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games on its own mobile marketplace presents a potential challenge to Apple's App Store model, suggesting increased competition that could negatively impact Apple's revenue from app store commissions. Most previous predictions have indicated a higher probability of a stock price fall due to concerns about competitive pressures. While Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand loyalty could mitigate these impacts, the overall sentiment leaning toward increased competition suggests a moderate probability of a decline in stock price. Therefore, taking into account the mixed implications of the news and considering historical sentiments, I estimate probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: Epic Games' move to introduce third-party games on its own marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, a significant revenue generator for Apple through commissions. While Apple possesses a strong brand, diverse revenue streams, and loyal customer base, the increased competition could negatively impact investor sentiment, at least in the short term. Previous models consistently predict a higher probability of a stock price decline, citing concerns over potential revenue loss and increased market competition. Taking into account the trend of previous predictions and the inherent competitive threat, I maintain a bearish outlook. However, Apple's established market position and diverse business could limit the extent of the potential decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game marketplace is indirectly relevant to Apple. While it poses a potential competitive threat to Apple's App Store, the impact is likely to be limited.  Apple's vast market capitalization, diverse revenue streams, and strong brand loyalty provide significant buffers against a substantial negative impact.  The previous predictions consistently show a leaning toward a higher probability of a stock price fall, but the magnitude of predicted decline varies considerably.  This suggests a degree of uncertainty.  Considering the indirect nature of the competitive threat and the strong fundamentals of Apple, I anticipate a muted market response.  The consensus among previous models, which leans bearish, is taken into consideration, though the magnitude of that bearishness is tempered by Apple's resilience. The probability of a price drop is slightly higher than a price rise, reflecting a modest negative sentiment but acknowledging Apple's ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a potential competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which is a significant revenue source for Apple. While Apple's strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams may mitigate some negative impact, the overall sentiment from previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall due to concerns over competition and its effect on revenue. The immediate impact might be limited, but the long-term implications could weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Epic Games is planning to introduce third-party games to its mobile marketplace, potentially competing with Apple's App Store.

This development could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions and increase competition in the mobile gaming sector. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diversified revenue streams, and dominant market position may mitigate the negative impact.
