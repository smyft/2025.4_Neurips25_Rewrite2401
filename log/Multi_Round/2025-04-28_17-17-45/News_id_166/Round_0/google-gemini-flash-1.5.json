This is generally considered neutral news.  A 'largely in-line' prediction suggests no significant positive or negative surprises are anticipated.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) is relatively low.  While there's always some inherent market volatility, this particular news item alone provides no compelling reason for a major price shift.  The lack of detail due to the paywalled content further supports this conclusion. We assume a slight inclination towards a price stay or slight decrease due to the lack of positive news that could drive the price up.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Poised for Largely In-Line First-Quarter Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
