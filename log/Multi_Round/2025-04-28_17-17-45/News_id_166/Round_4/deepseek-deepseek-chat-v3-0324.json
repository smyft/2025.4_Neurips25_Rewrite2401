A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. Such news typically does not provoke significant market movements, as 'in-line' results suggest that the company is performing as anticipated. While there may be a slight upward pressure on the stock due to the affirmation of expected performance, the lack of any surprising positive or negative news leads to a balanced outlook. Thus, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to be 'largely in line' with estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This implies no major surprises (positive or negative). In-line results generally lead to minimal stock price movement as expectations are already priced in. There is also a lack of detail in the provided snippet and a need for a premium subscription to get the full article, limiting complete analysis. If Morgan Satnley says it is expected to be in line, it might actually under expectation to a degree. The lack of more information should indicate more downward pressure than in line results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations. This is generally considered neutral news.  A 'largely in-line' prediction suggests no significant positive or negative surprises are anticipated.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) is relatively low.  While there's always some inherent market volatility, this particular news item alone provides no compelling reason for a major price shift.  The lack of detail due to the paywalled content further supports this conclusion. We assume a slight inclination towards a price stay or slight decrease due to the lack of positive news that could drive the price up.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. Since the revenue is in line with expectations, this is typically seen as neutral news. However, given Apple's historical performance and market sentiment, investors might react slightly positively to the confirmation of expected performance. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the lack of negative surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no significant positive or negative surprises expected from Apple's revenue. Typically, in-line revenue expectations do not provide a strong catalyst for stock price movements. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is 0.55 (moderately positive due to the stability of expectations) and the probability of the stock price falling is 0.45 (relatively low as there's no negative news).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This implies that there are no significant surprises or negative revelations, which could lead to a neutral to slightly positive reaction from investors. Since the revenue is expected to meet expectations, it's unlikely to lead to a significant decline in stock price. However, the lack of a positive surprise might limit the potential for a significant increase in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but overall, the movement is expected to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, which suggests a neutral outcome with no significant surprises. This is unlikely to provoke major stock price movements. Previous predictions reflect a range of beliefs, but most suggest a small inclination towards rising due to the stability of expectations, with probabilities centered around 0.55 for an increase and 0.45 for a decrease. Taking these factors into consideration, I will estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, reflecting slight positive sentiment due to consistent performance expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook. In Round 0, the predictions were mixed, with some models leaning slightly positive (0.55 rise, 0.45 fall) and others slightly negative (0.4 rise, 0.6 fall; 0.35 rise, 0.45 fall). The consensus appears to be that 'in-line' results don't typically cause significant price movements. However, the fact that multiple models predicted a slight rise suggests a possible baseline positive sentiment. Given this and to avoid being an outlier, I will lean towards a slight rise but closer to neutral than the more bullish predictions of the previous round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral, indicating that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to meet market expectations.  This is generally not a significant driver of stock price movement, as the 'in-line' expectation is likely already priced into the stock.  The lack of detail in the available news snippet further reinforces this neutrality.  While there's a possibility of a slight positive reaction due to confirmation bias (meeting expectations is better than underperforming), the overall impact is expected to be minimal.  Analyzing previous predictions reveals a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a slight probability of a price rise or a relatively stable price.  Considering the limited information and the inherent volatility of the stock market, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining flat or slightly decreasing than rising. The absence of positive news is a key consideration in this scenario.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, as per Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook, as 'in-line' results typically do not provoke significant market movements. Given the lack of positive or negative surprises, the stock price is likely to remain stable with minimal volatility. However, considering Apple's strong market position and historical performance, there might be a slight inclination towards a positive reaction. The previous predictions from other models also reflect a balanced outlook, with a slight edge towards the stock price rising. Therefore, the probabilities are set to reflect this neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook with no significant positive or negative surprises anticipated. Typically, in-line revenue expectations lead to minimal stock price movements. However, considering the historical performance of Apple and general market sentiment, there might be a slight inclination towards a positive reaction due to the confirmation of expected performance without any negative revelations. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced outlook with a slight bias towards stability rather than significant volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprises, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the lack of detailed information due to the paywalled content, the probability of a significant price movement is relatively low. However, given the historical performance and market sentiment of Apple, there might be a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. Taking into account the neutral news and the balanced outlook from previous predictions, the estimated probabilities are closer to a stable expectation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. While some models suggest a slight upward tendency due to the confirmation of expected performance, others emphasize the lack of detailed information and the potentially limited positive impact on the stock price. Considering the overall neutral outlook and previous predictions, a slight upward bias is inferred.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, which suggests a neutral outlook with no major surprises anticipated. This typically results in minimal movements in stock prices as such expectations are often already priced into the stock. While some models reflect a slight inclination towards rising due to the affirmation of expected performance, others emphasize the absence of positive news and the potential for downward pressure. Overall, it's reasonable to predict a balanced outlook with a slight bias towards the stock price rising, given the consistent historical performance of Apple and general market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news remains that Apple's revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, indicating a neutral stance. Previous rounds show a slight trend towards a marginal rise, though several models also lean towards a slight fall. Taking these previous predictions into consideration, in Round 0, there was an average of about 0.4625 of falling, and an average of rising by 0.4917, neglecting qwen/qwen-turbo as it seems has an anomaly. In Round 1, there was an average of about 0.4614 of falling, and an average of rising by 0.5157, again, neglecting qwen/qwen-turbo. This indicates a potential for slightly upward pressures. I will predict based round 1's average trend and give apple a slightly upward projection.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral, indicating that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to meet market expectations. This is generally not a significant driver of stock price movement, as the 'in-line' expectation is likely already priced into the stock.  The lack of detail in the available news snippet further reinforces this neutrality.  The previous rounds of predictions show a convergence towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting a potential confirmation bias (meeting expectations is better than underperforming). However, the majority of models considered  the lack of positive surprises likely to limit significant upward movement.  Considering this, along with the inherent volatility of the market and the limited information available, a slightly higher chance of a rise is predicted, but closer to neutral than the more strongly bullish earlier predictions.  The absence of negative news is a key factor preventing stronger downward movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This is typically neutral news as it indicates no significant positive or negative surprises. Previous predictions from other models reflect a mix of opinions, but most lean towards a slight positive inclination due to the stability of expectations and Apple's strong market position. However, the lack of any surprising positive news limits the potential for a significant price increase. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the balanced outlook from previous predictions, the probabilities are set to reflect a minimal movement with a slight bias towards stability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook with no significant positive or negative surprises anticipated. Typically, in-line revenue expectations lead to minimal stock price movements. However, considering Apple's historical performance and general market sentiment, there might be a slight inclination towards a positive reaction due to the confirmation of expected performance without any negative revelations. The previous predictions from various models reflect a balanced outlook, with a slight edge towards the stock price rising. Taking into account the neutral nature of the news and the balanced outlook from previous predictions, the estimated probabilities are closer to a stable expectation but with a slight bias towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook with no significant positive or negative surprises anticipated. Analyzing previous predictions from various models, there is a mix of opinions but a general consensus towards a neutral to slightly positive sentiment. Given the lack of detailed information and the paywalled content, the probability of a significant price movement is relatively low. However, considering Apple's historical performance and general market sentiment, there might be a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This suggests a neutral outlook as market expectations are already reflected in the stock price. Previous predictions from various models show a consistent range of probabilities with slight inclinations towards a stock price rise due to the stability of expected performance. Given the consistency in these predictions and the neutral nature of the news, the probability of a significant change in the stock price is relatively low.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, which suggests a neutral outlook without any significant surprises. Previous predictions reflect mixed sentiments, with slight inclinations towards a price rise due to stability and historical performance against a backdrop of a neutral or slightly negative view due to the lack of positive surprises. Consequently, while there may be slight upward pressure on the stock price, the overall sentiment suggests minimal volatility. Therefore, I estimate a probability of stock price rise slightly higher than that of a fall, reflecting a balanced yet mildly positive sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests a neutral outlook with no major surprises anticipated. The previous predictions from various models reflect a convergence towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting a potential confirmation bias. The neutral news, coupled with Apple's generally positive market sentiment and consistent performance, contributes to a slightly positive bias. Considering this along with overall market volatility, I predict a slight upward movement. Other models converge to this decision too, after several rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations. This is generally considered neutral news, as the market has likely already priced in these expectations.  The lack of detail due to the paywalled nature of the article further limits the ability to draw strong conclusions.  Analyzing the previous predictions across multiple models reveals a convergence towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, although this difference is generally quite small. This slight upward bias likely reflects a combination of factors: Apple's historically strong performance, confirmation bias (meeting expectations is better than missing them), and the general market sentiment towards the company. However, the absence of substantial positive or negative news prevents a strong prediction in either direction.  The consensus suggests a relatively stable price with minimal significant movement, leaning slightly towards a small increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley.
