A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. Such news typically does not provoke significant market movements, as 'in-line' results suggest that the company is performing as anticipated. While there may be a slight upward pressure on the stock due to the affirmation of expected performance, the lack of any surprising positive or negative news leads to a balanced outlook. Thus, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards stability rather than volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to be 'largely in line' with estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This implies no major surprises (positive or negative). In-line results generally lead to minimal stock price movement as expectations are already priced in. There is also a lack of detail in the provided snippet and a need for a premium subscription to get the full article, limiting complete analysis. If Morgan Satnley says it is expected to be in line, it might actually under expectation to a degree. The lack of more information should indicate more downward pressure than in line results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations. This is generally considered neutral news.  A 'largely in-line' prediction suggests no significant positive or negative surprises are anticipated.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) is relatively low.  While there's always some inherent market volatility, this particular news item alone provides no compelling reason for a major price shift.  The lack of detail due to the paywalled content further supports this conclusion. We assume a slight inclination towards a price stay or slight decrease due to the lack of positive news that could drive the price up.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. Since the revenue is in line with expectations, this is typically seen as neutral news. However, given Apple's historical performance and market sentiment, investors might react slightly positively to the confirmation of expected performance. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the lack of negative surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This neutral outlook implies that there are no significant positive or negative surprises expected from Apple's revenue. Typically, in-line revenue expectations do not provide a strong catalyst for stock price movements. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is 0.55 (moderately positive due to the stability of expectations) and the probability of the stock price falling is 0.45 (relatively low as there's no negative news).\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates, according to Morgan Stanley. This implies that there are no significant surprises or negative revelations, which could lead to a neutral to slightly positive reaction from investors. Since the revenue is expected to meet expectations, it's unlikely to lead to a significant decline in stock price. However, the lack of a positive surprise might limit the potential for a significant increase in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but overall, the movement is expected to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
