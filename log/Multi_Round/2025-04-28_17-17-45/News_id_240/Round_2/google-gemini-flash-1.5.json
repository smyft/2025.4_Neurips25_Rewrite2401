(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a significant institutional ownership at 61%, which suggests a strong influence from large shareholders on the stock price. While institutional ownership can be a positive attribute as it indicates confidence from knowledgeable investors, the article also notes that the volatility of the stock price can increase if large institutional investors decide to sell, leading to potential downside risk. The mention of recent sales by insiders raises additional concerns about the stock's stability. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of price rise due to institutional backing yet acknowledge the possibility of a price fall if large shareholders exit. Therefore, the probabilities reflect these dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's heavy institutional ownership (61%). While large institutional ownership is generally seen as positive, it also introduces vulnerability due to the potential for large sell-offs by these institutions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which can be a negative signal. However, it notes that analysts generally cover the stock, and a consensus view might be a helpful indicator. The substantial general public ownership (37%) provides some stability. Considering these factors, the impact of this specific news is likely neutral to slightly negative. Institutions owning the stock can be a strong influence that can both increase and decrease the stock value. The current data does not point clearly in either direction. I am assuming the positive and negative press will cancel each other out leading to no real movement in the price. I slightly skewed it towards a negative movement because they mention some insider selling. An important caveat is considering overall market conditions and sector-specific trends, which are not addressed here.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the situation factually without strongly advocating for a bullish or bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered roughly equal, given the information provided in this specific news article alone.  Other factors not included in this news, such as overall market trends and Apple's financial performance, would significantly impact future price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple Inc. shares, which implies that large trades by these institutions could significantly impact the stock price. Institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive indicator, as these entities conduct thorough research before investing. However, the concentration of ownership also means that coordinated selling by major institutions could lead to price volatility. The news also mentions recent insider sales, which might signal caution but are not significant enough (less than 1% ownership) to heavily influence the stock. Given these factors, the stock price is likely to remain stable or rise slightly due to institutional confidence, but there is a non-trivial risk of downward pressure if institutions decide to sell.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ownership structure of Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting that 61% of the shares are owned by institutional investors. This indicates that the stock price may be influenced by the decisions of these institutional investors. However, it does not provide any specific information about the company's financial performance, products, or market trends. The article also mentions that the top 25 shareholders own 41% of the business and that there have been recent sales by insiders. Considering the large stake of institutional investors, the stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions, but the article does not provide any strong indication of an imminent price rise or fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, recent actions suggest immediate price pressures could exist. These factors suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights that 61% of Apple Inc.'s shares are owned by institutional investors, which generally signifies confidence from major investors; however, it raises concerns about potential volatility due to the ability of these institutions to significantly influence share price through large trades. Additionally, recent sales by insiders could indicate caution, affecting market sentiment negatively. While institutional support typically stabilizes the stock, the combination of insider selling and the potential for large institutional sell-offs brings uncertainty, leading to a cautious outlook. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news highlights substantial institutional ownership in Apple, which usually signals stability due to the thorough research institutions conduct before investing. However, the article also cautions that this makes the stock vulnerable to significant price swings if these institutions decide to sell large positions. Adding to the uncertainty, the news mentions recent insider sales, which can often be interpreted as a bearish signal, even though the specific scale wasn't clarified. Considering past analyst consensus and similar analyses give nearly equal probability of rise and fall, I am moderating towards that consensus now but also weighing in the insider sales news. Seeing how in the previous round the models are leaning towards about 0.45 probability of rise, I will skew slightly to the fall probability, but not too much.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of significant price drops if these institutions decide to sell off their holdings simultaneously.  The mention of recent insider selling adds to the negative sentiment. However, the absence of details regarding the volume and reasons behind these insider sales limits the impact assessment.  The significant public ownership (37%) suggests some resistance to extreme price swings.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions, ranging from a slightly bullish to slightly bearish outlook.  The overall lack of concrete positive news and the potential for significant downward pressure from institutional selling outweighs the positive aspects of institutional ownership. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the significant institutional ownership of Apple Inc. (AAPL) at 61%, which can be both a stabilizing factor and a source of volatility. While institutional ownership often indicates confidence from knowledgeable investors, the potential for large-scale sell-offs by these institutions introduces downside risk. The mention of recent insider sales adds a layer of caution, though the article notes that insider ownership is less than 1%, limiting its impact. The general public holds 37% of the shares, providing some stability. The tone of the article is neutral, presenting facts without strong bullish or bearish signals. Given the mixed signals from institutional dominance and insider sales, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to stability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating a significant influence on the stock price. While high institutional ownership is generally positive, it also poses a risk if these investors decide to sell simultaneously. Recent insider sales add a cautious note. However, the institutional ownership is a strong indicator of confidence from large investors. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to institutional backing, but there is also a notable risk of a price fall if large shareholders exit. The general public owns 37% of the stock, providing some stability. Overall, the probabilities reflect a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a positive movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's significant institutional ownership of 61%, which can be both a positive and negative factor. On one hand, institutional ownership indicates confidence from knowledgeable investors, but on the other hand, it also introduces vulnerability to potential large sell-offs by these institutions. The article also mentions recent insider sales, which can be a negative signal. However, the overall tone of the article is relatively neutral, and the impact of this news on the stock price is uncertain. Considering the mixed signals and the neutral tone, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to the confidence from institutional investors, but also acknowledge a non-trivial risk of the stock price falling if institutions decide to sell. The predictions from other models also show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a price fall. Taking into account the various perspectives, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, recent actions suggest immediate price pressures could exist.
