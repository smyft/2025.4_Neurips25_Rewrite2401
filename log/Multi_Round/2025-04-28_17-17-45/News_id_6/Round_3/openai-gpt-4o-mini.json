A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks were mixed, suggesting no strong bullish or bearish momentum in the sector. A mixed performance can lead to uncertainty among investors. Since Apple Inc. is a key player in the tech sector, its stock price may be influenced by these sector-wide sentiments. However, as Apple often demonstrates resilience and strong performance compared to its peers, the probability of a price rise remains somewhat optimistic, although tempered by the mixed sector performance. Thus, while the overall sector sentiment isn't strongly positive, many investors might still see Apple as a stable choice, leading to a moderate probability of an uptick, but also acknowledging the potential for a down movement due to the mixed nature of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks in general during a specific trading session (late Friday afternoon). The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's mixed performance suggests no clear positive or negative trend for the tech sector as a whole. Since the provided content is severely limited by a paywall and contains no specifics about Apple, it offers very little actionable information for predicting Apple's stock price movement. Given the lack of directional signal and the general nature of the information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome, but also acknowledge a small chance of either a rise or a fall based on broader market sentiment and intra-sector dynamics beyond the limited information provided.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline states that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading.  This is very general and provides no specific information about Apple's performance or outlook.  The fact that the news is categorized as a 'sector update' further suggests that the information is not company-specific. Without further information, it's impossible to determine a higher probability of price increase or decrease for Apple based solely on this headline.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned approximately equal weight, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading, with no specific mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) performance or any significant company-specific news. Given the lack of detailed information and the mixed sector performance, it is difficult to predict a clear direction for AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned as neutral, reflecting the uncertainty and lack of actionable data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks are mixed in late afternoon trading. This suggests a neutral or mixed market sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no specific positive or negative information provided about Apple Inc. in the news headline. Therefore, based on the information given, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price rising or falling is equal, as the market seems to be in a state of equilibrium for tech stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading. Since the article does not provide any specific positive or negative information about Apple Inc., the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral. The mixed performance of the tech sector as a whole suggests that there are both positive and negative factors at play, which may offset each other. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be equal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed performance for tech stocks, as seen in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. Without specific details about Apple Inc.'s individual stock performance, it's challenging to predict precise probabilities. However, as a leading tech stock, Apple's reaction might align with sector trends. The term 'mixed' suggests that there's no clear bullish or bearish sentiment specifically tied to Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Given the mixed performance observed in tech stocks during late Friday afternoon trading, there is a prevailing sentiment of uncertainty surrounding the sector, which includes Apple Inc. As the news does not provide any specific details about Apple's performance or outlook, predictions lean towards a neutral stance. However, Apple's robust history and position in the tech industry provide some resilience against negative market sentiment. Thus, while there is a significant amount of uncertainty, I estimate a slightly higher probability for a price rise compared to a fall, reflecting a belief in Apple's stability amidst sector volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The previous rounds of predictions consistently interpreted the 'mixed' nature of the tech sector news as a neutral signal, leading to probabilities of rising and falling being close to equal (around 0.5 or slightly skewed towards 0.45). While some models acknowledged Apple's potential to outperform, the lack of specific information about Apple in the headline suggests that a major price swing is unlikely. Given this consistency and lack of new information providing insights into Apple's stock, I will follow the trend. As it's the news from late Friday afternoon, I think the chances of a stock rise is relatively less than that of a stock fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news provides limited information, stating only that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading.  This lacks specific information about Apple's performance.  Previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.55 for a price rise and similarly for a price fall.  The general lack of specific news about Apple, coupled with mixed sector performance, points to a relatively neutral outlook. While Apple generally exhibits resilience, the absence of company-specific positive news prevents a significantly higher probability of a price increase.  Therefore, a near-neutral probability is assigned, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the lack of directional information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. However, there is no specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the provided content. Given the mixed sentiment in the tech sector and the lack of company-specific news, it is reasonable to assume a neutral stance on AAPL's stock price movement. The previous predictions also reflect this uncertainty, with most models assigning equal or near-equal probabilities to both a rise and a fall. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced, acknowledging the lack of directional bias in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading. There is no specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the headline. Given the lack of company-specific news and the mixed performance of the tech sector, it's reasonable to assume a neutral stance. The mixed sector performance suggests that there are both positive and negative factors at play, which may offset each other. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be equal, with a slight bias towards a moderate increase due to Apple's historical resilience and strong performance compared to its peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading, suggesting a neutral or mixed market sentiment for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the provided content is limited and contains no specific positive or negative information about Apple, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral. Considering the mixed performance of the tech sector and the lack of actionable information, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be equal. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend of uncertainty and neutrality, which supports this estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading. This suggests that the overall sentiment in the tech sector was neither clearly positive nor negative. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, its stock price might be influenced by the mixed performance of the sector as a whole. Given the lack of specific information about Apple and the mixed performance indicated by the news, it's reasonable to expect a moderate level of uncertainty among investors, leading to a neutral outcome. However, considering historical performance and investor confidence in Apple, there might be a slight bias towards stability or a minor uptick.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Given the mixed performance of tech stocks reported in the news, the general sentiment among investors appears neutral. The lack of specific information about Apple Inc. leaves us without strong indicators for a price movement. While Apple's historical resilience in the market could support a slight bullish sentiment, the overall mixed signals from the sector suggest a balanced outlook for its stock price. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall, while acknowledging the significant uncertainty within the tech sector at this time.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.46, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.54, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks, which provides very little directional information about Apple's specific performance. Previous models have consistently assigned probabilities close to 0.5 for both rising and falling, reflecting the uncertainty. Since the news came late on a Friday afternoon, there might be less immediate reaction. While Apple is a strong company, the absence of specific positive catalysts makes a significant rise unlikely. However, given past rounds had a slight increase to the stock price rising, there is a trend that should prevail this round which is a slightly decreasing rate. Therefore, both probabilities are still set to near 0.5, but the probability of fall is a bit more than rising. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news provides only very general information about the tech sector's mixed performance, offering no specifics on Apple.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly clustered around 0.5 for both rise and fall, reflecting the lack of directional information.  While Apple generally exhibits resilience compared to the broader tech sector, the absence of any company-specific positive news prevents a significantly higher probability of a price increase. The late Friday afternoon timing might slightly increase the probability of a fall, as some investors may lock in gains or take profits before the weekend. Considering the overall uncertainty and the consensus of previous predictions, a near-neutral probability is most appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance in the tech sector, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, but lacks specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models reflect uncertainty, with probabilities for stock price rise and fall ranging from near-equal to slightly skewed. Given the lack of company-specific news and the mixed sector performance, it's reasonable to maintain a neutral stance with a slight bias towards stability, considering Apple's historical resilience. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced, acknowledging the neutral market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were mixed in late Friday afternoon trading. There is no specific information provided about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would suggest a clear direction for its stock price. Given the mixed performance of the tech sector and the lack of company-specific news, it's reasonable to assume a neutral stance. The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be nearly equal, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's historical resilience and strong performance compared to its peers.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed performance for tech stocks, which suggests a neutral sentiment in the sector. Given the lack of specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the news, it's reasonable to assume that the impact on its stock price will be neutral. The previous predictions from other models show a trend of uncertainty and neutrality, with probabilities ranging from 0.4 to 0.55 for a price rise and similarly for a price fall. Considering Apple's historical resilience and strong performance compared to its peers, there might be a slight bias towards stability or a minor uptick. However, the overall mixed sector performance and lack of actionable information lead to a neutral estimation of the stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance for tech stocks in late afternoon trading. Without specific information about Apple Inc., the impact on the stock price is uncertain. Previous predictions suggest a neutral outlook with a slight bias towards a rise, but there's growing sentiment toward a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the mixed sector performance and end-of-week trading dynamics. Apple's resilience should be considered, but the overall neutral tone of the news leans towards a cautious approach.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
