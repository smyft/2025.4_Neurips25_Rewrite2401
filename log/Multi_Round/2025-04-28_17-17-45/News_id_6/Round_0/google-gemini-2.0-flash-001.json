The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's mixed performance suggests no clear positive or negative trend for the tech sector as a whole. Since the provided content is severely limited by a paywall and contains no specifics about Apple, it offers very little actionable information for predicting Apple's stock price movement. Given the lack of directional signal and the general nature of the information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome, but also acknowledge a small chance of either a rise or a fall based on broader market sentiment and intra-sector dynamics beyond the limited information provided.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Sector Update: Tech Stocks Mixed in Late Afternoon\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
