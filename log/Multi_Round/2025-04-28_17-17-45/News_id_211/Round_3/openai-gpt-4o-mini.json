      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Meta's plans to introduce new smart glasses, a smartwatch, and AI-integrated earbuds, which could pose competition to Apple's existing products such as the Apple Watch and AirPods. Although innovation from competitors can sometimes signal a vibrant market, it can also create anxiety for investors regarding potential market share losses. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and product ecosystem may mitigate immediate concerns over competition. Thus, while competition is increasing, the overall sentiment may not significantly harm Apple's stock price in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability of price rise due to sustained consumer interest and brand strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Meta is planning to release new competitive wearable products such as smart watches, camera-equipped earbuds and smart glasses that will compete directly with Apple's existing product portfolio, including Apple Watch and AirPods. While Meta has made large investments, they have yet to achieve broad consumer appeal, which might lead some investors to believe that the competitive pressure on Apple is limited. On the other hand, the fact that multiple companies (including Samsung) are trying to compete with Apple in the earbud space could be viewed negatively and may drive the stock down. Considering these countervailing perspectives, the net effect on the stock price is likely to be slightly negative. It is also important to note that Apple has also reported exploring the idea of incorporating cameras on earbuds. Although Apple is a well-diversified company and derives revenue from many sources, this specific news highlights potential threats to a key revenue stream within its wearable segment. Hence, I believe the stock price is likely to have a slight dip from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into the wearable technology market, specifically smart glasses, watches, and earbuds.  While this is a competitive threat to Apple in the smartwatch and AirPods markets, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Meta's previous ventures in this space haven't achieved widespread adoption, and the timeline for many of these new products is several years out. The news primarily highlights Meta's ambition and strategy, rather than a significant immediate threat to Apple's market position.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to *this specific news* is relatively low. Any market movement is more likely to be influenced by other factors, such as overall market trends, Apple's own product releases, or broader economic conditions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline reports Meta's plans to expand into wearable technology, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could compete with Apple's existing products like the Apple Watch and AirPods. While this indicates potential increased competition for Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term because: 1) Apple has a strong brand loyalty and market share in wearables, 2) Meta's products are still in development or early stages, and 3) Apple is also exploring similar innovations (e.g., camera-equipped earbuds). The news does not directly affect Apple's current financial performance or product pipeline. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms Inc. planning to release Oakley-branded glasses, exploring watches and earbuds, indicates an increased competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the wearable technology market. Meta's move into smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds directly challenges Apple's product lineup, including AirPods and the Apple Watch. This competitive threat could potentially impact Apple's sales and market share in the wearables segment. However, considering Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and historical resilience to competitive threats, the immediate impact might be moderate. The probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be lower due to increased competition, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher but not significantly so, given the company's solid fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. However, the article does not provide any direct indication of how this competition will affect Apple's stock price. The success of Meta's new products is uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including consumer acceptance and market trends. Given the uncertainty and the fact that Apple is a well-established company with a diverse range of products, the probability of a significant impact on its stock price is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Meta Platforms Inc.'s plans to expand its smart glasses line, including Oakley-branded glasses for athletes, and explore new wearable devices such as watches and earbuds. These efforts are likely intended to position Meta as an AI and VR/AR innovation leader, potentially competing directly with Apple's smartwatch and AirPods. This could be seen as competitive pressure on Apple, which might negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple's stock. However, it also signals growth in the wearable tech arena, which could be positive for all players in the market. Given these dynamics, the news is more likely to have a minor negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Meta's plans to develop new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, signals increased competition for Apple's products like the Apple Watch and AirPods. This competition may create some anxiety within investor sentiment regarding potential market share losses, as Meta aims to position itself as a leader in AI and wearable technology. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, established product ecosystem, and ongoing innovation could mitigate significant immediate impacts. Given that most competing products from Meta are still in development, the likelihood of an immediate negative effect on Apple's stock price is somewhat limited. Hence, I estimate a slight tilt towards a price decline but not a drastic drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's increased competition in the wearables market, directly challenging Apple's dominant position in smartwatches and earbuds. This competitive pressure has been consistently viewed as a slightly negative signal for Apple's stock in previous rounds. Although Apple has brand loyalty and a robust ecosystem, the potential for market share erosion exists. The models from the previous round show a slight trend towards negative outlook, and given more context of increasing competition being a consistent theme, I would tend to agree that there is more uncertainty around APPLE being able to maintain its current standing within the earbud and smartwatch market. I will slightly increase the rate of falling because the trend in the previous round is more towards the stock falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news about Meta's expansion into wearable technology presents a mixed bag for Apple. While increased competition in the smart glasses, smartwatch, and earbud markets is a potential threat, the impact is likely to be muted.  Meta's track record in wearables hasn't been spectacular, and the timeline for many of their new product releases is relatively distant.  Apple's strong brand loyalty, extensive product ecosystem, and ongoing innovations (as evidenced by their own exploration of camera-equipped earbuds) mitigate the negative impact significantly.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean toward a negative impact, but none suggest a drastic change.  Considering the long-term nature of the Meta announcements and Apple's overall strength, the short-term impact on AAPL is unlikely to be substantial.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but still relatively close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Meta's aggressive expansion into wearable technology, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which directly competes with Apple's product lines. While this introduces competitive pressure, Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and market dominance in wearables mitigate immediate concerns. Additionally, Meta's products are still in development or early stages, and their success is uncertain. The news might cause mild negative sentiment but is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Previous predictions suggest a cautious outlook, with most models leaning slightly towards a negative impact due to competitive threats but acknowledging Apple's resilience.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news highlights Meta's plans to introduce new smart glasses, a smartwatch, and AI-integrated earbuds, which could pose competition to Apple's existing products such as the Apple Watch and AirPods. While this indicates potential increased competition for Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term because: 1) Apple has a strong brand loyalty and market share in wearables, 2) Meta's products are still in development or early stages, and 3) Apple is also exploring similar innovations (e.g., camera-equipped earbuds). The news does not directly affect Apple's current financial performance or product pipeline. However, considering the competitive landscape and the historical resilience of Apple's stock to such threats, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to investor caution, but still a significant likelihood of stability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. However, considering Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and historical resilience to competitive threats, the immediate impact might be moderate. The success of Meta's new products is uncertain, and the impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including consumer acceptance and market trends. Given the uncertainty and the fact that Apple is a well-established company with a diverse range of products, the probability of a significant impact on its stock price is relatively low. Other models' predictions indicate a range of opinions, from a slight negative impact to a minimal effect, with probabilities of stock price rise and fall varying accordingly. Taking into account the competitive pressure and Apple's strengths, a balanced estimation is appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Meta's plans to develop a range of smart wearable devices including smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds. While this presents increased competition for Apple in the wearable market, particularly with its AirPods and Apple Watch, several factors need to be considered. Apple's strong brand loyalty, robust product ecosystem, and diversification across various tech segments suggest resilience against such competitive threats. Additionally, Apple has also been exploring similar technological advancements, which could counterbalance some of the competitive pressures. However, investor sentiment might remain cautious due to the potential immediate impact on specific product lines. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate, but given the uncertainty around the successful market penetration of Meta's products and the historical performance of Apple against competitive threats, the probability of both rising and falling remain balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about Meta's plans to develop new wearable devices introduces increased competition for Apple from a major rival, particularly in the smartwatch and earbud segments. While the potential pressure on Apple's market share could lead to negative sentiment among investors, it is essential to consider Apple's strong brand loyalty, vast ecosystem, and ongoing innovation initiatives that may mitigate the impact of such competition. Previous analyses suggest a slight bias towards a price decline due to heightened competition, but most predictions also emphasize that the immediate effects on Apple's stock price will likely be minimal, given that Meta's products are still in development stages. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news highlights Meta's continued push into the wearable tech space, directly challenging Apple's strongholds in smartwatches and earbuds. While previous rounds have consistently pointed towards potential negative sentiment due to increased competition, the models also acknowledge Apple's strengths - brand loyalty, a robust ecosystem, and ongoing innovation. Considering the trend of previous estimations leaning towards a negative impact, I will stay consistent with that direction but recognizing a slight recovery from yesterday based on positive signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Meta's expansion into wearable technology presents a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the smartwatch and earbuds markets.  However, the impact is likely to be limited in the short term.  Meta's past ventures in wearables haven't achieved widespread success, and their new products are still several years away from release for many items.

The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight overall lean towards a negative impact, but none predict a drastic change. Considering the long-term nature of Meta's announcements and Apple's overall strength, the immediate effect on AAPL's stock price is unlikely to be substantial. The consensus leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to increased competition, but the magnitude is likely to be small. The probability is adjusted from previous predictions reflecting the uncertainty and the long timeframe before meaningful competition materializes.  The relatively high cost of potential new Meta products and the uncertainty of success mitigate the threat.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Meta's plans to expand into wearable technology, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could compete with Apple's existing products like the Apple Watch and AirPods.
