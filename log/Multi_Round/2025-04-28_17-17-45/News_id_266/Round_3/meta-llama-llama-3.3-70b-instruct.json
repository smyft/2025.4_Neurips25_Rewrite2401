(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Microsoft\u2019s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's recent 4% drop reflects growing concerns over iPhone sales and specific challenges in the Chinese market. The company's 8% decline year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq's modest gain, indicates weakening investor sentiment. The surrounding market context, particularly Microsoft's struggles with AI adoption and its implications for tech stocks, may affect broader sector performance. Given these factors, despite some recovery seen on Friday, the outlook remains cautious. The risk of further declines in Apple's stock, due to ongoing market pressures and performance concerns, appears more pronounced than the potential for significant gains at this time.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their slow adoption rate, which is negatively affecting their stock performance compared to other tech giants. The article highlights concerns about ambitious spending, tepid growth forecast for Azure, and less popularity of Microsoft's AI services compared to competitors. However, the news also mentions positive aspects like a 30% price hike for Office apps, strong analyst ratings with a buy recommendation from over 90% of analysts, and an average analyst price target pointing to a nearly 20% upside. Bank of America names Microsoft as a top pick for the AI cycle, and UBS has a positive outlook expecting AI monetization to improve sharply in 2025. In the long term, analysts expect revenue and earnings to continue to expand. The Apple stock information included at the end of the article does not pertain to Microsoft's stock price movement. While short-term headwinds and increased spending exist, analyst sentiment and long term forecasts are positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Microsoft's struggles with AI adoption and its impact on their stock price.  While it mentions Apple's recent 4% drop, this is primarily attributed to concerns over iPhone sales and the Chinese market, not directly related to Microsoft's AI performance.  The Apple stock price drop is presented as a separate, independent event. Therefore, the news about Microsoft is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of Apple's stock price moving, either up or down, due to this specific news is low.  However, given the overall market volatility and the pre-existing concerns about Apple's performance (mentioned in the article),  a slight probability of a fall is assigned. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Microsoft's AI investments and their impact on its stock performance, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding a recent 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given that the news is not directly about Apple and the mention is negative (highlighting sales concerns and market weakness), it is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. The broader market sentiment around tech stocks and AI may indirectly affect Apple, but the direct relevance is limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Microsoft's AI investments and their impact on its stock performance. While the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it focuses on the challenges faced by Microsoft (MSFT) in realizing returns on its AI investments, which could have indirect implications for Apple, given its position in the tech industry. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from Microsoft's AI investment struggles and stock performance is limited. The article mentions Apple's stock drop and concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market but does not provide a clear connection between Microsoft's AI challenges and Apple's stock movement. Given this, the estimated probabilities of Apple's stock price movement are based on general market sentiment and the information provided about Apple's recent stock performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Microsoft's investments in artificial intelligence and its impact on the company's stock price. However, the question asks about the stock price movement of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article does mention Apple Inc., stating that it fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August, and that it has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Since the article's main focus is on Microsoft and not Apple, and it does not provide a direct positive or negative outlook for Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are based on the general market and economic conditions. Given the lack of direct information about Apple's future performance in the article, the probabilities are more neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Microsoft related to the adoption and monetization of AI services, which are impacting investor confidence and stock performance negatively. Despite positive long-term forecasts and analyst recommendations, near-term concerns around slower-than-expected AI service uptake and competitive pressures from rivals like Google and Meta are prominent. This suggests increased volatility and potentially downward pressure on the stock price in the short term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Microsoft's struggles with AI investments and its stock performance, which may create nervousness in the tech sector overall. Apple's recent 4% drop highlights its specific challenges with iPhone sales, particularly in the Chinese market, and is indicative of broader investor concerns within the tech industry. Given the negative sentiment surrounding both Apple and Microsoft, and the limited direct correlation between Microsoft's AI struggles and Apple's performance, I assess a higher probability of Apple's stock continuing to face downward pressure. The overall market sentiment in tech, influenced by Microsoft's situation, contributes to a pessimistic outlook for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and challenges, but it also mentions Apple's recent stock performance woes due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. While the main narrative revolves around Microsoft, the explicit mention of Apple's struggles acts as a bearish signal. The previous predictions show a trend towards negative sentiment, with most models assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall. Considering this context, I believe the probability of Apple's stock falling remains elevated, even though the news isn't directly about Apple's core business.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Microsoft's challenges with AI adoption and its impact on its stock price.  While it mentions Apple's recent 4% drop due to concerns about iPhone sales and the Chinese market, this is presented as a separate issue. There's no direct causal link established between Microsoft's AI struggles and Apple's stock movement.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean toward a fall. Considering the negative sentiment surrounding Apple (weak iPhone sales, Chinese market weakness), coupled with the generally cautious outlook on the tech sector given Microsoft's struggles (which could spill over), I assign a higher probability to a stock price fall.  However, the lack of direct connection in the news means the probabilities remain relatively neutral compared to predictions based on directly relevant news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their impact on its stock performance, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding a recent 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given that the news is not directly about Apple and the mention is negative (highlighting sales concerns and market weakness), it is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. The broader market sentiment around tech stocks and AI may indirectly affect Apple, but the direct relevance is limited. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news article primarily discusses Microsoft's AI investments and their slow adoption rate, which negatively impacts their stock performance. Apple's stock is mentioned briefly, noting a recent 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. However, there is no direct link between Microsoft's AI challenges and Apple's stock movement. Given the lack of direct information about Apple's future performance and considering the existing concerns about iPhone sales and the Chinese market, the probabilities are skewed towards a cautious outlook. The recent drop and year-to-date underperformance compared to the Nasdaq 100 Index suggest that the risk of further declines is more pronounced than the potential for significant gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article primarily discusses Microsoft's AI investments and their impact on its stock performance. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its recent stock drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, the news does not directly affect Apple's stock price. Given the indirect implications and the overall market sentiment, I estimate the probabilities of Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Microsoft's AI investments and current market struggles, including tepid adoption rates and competitive pressures. Although there is a brief mention of Apple's recent stock decline due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, the direct impact of Microsoft's situation on Apple's stock price is limited. Analysts show mixed views but lean towards caution for Microsoft. For Apple, the news reinforces existing concerns rather than introduces new ones. Overall, the news has a limited impact on Apple\u2019s immediate stock price trends.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Microsoft's struggles with AI adoption and its impact on their stock. Apple Inc.'s mention highlights ongoing concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, which have recently contributed to its stock decline. While the news is indirectly related to Apple, the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the specific challenges faced by Apple indicate a higher probability for the stock to fall. Recent drops and underperformance compared to the Nasdaq suggest further downward pressure. Overall, the sentiment surrounding tech stocks appears to weigh more heavily on Apple, leading to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article mainly focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and challenges, with a brief mention of Apple's stock drop due to iPhone sales concerns in China. While Microsoft's struggles might indirectly influence overall tech sentiment, the most direct impact on Apple stems from its own specific issues. Considering this and the trend in previous predictions leaning towards a likely fall, the probability of Apple's stock falling slightly outweighs the rise. The positive recovery recorded by Apple on Friday is considered a slight counteracting evidence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Microsoft's challenges with AI adoption and its impact on its stock price.  Apple is mentioned only briefly, with its recent 4% drop attributed to concerns about iPhone sales and the Chinese market.  There's no direct causal link between Microsoft's AI struggles and Apple's stock movement. While the overall market sentiment around tech stocks might indirectly affect Apple, the direct relevance of the Microsoft news to Apple is low.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of Apple's stock falling, largely due to the pre-existing concerns about iPhone sales and the Chinese market.  These concerns, combined with the general negative sentiment in the tech sector (even if indirectly related), support a higher probability of a price fall. However, given the limited direct connection, the probabilities are not as extreme as some previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their impact on its stock performance, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc.
