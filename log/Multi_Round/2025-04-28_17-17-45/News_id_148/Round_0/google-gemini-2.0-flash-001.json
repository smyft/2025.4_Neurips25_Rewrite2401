While it doesn't specifically mention Apple, the broader sector weakness suggests negative pressure. However, the limited information available (due to the paywall) prevents a detailed analysis of the severity and specific causes of the tech stock fall. Given the general market movement against the tech sector, and the limited information in the article, it's probable Apple's stock price will fall to some degree. I'm assigning a higher probability to a fall, but Apple is a strong company often outperforming market trends. The full article may have more information, but based solely on the headline, the negative effect on the stock is more likely than a rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Sector Update: Tech Stocks Fall Late Afternoon\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
