A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including Apple's, are generally declining. A late afternoon dip in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund suggests a negative sentiment affecting the sector. Given that Apple's stock often correlates with broader tech trends, it is likely that AAPL will experience a decrease in price in response to this sector-wide downturn. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in tech stocks towards the end of the trading day. While it doesn't specifically mention Apple, the broader sector weakness suggests negative pressure. However, the limited information available (due to the paywall) prevents a detailed analysis of the severity and specific causes of the tech stock fall. Given the general market movement against the tech sector, and the limited information in the article, it's probable Apple's stock price will fall to some degree. I'm assigning a higher probability to a fall, but Apple is a strong company often outperforming market trends. The full article may have more information, but based solely on the headline, the negative effect on the stock is more likely than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) falling.  Since Apple is a major technology company, it's likely to be affected by this broader market trend.  However, without access to the full news article's content,  we cannot assess any specifics that might mitigate this negative influence.  Therefore, we assume a higher probability of a price fall based solely on the headline and the general negative sentiment toward the tech sector.  The probabilities presented below reflect this uncertainty and the lack of detailed information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were falling late Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely influenced by sector-wide trends. Given the negative sentiment in the tech sector, it is reasonable to infer that AAPL's stock price may also experience downward pressure. However, without additional details from the premium content, the analysis is limited to the general sector movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including Apple's sector, are experiencing a decline late in the afternoon. This suggests a negative trend for tech stocks, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news specifically mentions the decline of tech stocks, it is reasonable to infer that Apple's stock price is likely to be negatively affected. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks were falling late in the afternoon, which includes Apple Inc. as it is a major technology company. Given the overall decline in the tech sector, it is reasonable to assume that Apple's stock price might also be negatively affected. However, without specific details on Apple's performance or any company-specific news, the impact might be moderate. Thus, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising due to the general sector decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole are facing decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this overall market sentiment. However, the news alone does not provide specific details about Apple's individual performance but rather sets an overarching context. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood for Apple's stock price to fall alongside the broader sector, but it could also demonstrate resilience due to its strong fundamentals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Given the overarching trend in the tech sector indicated by the news, where tech stocks including Apple's are facing a decline, it is reasonable to conclude that Apple's stock price is also likely to decline. The predictions from various models suggest a consistent negative sentiment regarding the stock's performance due to sector-wide pressures. This leads to a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling compared to rising. There lacks specific positive news about Apple that could counter the sector's downturn.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative trend in the tech sector. The previous rounds of predictions consistently skewed towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this sector-wide decline. Considering the consensus from previous models and the lack of company-specific positive news, I will maintain a similar, albeit slightly adjusted, stance. The adjustment reflects ongoing market dynamics and inherent uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, impacting the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK).  Apple, as a major tech company, is highly susceptible to sector-wide movements.  While the lack of specific Apple-related news prevents a precise prediction, the prevailing negative sentiment strongly suggests a higher probability of a price drop.  Previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of a fall, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8.  Considering this consensus and the limited positive information, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a fall than the average of the previous models to account for the sector-wide negative trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in tech stocks, specifically mentioning the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a major component. Previous predictions from multiple models suggest a consensus that Apple's stock price is likely to fall due to the negative sector-wide sentiment, with probabilities ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for a fall and 0.2 to 0.3 for a rise. Given the lack of specific positive news about Apple and the broader tech sector decline, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to a price fall. However, Apple's strong fundamentals might provide some resilience, slightly offsetting the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in tech stocks, as reflected by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK). Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, it is likely that the stock will experience downward pressure. Multiple predictions from various models suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising, with probabilities of a fall ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 and probabilities of a rise ranging from 0.2 to 0.3. Considering the broad sector decline and Apple's significant presence in the tech industry, the consensus leans towards a higher chance of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a decline in tech stocks, and since Apple Inc. is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this trend. The lack of specific details about Apple's performance in the news, combined with the overall negative sector sentiment, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. Taking into account the broad sector decline and the potential for Apple's resilience due to its strong fundamentals, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole face decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Given Apple's significant presence in the tech sector, it is likely to be negatively influenced by this market sentiment. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of stock price falling due to the sector-wide downturn, with probabilities ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Although Apple is a strong company that can potentially outperform sector trends, the provided news lacks detailed information about specific factors that might mitigate the negative influence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
