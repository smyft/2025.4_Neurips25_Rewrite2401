Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view on Apple Inc.'s stock. While it highlights Apple's success and potential with investments in AI and steady dividend growth, it also cautions about high valuation metrics compared to historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary products. The strong past performance may not guarantee future gains, making investors wary. Given this mixed sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be moderate, while the potential for a fall due to overvaluation is also significant.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view on Apple's stock. While highlighting its strong financial performance, market dominance, AI investments, dividend payouts, and share buybacks (all bullish indicators), it also emphasizes the high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, P/CF ratios are above their 5-year averages), and the lack of revolutionary new products lately (bearish indicators). The article explicitly mentions the stock being possibly overvalued and points to historical performance as a reason for caution, given that impressive year-to-year growth won't necessarily continue to hold. The author suggests cautious investment strategies. The 'Double Down' ad suggests a bullish sentiment, but this seems like a boiler plate marketing section. On balance, the slightly negative framing of the headline and emphasis on valuation make a slight downward movement more likely, while the mention of \"Apple Intelligence\" and consistent investment into AI could provide bullish moments. Overall, the article introduces uncertainty and doesn't clearly skew in either direction, the title could make a cautious investor consider selling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current market position and future prospects.  While highlighting Apple's impressive revenue, profitability, and investments in AI, it also emphasizes concerns about its high valuation.  The article points out that Apple's price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-cash flow ratios are significantly higher than their five-year averages, suggesting the stock may be overvalued.  The lack of recent revolutionary product introductions is another potential downside mentioned.  However, the article also acknowledges Apple's strong financial health, dividend payments, and share buybacks as positive factors.  Overall, the article leans towards caution, advising investors to consider their risk tolerance and potentially wait for a more attractive entry point.  Given this balanced perspective and the inherent uncertainty in the stock market, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a relatively neutral outlook with a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the overvaluation concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, investment in AI, dividend growth, and share buybacks suggest potential for continued growth. However, the article also points out concerns regarding Apple's high valuation metrics (e.g., P/E, PSR) compared to historical averages, which could indicate overvaluation. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product launches and the challenge of sustaining high growth as a multi-trillion-dollar company are noted as risks. Given these mixed signals, the stock's movement is likely to be influenced by investor sentiment towards valuation and future growth prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses both positive and negative factors influencing Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple is investing heavily in AI, has a strong financial position, and a history of growth. However, the article also highlights that Apple's valuation is high compared to its historical averages, which could lead to a stock price correction. The article concludes that while Apple is likely to continue growing, its high valuation suggests that the stock price may not rise as sharply as in the past. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 55% and the probability of the stock price falling as 45%.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as the largest company in the world, with a market value of $3.68 trillion. It highlights both reasons to invest in Apple, such as its heavy investment in artificial intelligence and its dividend-paying history, and reasons to be cautious, such as its high valuation metrics. The article also mentions that Apple hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its future growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling due to the high valuation and potential for a correction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the world's largest company with strong financial metrics and a track record of impressive performance. However, the valuation multiples suggest the stock is currently priced high relative to its earnings and cash flows, which could indicate a higher risk of price correction. While the company's financial health and consistent growth are supportive factors, the lack of revolutionary new products and potential overvaluation pose risks. The analyst's caution and mention of other undervalued opportunities further suggest a mixed outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view on Apple's stock performance, acknowledging strong financial metrics and future growth potential through investments in AI. However, it also emphasizes concerns regarding Apple's high valuation ratios compared to historical averages and the lack of new revolutionary products, suggesting caution for investors. Given this mixed sentiment and the overall trends from previous predictions indicating a slightly greater likelihood of a price fall due to overvaluation, I am estimating a higher probability for the stock price to fall despite positive growth indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's stock (AAPL). Positive aspects include its heavy investment in AI ('Apple Intelligence'), consistent dividend increases, and share buybacks. However, the article emphasizes concerns about Apple's high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, P/CF ratios) relative to their 5-year averages suggesting potential overvaluation, and the absence of revolutionary new product recently. Prior rounds' estimated probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall, with a lot of the models indicating cautious investors and/or the overvaluation as a drag on prices. The consensus is that while Apple is promising, its high valuation poses a risk. Considering the prior predictions leaning slightly negative due to valuation concerns, I'll maintain a similar viewpoint with a slight emphasis on a fall, acknowledging the AI investment as a potential offset albeit not immediate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative factors.  The positive factors include strong financials, investment in AI, dividend payouts, and share buybacks.  However, the significant concern is the high valuation, with key metrics (P/E, P/S, P/CF) significantly above their five-year averages. This overvaluation suggests a potential for a price correction. The absence of recent revolutionary products also adds to the uncertainty. While the AI investments offer future potential, their impact on short-term stock price is unclear.  Considering the previous predictions, which lean slightly towards a price fall due to overvaluation concerns, and the article's cautious tone, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  The past impressive growth rates are unlikely to be sustainable for a company of Apple's size and valuation.  The \"Double Down\" advertisement is disregarded as biased marketing.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple Inc., highlighting both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, investment in AI, and consistent dividend growth are factors that could support stock price stability or growth. However, the article also emphasizes concerns regarding Apple's high valuation metrics (e.g., P/E, PSR) compared to historical averages, which could indicate overvaluation and lead to a price correction. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product launches and the challenge of sustaining high growth as a multi-trillion-dollar company are noted risks. Given these mixed signals, the stock's movement is likely to be influenced by investor sentiment towards valuation and future growth prospects, with a slightly higher probability of a fall due to overvaluation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current market position and future prospects. While it highlights Apple's strong financial performance, market dominance, investments in AI, dividend payouts, and share buybacks as positive factors, it also emphasizes concerns about high valuation metrics compared to historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary products. The article suggests that while Apple is likely to continue growing, its high valuation could lead to a stock price correction. Considering these mixed signals and the cautious tone of the article, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current market position and future prospects, highlighting both positive and negative aspects.

Considering the mixed signals and the emphasis on caution due to high valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling. The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of a price fall around 0.55. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.45 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.55.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the world's largest company with strong financial metrics and a track record of impressive performance, which contributes to a bullish sentiment. However, it also points out elevated valuation metrics such as high P/E, P/S, and P/C ratios, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. Additionally, it mentions the lack of revolutionary new products and potential overvaluation risks. Although there are positive aspects like strong financial health and investments in AI, the overarching cautionary tone and mixed signals seem to tilt the sentiment slightly towards caution.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis reveals a nuanced outlook for Apple Inc. Despite strong financial metrics, including high revenue and profitability, the company's elevated valuation ratios (P/S, P/E, P/CF) compared to their historical averages indicate potential overvaluation risks. The article highlights the lack of recent revolutionary products, which raises concerns about sustaining growth at such a high valuation. While investments in AI and a growing dividend are positive factors, the cautious tone of the article suggests a stronger likelihood of stock price declines as investors weigh potential corrections. Therefore, the probability assigned reflects a greater chance of a fall based on these valuation concerns and market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's future stock performance. Positive aspects include its ongoing investments in AI, consistent dividend growth, and general financial health. These factors contribute towards a potential increase in stock price. However, the article emphasizes high valuation metrics compared to historical averages and a lack of recent revolutionary product launches, suggesting caution and increasing the probability of a price correction or a fall. Previous models have leaned slightly towards a higher chance of price decrease due to concerns about overvaluation. Hence, considering these factors will likely cause the stock to be bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative factors.  Positive factors include strong financials, investment in AI, dividend payouts, and share buybacks. However, the high valuation metrics (P/E, P/S, P/CF ratios significantly above their five-year averages) are a major concern, suggesting potential overvaluation and a risk of price correction. The lack of recent revolutionary product introductions also adds uncertainty.  The previous predictions consistently show a leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall (around 0.55 on average) primarily due to overvaluation concerns. While the AI investments offer future potential, their short-term impact is unclear. Considering the consistent negative sentiment from previous predictions and the significant overvaluation concerns highlighted in the article, I assign a higher probability to a price fall.  The past impressive growth rates are unlikely to be sustained at Apple's current size and valuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's current market position, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Positive factors include strong financial health, investments in AI, and consistent dividend growth. Negative factors include high valuation metrics compared to historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary products, suggesting potential overvaluation and caution for investors. Given this mixed sentiment and the trends from previous predictions indicating a slight bias towards a price fall, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to fall despite the positive indicators.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current market position and future prospects, highlighting both positive and negative aspects.
