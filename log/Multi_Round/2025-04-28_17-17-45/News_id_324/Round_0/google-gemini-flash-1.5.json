However, the news itself is retrospective; it explains past performance, not future prospects.  While positive investor sentiment is a bullish indicator, it doesn't guarantee future price increases.  Past performance is never a guarantee of future results.  There are always inherent risks in the stock market. The lack of specific information about the drivers of the anticipated growth makes it difficult to assign a high probability to a price increase.
