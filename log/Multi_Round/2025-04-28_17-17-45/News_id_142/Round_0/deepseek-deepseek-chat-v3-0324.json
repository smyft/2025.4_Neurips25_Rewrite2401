This could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth potential or a strategic shift towards higher-growth sectors like AI. Such actions by high-profile investors can influence market sentiment. However, Apple is a large, well-established company with a diversified product line and strong financials, so the impact of a single investor's decision may be limited. The probabilities reflect a slight negative bias due to the news but acknowledge Apple's resilience.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
