      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news headline indicates that billionaire Steven Cohen sold Apple stock. While Cohen's investment decisions can influence market sentiment, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be small given Apple's large market capitalization and overall company strength.  The news focuses more on Cohen's investment in a different AI company, which is not related to Apple. Therefore, the headline provides little to no direct information relevant to Apple's intrinsic value or future performance.  The sale of stock by a single investor, even a prominent one, is not usually a significant factor in moving the price of a major company's stock unless it's part of a larger trend.  The probability of price movement in either direction is therefore likely close to the baseline likelihood of price changes on any given day.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
