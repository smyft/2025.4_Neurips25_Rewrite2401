This could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, it's also possible that Cohen's decision is based on his own portfolio rebalancing and not necessarily a reflection of Apple's intrinsic value or future prospects. Given that Steven Cohen's actions can influence market sentiment, the news might lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Nonetheless, Apple's strong brand, financials, and continuous innovation might offset negative sentiments, limiting the downside potential.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
