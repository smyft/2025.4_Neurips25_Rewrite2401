The sale of Apple stock by a prominent investor could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple's stock price. However, the overall impact also depends on the size of the sale relative to Cohen's portfolio and Apple's market dynamics. Given that the news specifically highlights the sale of Apple stock, it might increase the likelihood of a stock price fall. Nevertheless, Apple's strong market presence and investor confidence could mitigate the negative impact.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
