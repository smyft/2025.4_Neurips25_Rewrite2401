A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights that Nvidia has overtaken Apple in market capitalization, which could indicate a weakening confidence in Apple's competitiveness in the tech sector, especially with the ongoing boom in AI led by Nvidia. Additionally, AAPL shares fell 3% in the previous session, suggesting some existing negative sentiment. While Apple remains a strong company, the immediate effect of Nvidia's rise and the general bullish sentiment around AI may not favor AAPL in the short term. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling relative to the chance of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company. This suggests negative sentiment toward Apple, potentially leading to further price decline. While Apple is mentioned in other news, such as companies 'in the news' on Wednesday, the overall tone is not favorable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  While Apple's stock fell 3% the previous session, this article doesn't provide any specific information that directly impacts Apple's future performance. The positive news for Nvidia and the overall AI sector might create a slightly negative sentiment for Apple in the short term, as investors shift focus to other companies.  However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price from this news is expected to be relatively minor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights that Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. The news also mentions a significant investment in AI infrastructure, which benefits Nvidia and other tech partners but does not directly favor Apple. Given that Apple's market capitalization has been surpassed and its shares fell recently, the sentiment around Apple in this context appears neutral to slightly negative. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and ecosystem may mitigate some downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content mention several companies, but the specific impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is that Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This indicates a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price due to the comparative performance of Nvidia. However, the overall market and sector performance could influence Apple's stock price movement. Given the information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling in the short term due to the direct comparison and Nvidia's surge, but the probabilities also consider the broader market context and potential for recovery.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news mentions that Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Nvidia's market capitalization at $3.45tn and Apple's at $3.35tn. This change in market capitalization ranking, combined with the 3% fall in Apple's shares in the previous session, suggests a potential downward trend for Apple's stock price. Additionally, the news highlights Nvidia's involvement in the 'Stargate Project' and the positive impact on the AI sector, which may further contribute to Apple's relative decline. However, it's essential to consider that Apple's stock price can be influenced by various factors, including its own financial performance, industry trends, and overall market conditions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on other companies and does not have direct impacts on Apple's stock performance. However, Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session, and the surrounding news around Nvidia could potentially influence investor sentiment negatively if Nvidia continues to outperform. Still, the factors affecting Apple are not explicitly mentioned in this news.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant development where Nvidia has overtaken Apple in market capitalization, signaling a shift in investor confidence. Apple's shares fell 3% in the previous session, reflecting existing negative sentiment. The focus on Nvidia's growth and investment in AI contrasts with Apple's current standing, which may lead investors to be wary of Apple's competitive position in the tech sector. While Apple's strong fundamentals may provide some cushion, the immediate impact from this news appears more negative. Thus, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling short-term, though there could be opportunities for recovery in the medium to long-term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization, and Apple's stock falling 3% in the previous session. This indicates negative momentum. While Apple is mentioned in the context of other companies, the overall sentiment is not favorable. Previous models mostly leaned towards a higher probability of the stock falling. Considering the previous predictions and the current context, the negative pressure on Apple's stock seems significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's surge and its overtaking of Apple in market capitalization.  While this is negative for Apple's relative standing, it doesn't directly address Apple's fundamentals or future prospects.  The 3% drop in AAPL the previous session is a key factor suggesting existing negative sentiment.  However,  Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio could mitigate the negative impact of this news.  Considering the previous predictions leaning towards a higher probability of a fall, but with some also giving it  a relatively small chance of rising, I temper the negative sentiment somewhat.  The lack of specific news directly affecting Apple leads me to a prediction closer to neutrality, with a slight tilt towards a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple in the short term, especially with the focus on AI and Nvidia's involvement in the 'Stargate Project'. While Apple remains a strong company with solid fundamentals, the immediate impact of this news and the comparative performance of Nvidia may lead to a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling. The lack of direct positive news for Apple in this context further supports this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This change in market capitalization ranking, combined with the recent stock price decline, suggests a potential downward trend for Apple's stock price. The positive sentiment around Nvidia and the AI sector may further contribute to Apple's relative decline. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and ecosystem may mitigate some downside risk. Considering the comparative performance and the overall market context, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news highlights Nvidia overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This indicates a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price due to the comparative performance of Nvidia. However, considering the overall market and sector performance, as well as Apple's strong fundamentals and ecosystem, the probabilities should reflect a balance between the immediate negative sentiment and the potential for recovery or stability. Given the information and the trend of others' predictions, which seem to lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. Yet, the difference should not be overly skewed, as Apple's inherent value and market position still support a significant chance of the stock price stabilizing or rising in response to various market factors.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. The news emphasizes the success of AI-focused companies like Nvidia, which could lead to shifts in investor sentiment. Several models predict a higher probability of stock price falling due to the recent performance and relative competitive position of Apple. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and ongoing innovations may provide some support against a significant decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
