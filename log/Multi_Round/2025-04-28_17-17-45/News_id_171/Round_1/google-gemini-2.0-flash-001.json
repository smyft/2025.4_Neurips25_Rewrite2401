(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\nNews Content: (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity launched an agent-based assistant for Android devices on Thursday as it looks to take on larger rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and incumbent assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.\n\n\"We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,\" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.\n\nOpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.\n\nTech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.\n\nLast year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the \"coming months.\"\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity, which challenges existing competitors including Apple's Siri. This development could put pressure on Apple to enhance its Siri offering further, but it also highlights the competitive landscape which Apple is part of. However, since Apple has already integrated advanced AI features into Siri and is aware of the competitive dynamics, it may not significantly impact investor sentiment negatively. Overall, the probabilities reflect a slight tendency for a stock price rise as long-term investors may view the competitive landscape as a reason for Apple to innovate rather than a risk of losing market share.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Apple already integrates ChatGPT and has Apple Intelligence in Siri, the launch of Perplexity Assistant on Android poses an indirect threat. Apple's response will be crucial. The current competitive landscape and Apple's existing strategy mitigate significant negative impact immediately, but increased competition could slightly dampen future growth prospects in AI services. Furthermore, the article mentions upcoming improvements to Amazon's Alexa which will keep the pressure on Apple to innovate and improve its offerings. The statement about Perplexity seeking permissions for iOS indicates current limitations that Apple may have chosen to enforce, suggesting a strategic stance. Taken together, the impact is slightly negative, but not significantly. Given the nature of existing integrations (Apple Intelligence, ChatGPT), and its financial size, a precipitous fall is unlikely, but modest downward pressure is possible. It would also depend on the magnitude of the initial investor reaction. This is based on a qualitative assessment, and doesn't represent definitive financial advice.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses Perplexity AI's launch of a new Android assistant, posing potential competition to Apple's Siri.  While Perplexity explicitly states its intention to eventually launch on iOS, the current news is not directly negative for Apple.  Apple is already actively developing its own AI assistant capabilities and has integrated ChatGPT. This news piece highlights a competitor's actions in the AI space but doesn't present a significant threat to Apple's overall market position or financial outlook. The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore expected to be minimal.  There's a slightly higher chance of no significant change than a positive or negative change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity, which aims to compete with Apple's Siri, among others. While this introduces competition in the AI assistant space, Apple's strong ecosystem, brand loyalty, and recent advancements with Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT integration likely mitigate any immediate negative impact. Additionally, the news does not directly indicate any operational or financial setbacks for Apple. However, increased competition could slightly pressure Apple's market position in the long term. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly negative for Apple, but not significantly impactful.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the launch of Perplexity's AI assistant on Android, which aims to compete with existing voice assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. While this development could potentially pose a threat to Apple's Siri, it's worth noting that Perplexity also expressed interest in making their assistant available on iOS pending Apple's approval. However, the news does not contain any direct negative impact on Apple's current business or stock price. Given that tech giants like Apple are continually evolving their products and services, the competitive threat from a relatively new player like Perplexity may not significantly alter Apple's market position in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining stable or rising, compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline announces the debut of Perplexity's AI assistant on Android, posing a challenge to established voice assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. However, the article also mentions Apple's efforts to develop more advanced versions of Siri and its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT. This suggests that Apple is actively working on improving its AI capabilities, which could be seen as a positive development for the company. Additionally, the fact that Perplexity's assistant is not currently available on iOS and requires Apple's permission to be made available, implies that Apple has some control over the competition in its ecosystem. Overall, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the company's ongoing efforts to enhance its AI offerings could be viewed as a competitive advantage.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

There is also discussion of Amazon's Alexa being refreshed in the near future. While Perplexity's move poses a competitive threat, Apple has been making AI innovations. It seems likely that Apple will continue building on its ecosystem, and this news of competition may further incentivize Apple to innovate therefore not having huge negative impacts on the stock price. Looking at the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models predict a slight rise due to innovation potential. Other models see risk and competition increasing. Some models even see potential negligible impacts. Given the mixed signals from previous rounds, and the fact that Apple has made efforts to adopt AI and the fact that Perplexity still needs to seek access to iOS market, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a more conservative outlook, slightly leaning towards a rise as long-term investors may view the competitive landscape as a reason for Apple to innovate, but the margin shrinking given the existence of competition.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
