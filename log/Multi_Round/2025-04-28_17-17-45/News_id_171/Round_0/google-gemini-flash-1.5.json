(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\nNews Content: (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity launched an agent-based assistant for Android devices on Thursday as it looks to take on larger rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and incumbent assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.\n\n\"We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,\" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.\n\nOpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.\n\nTech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.\n\nLast year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the \"coming months.\"\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While Perplexity explicitly states its intention to eventually launch on iOS, the current news is not directly negative for Apple.  Apple is already actively developing its own AI assistant capabilities and has integrated ChatGPT. This news piece highlights a competitor's actions in the AI space but doesn't present a significant threat to Apple's overall market position or financial outlook. The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore expected to be minimal.  There's a slightly higher chance of no significant change than a positive or negative change.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.1,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```\n"
