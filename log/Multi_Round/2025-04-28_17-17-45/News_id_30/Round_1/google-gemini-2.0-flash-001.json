(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The positive revenue forecast provided by Apple, despite mixed holiday results, has reassured investors and resulted in a significant after-hours stock price increase of over 3%. The overall revenue growth of 4% surpassed analyst expectations, and a strong performance in the services segment contributed positively. However, concerns about declining iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market could dampen investor enthusiasm, which introduces some uncertainty. Given that the forecast aligns with analyst predictions, a higher probability of stock price increase is expected, though the potential for further declines remains moderate due to ongoing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While the initial reaction was positive, with the stock climbing 3% in late trading after the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, a deeper dive reveals underlying concerns. The 4% revenue growth to $124.3 billion was helped by services revenue which beat analyst expectations. Profit also beat analyst expectations at $2.40 a share. However, there were specific weaknesses notably, the 11% drop in China revenue and the slightly below-expected iPhone sales suggests challenges in a key market and product segment. The company's attempt to catch up to its peers in AI is another potential hurdle, as well as potential new tariffs, while a new CFO may add uncertainty. On the positive side, Mac and iPad lineups performed better than expected. The forecast of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth is in line with expectations. Overall, while the immediate sentiment is positive due to the revenue forecast and some product categories exceeding expectations, the combination of China decline, AI competition, and potential tariffs suggest limited upside.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 results were mixed, with revenue beating expectations but showing weakness in China and iPhone sales falling slightly short of projections.  However, the positive reaction in after-hours trading and the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter suggest that investors are focusing on the positive aspects.  The beat on earnings per share, strong performance from services, and planned product refreshes also contribute to a positive outlook. While concerns remain about competition in China and the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence, the overall picture leans positive, particularly given the immediate market response to the forecast. The challenges in China and the AI race are long-term concerns that may not immediately impact the stock price significantly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news provided a mixed bag of results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which is in line with analyst expectations, and reported record high revenue and profit. The services division, Mac, and iPad lineups performed better than expected, contributing to the positive sentiment. Additionally, the shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, indicating investor optimism. On the negative side, there were significant declines in China sales and iPhone revenue, raising concerns about competition and market performance. However, the overall tone of the news seems to lean slightly positive, especially with the rebound in share price post-announcement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which helped boost its shares after a mixed quarterly report. Despite a decline in iPhone sales and a significant drop in revenue from China, the company's services division saw a record high. The forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth in sales aligns with analyst predictions, soothing investor concerns. The positive reaction in late trading, with shares climbing more than 3%, suggests that the market views the company's outlook as favorable. However, challenges remain, particularly in AI and competition from local brands in China. Overall, the balanced view of both positive and negative factors leads to a cautiously optimistic outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results' indicates a mixed quarterly report from Apple, with revenue growth of 4% to $124.3 billion and a record high profit of $2.40 per share. However, sales from China plunged 11%, and iPhone sales dropped less than 1%. The company's services division performed well, with a 14% growth in revenue. Considering the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, the positive performance of the services division, and the planned larger iPhone refresh, the overall sentiment seems slightly positive. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed holiday results and significant declines in China and the iPhone sales, but Apple has offered a reassuring revenue forecast with a low to mid-single digits growth rate for the current quarter. Despite challenges, the services division performed strongly, and there were positive signs for the Mac and iPad lines. Moreover, the stock price rebounded by over 3% in late trading which suggests some positive sentiment among investors. However, there are ongoing challenges with AI platforms and market competition, particularly in China.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
