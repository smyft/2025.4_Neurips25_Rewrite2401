(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, with analysts suggesting that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI investments. Dan Ives specifically highlights that Meta and other tech companies are on the verge of a significant transformation, creating a favorable outlook for Apple and other tech stocks. Given the upcoming earnings report for Apple and the overall positive tone regarding tech spending and growth prospects, it is plausible to expect that AAPL's stock price could rise. However, there is always inherent market volatility, so a significant probability of a decline also exists.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on overall Big Tech earnings expectations, with Dan Ives suggesting Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI spending, particularly by Meta. While Apple is mentioned as reporting earnings, the article does not provide specific insights or predictions related to Apple's performance or AI strategy. The positive sentiment surrounding AI investment could indirectly benefit Apple, especially if investors anticipate Apple will also showcase strong AI initiatives. However, without explicit details regarding Apple, it is difficult to ascertain a definite upward or downward pressure on the stock price. Market movements heavily rely on Apple's actual earnings report and commentary on AI adoption. Given this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the overall positive tech outlook, but cautiously, due to the lack of specific Apple discussion.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's upcoming earnings and significant AI investments, with Apple mentioned only in passing as one of the companies reporting.  Dan Ives, a prominent analyst, anticipates that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI spending. While this is positive for the overall tech sector, the news doesn't contain any specific information regarding Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and influenced more by the overall market reaction to Big Tech earnings and AI investment news than by anything specific to Apple.  A positive overall reaction to Big Tech earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price, but the lack of Apple-specific information makes a significant price movement less probable than if the news contained positive Apple-specific information.  Conversely, negative results from other Big Tech companies could negatively impact Apple, despite the generally positive outlook on AI investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments and their potential to drive growth. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple (AAPL), the overall tone suggests optimism about the tech sector, which could positively influence AAPL's stock price. Additionally, being part of the Big Tech earnings wave and the broader AI investment theme might create bullish sentiment. However, since the news does not directly address Apple's earnings or specifics about its AI strategy, the impact may be moderate. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to sector-wide optimism, but the lack of company-specific details limits the upside potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, and believes that the Street is underestimating the tech industry's potential. While the article specifically mentions Meta's AI spending and its potential impact, it also sets a positive tone for the industry as a whole, which could benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) as well. Ives' comments about the massive build-out of AI CapEx and its potential for growth could lead to increased investor confidence in tech stocks, including AAPL. However, the article does not provide specific information about AAPL's AI plans or spending, which might limit the direct positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, with a focus on Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech, particularly in regards to their investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Ives believes that Meta's announcement to spend up to $65 billion on AI capital expenditures is just the start of a massive build-out of AI CapEx. This positive outlook on Big Tech's future prospects, especially with regards to AI, is likely to have a bullish effect on the stock prices of these companies. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned and is set to report its earnings, the positive sentiment expressed by Ives could lead to an increase in Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights positive expectations for Big Tech earnings, especially around the significant investments in AI by companies like Meta. Analyst Dan Ives emphasizes the underestimation of AI spending by the Street, suggesting a bullish outlook for companies leveraging AI. While this news directly mentions Meta and other Big Tech companies, it indirectly supports Apple's potential for strong earnings if they also capitalize on AI advancements or other growth areas. The overall tone of the news is optimistic, implying a strong market performance, which typically has a positive impact on stock prices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
