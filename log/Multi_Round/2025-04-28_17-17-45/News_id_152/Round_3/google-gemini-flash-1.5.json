(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, with analysts suggesting that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI investments. Dan Ives specifically highlights that Meta and other tech companies are on the verge of a significant transformation, creating a favorable outlook for Apple and other tech stocks. Given the upcoming earnings report for Apple and the overall positive tone regarding tech spending and growth prospects, it is plausible to expect that AAPL's stock price could rise. However, there is always inherent market volatility, so a significant probability of a decline also exists.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on overall Big Tech earnings expectations, with Dan Ives suggesting Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI spending, particularly by Meta. While Apple is mentioned as reporting earnings, the article does not provide specific insights or predictions related to Apple's performance or AI strategy. The positive sentiment surrounding AI investment could indirectly benefit Apple, especially if investors anticipate Apple will also showcase strong AI initiatives. However, without explicit details regarding Apple, it is difficult to ascertain a definite upward or downward pressure on the stock price. Market movements heavily rely on Apple's actual earnings report and commentary on AI adoption. Given this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the overall positive tech outlook, but cautiously, due to the lack of specific Apple discussion.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's upcoming earnings and significant AI investments, with Apple mentioned only in passing as one of the companies reporting.  Dan Ives, a prominent analyst, anticipates that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI spending. While this is positive for the overall tech sector, the news doesn't contain any specific information regarding Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and influenced more by the overall market reaction to Big Tech earnings and AI investment news than by anything specific to Apple.  A positive overall reaction to Big Tech earnings could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price, but the lack of Apple-specific information makes a significant price movement less probable than if the news contained positive Apple-specific information.  Conversely, negative results from other Big Tech companies could negatively impact Apple, despite the generally positive outlook on AI investment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments and their potential to drive growth. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple (AAPL), the overall tone suggests optimism about the tech sector, which could positively influence AAPL's stock price. Additionally, being part of the Big Tech earnings wave and the broader AI investment theme might create bullish sentiment. However, since the news does not directly address Apple's earnings or specifics about its AI strategy, the impact may be moderate. The probability of a rise is slightly higher due to sector-wide optimism, but the lack of company-specific details limits the upside potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives is optimistic about Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, and believes that the Street is underestimating the tech industry's potential. While the article specifically mentions Meta's AI spending and its potential impact, it also sets a positive tone for the industry as a whole, which could benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) as well. Ives' comments about the massive build-out of AI CapEx and its potential for growth could lead to increased investor confidence in tech stocks, including AAPL. However, the article does not provide specific information about AAPL's AI plans or spending, which might limit the direct positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, with a focus on Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech, particularly in regards to their investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Ives believes that Meta's announcement to spend up to $65 billion on AI capital expenditures is just the start of a massive build-out of AI CapEx. This positive outlook on Big Tech's future prospects, especially with regards to AI, is likely to have a bullish effect on the stock prices of these companies. Since Apple is one of the companies mentioned and is set to report its earnings, the positive sentiment expressed by Ives could lead to an increase in Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights positive expectations for Big Tech earnings, especially around the significant investments in AI by companies like Meta. Analyst Dan Ives emphasizes the underestimation of AI spending by the Street, suggesting a bullish outlook for companies leveraging AI. While this news directly mentions Meta and other Big Tech companies, it indirectly supports Apple's potential for strong earnings if they also capitalize on AI advancements or other growth areas. The overall tone of the news is optimistic, implying a strong market performance, which typically has a positive impact on stock prices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article expresses a positive sentiment towards Big Tech earnings and highlights the significant investments in AI by companies like Meta, which may create an optimistic atmosphere for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While Apple isn't directly discussed in detail, the overall positivity surrounding AI and the potential for growth in the tech sector can lead to an increased likelihood of a rise in Apple's stock price. The previous predictions suggest a range of probabilities for Apple's stock movement, with the majority leaning towards a favorable outcome. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to rise, while acknowledging some market volatility that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on overall positive sentiment for Big Tech earnings driven by AI investments, with Dan Ives being particularly bullish and suggesting Wall Street is underestimating the potential. Apple is explicitly mentioned as reporting earnings. Previous models generally leaned towards a positive outlook, reflecting this sentiment. Several models landed in 0.55 - 0.7. The consensus appears to be bullish, although some models considered the lack of Apple-specific news a moderating factor. I will slightly increase the probability of a rise based on the historical data of prediction and the analyst overall optimistic sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the tech sector, highlighting anticipated strong earnings driven by AI investments.  However, the information is largely focused on Meta's AI spending and lacks specific details about Apple's performance or AI strategy.  While the overall positive sentiment could indirectly benefit Apple, the lack of Apple-specific news limits the certainty of a price increase.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering this ambiguity and the inherent volatility of the market, a moderate probability of a price increase is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a price decrease due to broader market factors or Apple's specific earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights a generally optimistic outlook for Big Tech earnings, with a specific focus on AI investments and their potential to drive growth. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI spending, which could benefit the entire tech sector, including Apple. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple's AI strategy, the positive sentiment around tech earnings and AI investments is likely to have a bullish effect on Apple's stock price. However, the lack of company-specific details limits the upside potential, and market volatility around earnings reports could lead to a decline. Considering the broader positive sentiment and previous predictions, the probability of a rise is higher than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses the positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments by companies like Meta. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of these investments, indicating a potential for growth in the tech sector. While the article does not provide specific information about Apple's AI strategy or earnings, the overall positive sentiment towards Big Tech could indirectly benefit Apple. Given that Apple is set to report its earnings and is a major player in the tech industry, the optimistic outlook for AI investments could lead to increased investor confidence. However, the lack of direct information about Apple's performance or AI plans means the impact on the stock price will be influenced by the broader market reaction to Big Tech earnings. Based on the positive tone and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, with analyst Dan Ives suggesting that Wall Street is underestimating the potential of tech companies, particularly in regards to their investments in artificial intelligence (AI). While the article does not provide specific information about Apple's AI plans or spending, the overall tone suggests optimism about the tech sector, which could positively influence Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for a rise. Given the positive sentiment expressed by Ives and the indirect benefits to Apple from the overall tech sector optimism, I estimate a probability of stock price rise slightly above the average of the previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly the significant investments in AI by companies like Meta. Analyst Dan Ives emphasizes the underestimation of AI spending by the Street, suggesting a bullish outlook for companies leveraging AI. While this news directly mentions Meta and other Big Tech companies, it indirectly supports Apple's potential for strong earnings if they also capitalize on AI advancements or other growth areas. The overall tone of the news is optimistic, implying a strong market performance, which typically has a positive impact on stock prices.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing significant investments in AI by companies like Meta, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. Although the article lacks specific details about Apple's performance or its AI strategy, the overall bullish sentiment in the tech sector, reinforced by analyst Dan Ives' comments about underestimating AI investments, suggests a higher probability for Apple to experience stock price appreciation. Previous predictions indicate a consensus leaning towards a rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Acknowledging the positive tone and investor optimism while considering potential market volatility, I estimate an enhanced probability of an increase in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news continues to emphasize the positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, driven by significant AI investments, particularly by Meta. Analyst Dan Ives' bullish stance, suggesting Wall Street underestimates the potential impact, reinforces this positive sentiment. While Apple is not directly mentioned in relation to AI strategy, the overall tech sector's optimism is likely to indirectly benefit AAPL. Considering the consistent leaning towards a positive outlook in previous predictions (ranging from 0.45 to 0.75 for a rise), and the reinforcement of this stance, plus increasing confidence from Model 1 and Model 2 in Round 1 predictions, I am increasing the probability of a stock price rise slightly. The market sentiment remains positive, providing a favorable environment for Apple's stock performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the tech sector, driven by analyst Dan Ives's bullish outlook on Big Tech's AI investments.  While the news focuses on Meta and doesn't offer Apple-specific details, the overall positive sentiment toward AI spending and the upcoming Big Tech earnings announcements could positively impact Apple's stock price. However, the lack of Apple-specific information introduces uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a consensus leaning toward a rise in Apple's stock price, ranging from 0.45 to 0.75 probability.  Considering the positive sector outlook and the convergence of previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledging the inherent market volatility and the absence of concrete Apple-specific news.  The slight increase in the probability of a price rise in Round 1 predictions from various models further reinforces the positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally optimistic outlook for Big Tech earnings, with a focus on AI investments and their potential to drive growth. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI spending, which could benefit the entire tech sector, including Apple. While the article does not provide specific details about Apple's AI strategy, the positive sentiment around tech earnings and AI investments is likely to have a bullish effect on Apple's stock price. Previous predictions from various models also lean towards a positive outcome, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for a rise. Given the broader positive sentiment and the indirect benefits to Apple from the overall tech sector optimism, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be slightly higher than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments by companies like Meta. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the potential impact of these investments, indicating a favorable environment for tech stocks. While Apple is not directly mentioned in terms of AI spending or strategy, the overall positive sentiment towards tech earnings and AI investments could indirectly benefit AAPL. Previous predictions range from 0.45 to 0.75 for a stock price rise, reflecting a general optimism but also some caution due to the lack of Apple-specific information. Considering the positive tone and the potential for AI-driven growth, I estimate a moderate to high probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Big Tech earnings, with analyst Dan Ives suggesting that Wall Street is underestimating the potential of tech companies, particularly in regards to their investments in artificial intelligence (AI).
