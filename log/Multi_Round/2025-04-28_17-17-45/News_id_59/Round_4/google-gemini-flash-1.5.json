      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sends 2 big signals that shatter tech investor assumptions: Snowflake CEO\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nDeepSeek has caused a permanent reset in how AI development will unfold in coming years.\n\nAt least that's the take from Snowflake (SNOW) CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose data storage company provides technology used by companies developing large language models like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n\n\"So what this [news] basically does is two things. One, it says there's still a lot of innovation left and many companies can aspire to train these models. But, two, it also raises the really interesting question of do you need to spend billions of dollars in order to train cutting-edge, world-class models? I think the jury is still out there for things like that, but it's basically upended our assumptions about where AI is going,\" Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese company that has burst onto the tech landscape seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nLast week, it surprised more than just markets after unveiling RI, its AI model that gave a ChatGPT-esque performance at an arguably cheaper price tag. RI costs a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nWatch: Why billionaire investor Ray Dalio is concerned about tech valuations\n\nFears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) chips.\n\nIn response, stocks went haywire on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s market value dropped by $588.8 billion, or 16.97%. It was the biggest ever single-day loss in a stock\u2019s market cap in absolute terms, according to Deutsche Bank data. Monday's decline for Nvidia was larger than the total market cap of Exxon or Mastercard.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia has persisted into Wednesday, with shares down 4.5%. The AI darling has seen its stock tank 11% so far this year.\n\n\"DeepSeek model suggests the cost of training GenAI models is set to decline substantially \u2026 which we see leading to faster gen-AI product innovation and availability,\" Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak said in a note.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nDeepSeek just revealed a huge risk to the stock market Billionaire Ray Dalio offers fresh tips on how to be a better investor Another bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini\n\nNowak stayed upbeat on Microsoft (MSFT) despite its investment exposure to OpenAI.\n\nInterestingly, Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on the Magnificent Seven names.\n\n\"Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers), as Apple is currently focused on smaller, function-specific, on-device LLM's, rather than large frontier models. As a result, Apple's annual capex ($9.4B in FY24) is about 1/20th the scale of the US Tier 1 hyperscalers combined, and therefore if the market hyper-focuses on capex ROI, the threshold for Apple to deliver an attractive return is far lower (i.e. less risk) than the T1 hyperscalers,\" explained Nowak.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy thinks investors need to be on high alert for more developments out of DeepSeek rivals in China.\n\n\"Even the fact that they were able to do this coming out of nowhere is a wake-up call again, that there's lots of innovation to go and many people should be trying it,\" said Ramaswamy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid. You can find more episodes on our video hub or watch on your preferred streaming service.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI technology, particularly the emergence of DeepSeek, which may lead to concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure among U.S. companies. However, analysts believe that Apple's AI strategy is less exposed to these risks, focusing on smaller, function-specific models rather than large frontier models. This positions Apple favorably, with lower capex requirements and potentially more room for returns compared to other tech giants. The overall sentiment reflects cautious optimism for Apple amidst broader market concerns, thus suggesting a higher probability of stock price stability or increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the broader implications for AI development costs have negatively impacted Nvidia and could signal a shift in investor sentiment towards companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure. However, Morgan Stanley's tech analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple's more focused and contained AI strategy, prioritizing on-device LLMs, could be advantageous in this scenario. This is because Apple's lower capex requirements make it less susceptible to concerns about ROI compared to hyperscalers. The news also contains concerns about the high valuation on technology stocks. Even though the news contains both pros and cons for Apple's valuation overall, based on the information contained in the news, the information skews toward the stock price rising in value based on current market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, whose cheaper AI model has caused a significant sell-off in US tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, due to concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure.  However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak argues that Apple (AAPL) could benefit.  Nowak highlights Apple's more contained AI ambitions, focusing on smaller, on-device models, requiring significantly less capital expenditure than larger competitors. This contrasts with the concerns raised about the massive investments of companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.  Apple's lower capex makes it less vulnerable to the market's reassessment of AI investment returns. Therefore, while the overall tech sector experiences negative pressure, Apple's different approach positions it for relative strength, suggesting a higher probability of price increase for AAPL compared to the overall negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI, particularly from DeepSeek, a Chinese company that has introduced a cost-effective AI model, challenging the high-cost models of US-based companies like OpenAI. This has caused market turbulence, especially for AI-focused stocks like Nvidia, which saw a sharp decline. However, Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as a potential winner because its AI strategy focuses on smaller, function-specific models with lower capital expenditure, making it less vulnerable to the cost pressures affecting other tech giants. Analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple's lower risk profile could attract investors amid concerns over AI development costs. Given this perspective, Apple's stock may benefit from the shifting focus towards more cost-efficient AI solutions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek and its impact on AI development costs and assumptions has led to a significant drop in Nvidia's stock price, with concerns about US companies overspending on AI infrastructure. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple's stock could be a winner due to its more contained AI ambitions and lower capital expenditure requirements compared to other major players. This perspective implies that Apple's stock might benefit from the changing landscape in AI development costs and innovation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the tech industry, particularly on companies like Nvidia and OpenAI. However, the article also mentions that Apple's AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, function-specific models, which could make it less affected by the potential decline in AI infrastructure costs. Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on other tech companies. Based on this analysis, it seems that the news is more neutral to positive for Apple, as it may benefit from the shift in the AI landscape.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the way Artificial Intelligence (AI) is perceived and developed. Specifically, the emergence of DeepSeek and its AI model suggests that advanced AI development may be less expensive than originally anticipated. Snowflake CEO's views suggest that innovation might still flourish across many companies, implying competition and increased pressure on existing leaders. However, Apple appears less impacted due to its focus on smaller, on-device LLMs, suggesting potentially lesser risks related to cost and infrastructure. Given this, while there may be short-term uncertainties impacting larger players, Apple's positioning presents a comparative advantage.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model has caused significant concerns regarding capital expenditures for U.S. tech giants, particularly impacting companies like Nvidia. However, analysts suggest that Apple is in a favorable position due to its focus on smaller, function-specific AI models, which require far lower investments. This differentiates Apple from other major players, potentially resulting in a more stable or increasing stock price amid broader market volatility. Overall, the sentiment around Apple appears to lean towards cautious optimism, particularly given its different approach to AI investment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) despite the general AI market turbulence caused by DeepSeek. The key reasoning revolves around Apple's contained AI strategy, focusing on smaller, on-device models requiring less capital expenditure. This makes Apple less vulnerable to market anxieties regarding ROI on large-scale AI investments compared to other tech giants heavily invested in frontier AI models. The news also presents an analysis of Apple vs other companies on the Magnificent Seven, such as Nvidia, which shows a relative win due to the AI strategy of Apple. Considering the overall tech landscape and Apple's strategic positioning, I believe the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than before, reflecting confidence in Apple's resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model creates uncertainty and negatively impacts companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure like Nvidia, Apple's strategy appears less vulnerable.  Apple's focus on smaller, on-device AI models, as highlighted by Morgan Stanley, means its capital expenditure and risk profile are significantly lower. This makes Apple less susceptible to the market's reassessment of AI investment returns.  The consensus among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, likely due to this perceived reduced risk. However, the overall market uncertainty stemming from the DeepSeek development introduces a degree of risk, preventing an overwhelmingly positive prediction. Considering the previous predictions and the analysis, I'm slightly more conservative than the average of the previous models, while still acknowledging the positive aspects for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, which has introduced a cost-effective AI model, challenging the high-cost models of US-based companies like OpenAI.
