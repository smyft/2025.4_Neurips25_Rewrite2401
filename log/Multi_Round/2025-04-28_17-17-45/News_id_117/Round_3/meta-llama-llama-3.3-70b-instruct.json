(AAPL)\nNews Headline: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market\nNews Content: Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off driven by concerns over AI competition, notably the emergence of DeepSeek, which has affected major players in the tech sector including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The impact on other big tech stocks suggests a bearish sentiment in the market, particularly as investors reassess growth forecasts for the leading tech companies. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' whose earnings growth expectations may now be questioned as competition in the AI domain intensifies. Given the context of market sentiment being shaken, it's reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term amid this uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to the 'Magnificent Seven' earnings growth, which has been a major driver of the bull market. The DeepSeek sell-off, driven by competition concerns in the AI space, serves as a tangible reason for investors to question future earnings. While the overall earnings outlook for the group remains positive, the risk of slowing growth and the dependence on these stocks for overall S&P 500 earnings create a vulnerability. Apple, as a member of the 'Magnificent Seven', is impacted by this sentiment. However, the article also alludes to the continued strong projected growth, with figures highlighting the Magnificent Seven earnings continuing to outperform other stocks, tempering any potential negative effect on AAPL. Given pre-market declines mentioned for the other Magnificent Seven members (5%), it's likely Apple will experience some decline, but the potential for strong earnings growth in later 2025 prevents a drastic fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on a significant sell-off in the market triggered by concerns about increased competition in the AI sector, particularly impacting Big Tech companies.  While Apple is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' the article's primary focus is on the impact of DeepSeek's AI advancements on other tech giants like Nvidia, and the potential slowdown of Big Tech's earnings growth.  Although Apple's earnings are expected to grow, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to heightened competition and concerns about slowing earnings growth will likely exert downward pressure on Apple's stock price in the short term.  The probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall because the article highlights a broader market risk that is likely to affect all 'Magnificent Seven' companies, including Apple, despite Apple's expected robust earnings growth.  However, the probability of a price fall isn't extremely high given Apple's strong fundamentals. Thus the probabilities are relatively moderate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in big tech stocks, including Apple, due to concerns about competition in the AI space sparked by DeepSeek's developments. The broader market sentiment suggests fear of a slowdown in big tech earnings growth, which has been a key driver of the bull market. Given the pre-market declines in major tech stocks (5% or more) and the general risk aversion in the sector, Apple's stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' with strong earnings expectations, the immediate market reaction to the news appears negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of the DeepSeek sell-off on the stock market, particularly on big tech companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the news specifically mentions a sell-off in stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Broadcom (AVGO), Apple's stock movement is not directly mentioned. However, given that AAPL is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and a major player in the tech industry, it could be indirectly affected. The news suggests that the market is concerned about the competition in the AI space and the sustainability of high earnings growth for big tech companies. Despite this, the 'Magnificent Seven', including AAPL, are expected to continue driving earnings growth. Given the current market sentiment and the importance of AAPL in the tech sector, there is a cautious outlook but not a clear indication of a significant stock price movement in either direction solely based on this news. Therefore, a balanced probability assessment is warranted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a sell-off in the markets due to concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, particularly for Nvidia and other big tech names. The article highlights that big tech earnings growth has been a driving force of the bull market, but a slowdown in this growth is a risk to the market. The launch of DeepSeek's AI model has sparked investor concerns, leading to a decline in stock prices of big tech companies. Given that Apple is a big tech company and a part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it is likely to be affected by the same market trends. However, the article does not specifically mention Apple, and the company's earnings growth is expected to be strong in the year ahead. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off triggered by a Chinese AI firm's development, leading to a significant downturn in major tech stocks including NVIDIA and several members of the 'Magnificent Seven.' The potential competition in AI space could impact earnings expectations for these companies. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' it faces similar risks. Although Apple has shown resilience historically, the overall bearish sentiment could affect its stock price negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about the DeepSeek sell-off creates a negative sentiment in the tech sector, particularly among the 'Magnificent Seven,' which includes Apple. Investor concerns over increased competition in the AI space are likely to affect expectations for earnings growth across the sector, including Apple's. Although Apple is expected to have solid earnings growth, the immediate market reaction to competitive threats from AI advancements signifies increased risk and potential decline in stock prices. Collectively, the previous predictions emphasize a dominant bearish outlook fueled by heightened competition and a possible slowdown in earnings growth. Therefore, a higher probability of stock price fall is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a market sell-off triggered by concerns regarding competition in the AI space, particularly with the emergence of DeepSeek. While Apple's specific performance isn't directly addressed, the general negative sentiment surrounding the 'Magnificent Seven' and their potentially slowing earnings growth is a concern. Previous predictions lean towards a negative impact, primarily due to the broad market risk. However, some analyses acknowledge Apple's inherent strength and projected growth, which prevents a drastically high probability of a stock price fall. Considering the consolidated information from the news and the previous predictions, I slightly weigh the probability towards the stock falling, but consider Apple's fundamental strength, which will likely mitigate a significant price decline. Considering predictions are getting less bearish over time, I weight upwards\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on a broad market sell-off triggered by concerns about increased AI competition, particularly impacting the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, of which Apple is a member.  While Apple's future earnings are projected to remain strong, the immediate market reaction is overwhelmingly negative, with other tech stocks experiencing significant pre-market declines of 5% or more. This negative sentiment, coupled with the overall uncertainty surrounding AI competition and its potential impact on Big Tech earnings growth, suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the short term.  The previous predictions mostly agree on this bearish outlook, although they vary slightly in their probability estimations.  Considering the severity of the sell-off in related stocks and the generally negative market sentiment, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall. However, Apple's strong projected earnings growth moderates this negative outlook, preventing an extremely pessimistic assessment. The collective estimations of various models and the overarching negative sentiment justify the probabilities provided.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a sell-off in the market driven by concerns over competition in the AI space, notably due to developments from DeepSeek. This has affected major tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven'. While Apple's earnings growth is expected to remain strong, the immediate market reaction to the news is negative, with other 'Magnificent Seven' members seeing significant pre-market declines. Given the broader bearish sentiment and the potential for slowing earnings growth in the tech sector, the probability of Apple's stock price falling in the short term is higher than it rising. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and expected earnings growth temper the downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off in the markets driven by concerns over increased competition in the AI space, sparked by DeepSeek's developments. This has impacted major tech stocks, including members of the 'Magnificent Seven'. Apple Inc. (AAPL), as part of this group, faces potential downward pressure on its stock price due to the overall negative sentiment towards big tech earnings growth. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and expected robust earnings growth temper the potential decline. Given the context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but not drastically so, due to its strong earnings expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off in the markets driven by concerns over brewing competition in the AI space, which has impacted major tech stocks. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' whose earnings growth expectations are now being questioned due to this heightened competition, there is a likelihood of downward pressure on its stock price. However, considering Apple's strong earnings growth projections and its history of resilience, the probabilities of a stock price rise and fall need to be balanced. The news primarily focuses on the impact on other tech giants and the overall market sentiment, which suggests caution but does not explicitly indicate a drastic decline for Apple. Given the range of predictions from other models, which indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the current market sentiment and competition concerns, a moderate estimation seems appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off triggered by a Chinese AI firm's development, leading to a significant downturn in major tech stocks including NVIDIA and several members of the 'Magnificent Seven.' The potential competition in AI space could impact earnings expectations for these companies. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' it faces similar risks. Although Apple has shown resilience historically, the overall bearish sentiment could affect its stock price negatively. The market is clearly reacting to potential competition and slower earnings growth forecasts, although Apple is expected to continue performing well relative to the broader market. Combining this market context with historical performance and future projections, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling, but not drastically so.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a sell-off in the tech sector, driven primarily by concerns over increased competition from the AI company DeepSeek, significantly impacting market sentiment towards major players like Apple Inc. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, face scrutiny regarding future earnings growth, which has been a crucial pillar of the ongoing bull market. While Apple's projected earnings growth remains strong, the immediate reaction in the market, demonstrated by pre-market declines in related stocks, suggests a heightened risk of downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Thus, a higher probability of falling stock prices is reasonable, considering the negative sentiment surrounding the AI competition and its implications for earnings expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a market sell-off due to concerns over AI competition, impacting the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple. Previous predictions lean bearish but acknowledge Apple's strengths. While the initial reaction is negative, Apple's robust earnings projections offer resistance. The trend in predictions shows slightly decreasing bearishness. Therefore, I'm estimating a slightly increased probability of a price rise compared to the prior rounds, although a fall is still slightly more likely due to the overall negative market sentiment and its impact on tech stocks. It seems the market overreacts initially then slightly corrects to realize the actual value.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports a market sell-off driven by concerns about increased AI competition, particularly impacting the 'Magnificent Seven', which includes Apple.  While Apple's strong earnings projections remain positive, the overall negative market sentiment and the pre-market declines of other tech giants create a significant headwind.  The consensus among previous predictions leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but  Apple's historical resilience and expected continued growth prevent an extremely pessimistic outlook. The initial strong negative reaction to the DeepSeek news outweighs Apple's individual strength in the short term, indicating a higher probability of a price drop but not a catastrophic one. The slight upward trend in the probability of price rise from Round 0 to Round 1 suggests some model mitigation for Apple\u2019s inherent strengths, but not enough to overcome the immediate negative impact of the broad market sell-off.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a significant sell-off in the tech sector, particularly affecting the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), due to concerns over competition in the AI space sparked by DeepSeek's developments. The immediate market reaction is negative, with other major tech stocks experiencing pre-market declines of 5% or more. While Apple's earnings growth is expected to remain strong, the broader bearish sentiment and potential slowdown in big tech earnings growth create downward pressure on its stock price in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and projected earnings growth temper the downside risk. Considering the collective predictions from previous rounds, which mostly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, but not drastically so due to Apple's resilience, a moderate estimation is warranted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in the tech sector driven by concerns over increased competition in the AI space, sparked by DeepSeek's developments. This has impacted major tech stocks, including members of the 'Magnificent Seven', of which Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a part. While Apple's earnings growth is expected to remain strong, the immediate market reaction to the news is negative, with other tech stocks experiencing significant pre-market declines. The overall bearish sentiment and potential for slowing earnings growth in the tech sector suggest a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and expected earnings growth temper the downside risk. Considering the range of predictions from other models and the context provided, a balanced estimation seems appropriate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about the DeepSeek sell-off creates a negative sentiment in the tech sector, particularly among the 'Magnificent Seven,' which includes Apple. Investor concerns over increased competition in the AI space are likely to affect expectations for earnings growth across the sector, including Apple's. Although Apple is expected to have solid earnings growth, the immediate market reaction to competitive threats from AI advancements signifies increased risk and potential decline in stock prices. Considering the previous predictions and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off triggered by a Chinese AI firm's development, leading to a significant downturn in major tech stocks including NVIDIA and several members of the 'Magnificent Seven.'
