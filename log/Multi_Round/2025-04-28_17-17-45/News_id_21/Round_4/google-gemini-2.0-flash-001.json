(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple lifts US stock index futures as crucial inflation test looms\nNews Content: (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock price increased by 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast and reassurance from executives about revenue growth. The positive market reaction to its earnings report suggests confidence among investors. While broader market indices are showing mixed signals, the anticipation of key inflation data has also been factored in. Overall, Apple's outlook appears optimistic, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple (AAPL). The premarket gain of 3.4% following a strong sales growth forecast, driven by anticipated recovery from iPhone sales dip and potential AI features, indicates positive investor sentiment. Deutsche Bank's reassurance from the revenue growth guidance further supports this view. While the overall market is influenced by the upcoming inflation data (PCE price index), Apple's specific positive forecast acts as a strong independent driver. Potential risks include a surprisingly high inflation print that could negatively impact the overall market and override company-specific news. However, given Apple's strong position and positive outlook, the probability of a rise is significantly higher than a fall. This positive sentiment is slightly tapered due to broader market factors like potential tariffs and broader economic uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant pre-market increase (3.4%) following the release of its earnings report, which included a forecast of strong sales growth despite recent iPhone sales dips.  Analysts viewed the guidance positively. This positive reaction suggests strong investor confidence in Apple's ability to navigate current market challenges and capitalize on AI-related opportunities.  However, the overall market context is mixed. While the broader market futures are positive, influenced by Apple's performance,  the upcoming inflation data release has the potential to impact the market negatively, thus affecting Apple's price.  The uncertainty around inflation and its effect on the Federal Reserve's policy decisions introduces risk. The news also highlights other companies with mixed performance, indicating potential volatility in the broader market, which could influence Apple's stock price. Considering the pre-market gains and positive analyst sentiment, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but the uncertainty introduced by macroeconomic factors makes a definitive prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. Analysts are reassured by the company's guidance, indicating potential recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI features. Additionally, the broader market sentiment is positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. While there is a looming inflation test that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, the immediate impact of Apple's positive earnings and guidance is likely to outweigh broader macroeconomic concerns in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news reports a strong sales growth forecast by Apple, which has led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. This positive earnings report and forecast suggest that the company is recovering from a dip in iPhone sales, driven by the rollout of AI features. Additionally, the overall market sentiment is positive, with US stock index futures rising. However, the inflation data release later in the day could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and impact the market. Considering the positive earnings report and the current market trend, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong positive outlook for Apple as its executives predicted relatively strong sales growth, driving gains in Apple and uplifting U.S. stock index futures. The market response is favorable towards Apple's projected recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI feature rollouts. However, the broader economic climate, including inflation data and geopolitical uncertainties, may introduce some volatility. Overall, Apple's outlook seems positive given the news.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news reporting a strong sales growth forecast for Apple has triggered a positive market response, as evidenced by a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. Analysts appear optimistic about Apple's potential recovery from a decline in iPhone sales, further supported by Deutsche Bank's reassuring guidance. While the broader market is facing uncertainty with an upcoming inflation report that could influence Federal Reserve policies, Apple's specific positive forecast serves as a strong independent driver for investor sentiment. Therefore, despite some macroeconomic risks, the overall outlook for Apple remains positive, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's premarket gains of 3.4% are a strong positive signal, driven by a promising sales forecast and anticipation of AI features boosting revenue. Analyst sentiment, as reflected in Deutsche Bank's note, is also reassuring. The broader market is positive, with US stock index futures up. However, the looming inflation data is a source of uncertainty. Considering past predictions, the average prediction for rise is around 0.75. Factoring in the slightly elevated risk from wider market uncertainty and recent poor AI and tech stock performance and tariffs, I will take these uncertainties into account and slightly lower the probability of a rise, while increasing the probability of a fall. In the previous round, Microsoft experienced a significant drop following a disappointing growth forecast, indicating that positive company-specific news can be overshadowed by broader market concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's strong pre-market performance (3.4% gain) following a positive earnings report and sales forecast significantly increases the likelihood of a price rise.  The forecast of low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, coupled with the anticipated success of AI features, suggests sustained investor confidence.  However, the upcoming inflation data release presents a considerable external risk.  A surprisingly high inflation number could trigger a broader market sell-off, potentially impacting Apple despite its positive news.  Considering the pre-market reaction and positive analyst sentiment, the probability of a price rise is higher, but the uncertainty introduced by macroeconomic factors necessitates a less definitive prediction than some of the previous models provided, especially given varying model opinions.  The previous round predictions showcase a general consensus of a higher likelihood of a price rise, but the range of predictions from 0.7 to 0.85 indicates uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strong sales growth forecast by Apple, leading to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. Analysts are reassured by the company's guidance, indicating a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI features. The broader market sentiment is positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. However, the upcoming inflation data release and potential macroeconomic uncertainties could introduce volatility. Given the positive earnings report and market reaction, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, though not without some risk from external factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a strong sales growth forecast driving gains in the stock price. The company's 3.4% gain in premarket trading following its earnings report suggests confidence among investors. The forecast of relatively strong sales growth and the reassurance from executives about revenue growth have contributed to the optimistic view. Additionally, the anticipation of key inflation data and its influence on the Federal Reserve's policy decisions has introduced a level of caution. However, given Apple's specific positive forecast and the current market trend, the probability of a stock price rise appears higher than a fall. The positive earnings report and guidance act as strong independent drivers for the stock's performance, outweighing the potential risks from broader economic factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. Analysts are reassured by the company's guidance, indicating potential recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI features. Additionally, the broader market sentiment is positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. While there is a looming inflation test that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, the immediate impact of Apple's positive earnings and guidance is likely to outweigh broader macroeconomic concerns in the short term. Considering the overall positive sentiment and previous predictions from other models, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's robust sales growth forecast, resulting in a significant premarket gain of 3.4%. Investors and analysts are reassured by the forecasted revenue growth, suggesting potential recovery from a dip in iPhone sales driven by AI feature rollouts. While the market is vigilant about upcoming inflation data, Apple's strong performance and positive outlook overshadow broader market uncertainties. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a stronger inclination towards a stock price rise. The overall market futures, particularly for Nasdaq, are also rising, further supporting a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's strong sales growth forecast and a 3.4% gain in premarket trading indicates positive investor sentiment. Analysts are reassured by the company's guidance, indicating a potential recovery in iPhone sales supported by upcoming AI features. While there is macroeconomic uncertainty regarding upcoming inflation data, which could have an impact on the broader market, Apple's specific positive outlook provides a strong independent driver for its stock price. Based on the overall positive sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of an increase in stock price compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's strong pre-market performance, driven by promising sales forecasts and the anticipation of AI features, is a significant positive indicator. Analyst sentiment, as reflected in Deutsche Bank's note, reinforces this optimism. The broader market also shows positive movement, with US stock index futures on the rise. However, the upcoming inflation data presents a considerable risk that cannot be ignored. Taking into account previous predictions and factoring in broader market uncertainties such as potential tariffs and the performance of other AI and tech stocks, there's a strong case to slightly lower the probability of a rise to remain conservative. The fact that key competitors like Microsoft have experienced drops following disappointing forecasts also necessitates a more tempered outlook despite Apple's current momentum. The overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple seems to have waned a bit, so a conservative approach would be prudent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: Apple's strong pre-market performance (3.4% gain) following a positive earnings report and sales growth forecast is the dominant factor.  The forecast of low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, coupled with anticipated AI feature success, suggests sustained investor confidence.  This positive sentiment is supported by Deutsche Bank's analyst note. However, the upcoming inflation data release and broader market uncertainty (tariffs, AI stock rout) introduce significant external risks. A surprisingly high inflation number could trigger a broader market sell-off, potentially negatively impacting Apple despite its positive news.  The previous predictions from various models show a general consensus of a higher likelihood of a price rise, with most clustering around 0.7-0.8 probability.  While the overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, the macroeconomic risks warrant a slightly lower probability of a rise compared to the most optimistic predictions, and a slightly higher probability of a fall than the most pessimistic. I've considered the collective reasoning and predictions across multiple rounds, incorporating the impact of broader market factors and recent volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a 3.4% gain in premarket trading following a robust sales growth forecast. Analysts, including those from Deutsche Bank, are reassured by the company's guidance, which suggests a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI features. The broader market sentiment is also positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. While there is some uncertainty due to the upcoming inflation data release, which could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, Apple's specific positive forecast and market reaction are likely to outweigh broader macroeconomic concerns in the short term. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a higher probability of a stock price rise, with an average probability around 0.75 for a rise and 0.25 for a fall. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a strong sales growth forecast driving gains in the stock price. The company's 3.4% gain in premarket trading following its earnings report suggests confidence among investors. Analysts appear reassured by Apple's guidance, indicating potential recovery from iPhone sales dip due to upcoming AI features. While broader market indices are showing mixed signals, the anticipation of key inflation data has also been factored in. Considering the positive earnings report, guidance, and analyst sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall. However, external factors such as macroeconomic uncertainties and potential tariffs introduce some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a strong sales growth forecast driving gains in the stock price. The company's 3.4% gain in premarket trading following its earnings report suggests confidence among investors. The forecast of relatively strong sales growth and the reassurance from executives about revenue growth have contributed to the optimistic view. Additionally, the anticipation of key inflation data and its influence on the Federal Reserve's policy decisions has introduced a level of caution. However, given Apple's specific positive forecast and the current market trend, the probability of a stock price rise appears higher than a fall. The positive earnings report and guidance act as strong independent drivers for the stock's performance, outweighing the potential risks from broader economic factors. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a stronger inclination towards a stock price rise, with an average prediction of around 0.75-0.8 for a rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's robust sales growth forecast, resulting in a significant premarket gain of 3.4%. Investors and analysts are reassured by the forecasted revenue growth, suggesting potential recovery from a dip in iPhone sales driven by AI feature rollouts. While the market is vigilant about upcoming inflation data, Apple's strong performance and positive outlook overshadow broader market uncertainties. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a stronger inclination towards a stock price rise. The overall market futures, particularly for Nasdaq, are also rising, further supporting a positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: Apple's stock has seen a positive response, with a notable 3.4% gain in premarket trading, signaling investor confidence following a strong sales growth forecast. Analysts are optimistic about Apple's recovery from a dip in iPhone sales, bolstered by the rollout of AI features. While the broader market faces uncertainty with upcoming inflation data, the specific positive outlook for Apple appears to outweigh these macroeconomic concerns. Historically, similar news trends have resulted in upward movements for Apple, further supporting the prediction of a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's strong pre-market gain of 3.4% and positive sales growth forecast indicate strong investor confidence. Analysts are also optimistic due to potential recovery in iPhone sales from new AI features. However, the upcoming inflation data poses a significant risk as it could influence the Federal Reserve's policies and trigger a broader market sell-off. Considering previous rounds' predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of a price rise, but factoring in the uncertainties of inflation and the potential for broader market volatility, I am slightly reducing the probability of a rise compared to the earlier rounds, acknowledging the external economic risks. The AI narrative is also taking some hits as can be seen from other AI related stock's reaction, therefore, I slightly consider this negative correlation with Apple's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: Apple's strong pre-market performance (3.4% gain) following a positive earnings report and sales forecast is the primary driver for a positive outlook.  The projected low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, coupled with the anticipated success of AI features, suggests sustained investor confidence, supported by Deutsche Bank's positive analysis.  However, significant countervailing factors exist. The upcoming inflation data release poses a considerable risk. A surprisingly high inflation number could trigger a broader market sell-off, potentially negatively impacting Apple.  Furthermore, broader market uncertainties, including the recent AI stock rout, tariffs, and the mixed performance of other tech companies (e.g., Microsoft's drop), introduce significant volatility.  Considering the collective reasoning and predictions across multiple rounds, and weighing the strong company-specific positive news against the considerable macroeconomic risks, a conservative probability is assigned. The consistent trend across previous predictions also informs this estimate, indicating a general consensus leaning towards a price rise, but with a recognition of the inherent uncertainty involved.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a 3.4% gain in premarket trading following a robust sales growth forecast. Analysts, including those from Deutsche Bank, are reassured by the company's guidance, which suggests a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI features.
