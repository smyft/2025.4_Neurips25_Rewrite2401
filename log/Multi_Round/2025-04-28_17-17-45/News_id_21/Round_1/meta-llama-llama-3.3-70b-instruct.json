(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple lifts US stock index futures as crucial inflation test looms\nNews Content: (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock price increased by 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast and reassurance from executives about revenue growth. The positive market reaction to its earnings report suggests confidence among investors. While broader market indices are showing mixed signals, the anticipation of key inflation data has also been factored in. Overall, Apple's outlook appears optimistic, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple (AAPL). The premarket gain of 3.4% following a strong sales growth forecast, driven by anticipated recovery from iPhone sales dip and potential AI features, indicates positive investor sentiment. Deutsche Bank's reassurance from the revenue growth guidance further supports this view. While the overall market is influenced by the upcoming inflation data (PCE price index), Apple's specific positive forecast acts as a strong independent driver. Potential risks include a surprisingly high inflation print that could negatively impact the overall market and override company-specific news. However, given Apple's strong position and positive outlook, the probability of a rise is significantly higher than a fall. This positive sentiment is slightly tapered due to broader market factors like potential tariffs and broader economic uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant pre-market increase (3.4%) following the release of its earnings report, which included a forecast of strong sales growth despite recent iPhone sales dips.  Analysts viewed the guidance positively. This positive reaction suggests strong investor confidence in Apple's ability to navigate current market challenges and capitalize on AI-related opportunities.  However, the overall market context is mixed. While the broader market futures are positive, influenced by Apple's performance,  the upcoming inflation data release has the potential to impact the market negatively, thus affecting Apple's price.  The uncertainty around inflation and its effect on the Federal Reserve's policy decisions introduces risk. The news also highlights other companies with mixed performance, indicating potential volatility in the broader market, which could influence Apple's stock price. Considering the pre-market gains and positive analyst sentiment, the probability of a rise is higher than a fall, but the uncertainty introduced by macroeconomic factors makes a definitive prediction difficult.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast, which has led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. Analysts are reassured by the company's guidance, indicating potential recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI features. Additionally, the broader market sentiment is positive, with U.S. stock index futures rising. While there is a looming inflation test that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, the immediate impact of Apple's positive earnings and guidance is likely to outweigh broader macroeconomic concerns in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news reports a strong sales growth forecast by Apple, which has led to a 3.4% gain in premarket trading. This positive earnings report and forecast suggest that the company is recovering from a dip in iPhone sales, driven by the rollout of AI features. Additionally, the overall market sentiment is positive, with US stock index futures rising. However, the inflation data release later in the day could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and impact the market. Considering the positive earnings report and the current market trend, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong positive outlook for Apple as its executives predicted relatively strong sales growth, driving gains in Apple and uplifting U.S. stock index futures. The market response is favorable towards Apple's projected recovery from a dip in iPhone sales due to upcoming AI feature rollouts. However, the broader economic climate, including inflation data and geopolitical uncertainties, may introduce some volatility. Overall, Apple's outlook seems positive given the news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
