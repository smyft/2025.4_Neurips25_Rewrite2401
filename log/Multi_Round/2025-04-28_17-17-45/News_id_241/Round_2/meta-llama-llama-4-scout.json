Here's the Best of the Bunch for Income Investors to Buy Right Now.\nNews Content: Warren Buffett primarily buys large-cap stocks for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. That makes sense because Berkshire has so much money to deploy that smaller companies simply don't move the needle enough for the giant conglomerate.\n\nBecause of this focus on large-cap stocks, you probably won't be surprised that Buffett owns six stocks that are members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI). Which is the best pick of the bunch for income investors right now?\n\nBuffett's Dow six-pack\n\nThe two stocks Buffett has owned the longest are both members of the Dow. Buffett initiated a position for Berkshire in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) in 1988. He bought shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) in 1991. Both Coke and AmEx are \"forever stocks\" for Buffett. In his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, he wrote that the two stocks were among a select group he planned to \"maintain indefinitely.\"\n\nHowever, Buffett thinks another Dow stock is \"an even better business\" than Coca-Cola and American Express. He didn't list Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in the latest shareholder letter as one of the stocks he would own indefinitely. But when asked about the omission by CNBC's Becky Quick at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2024, Buffett sang Apple's praises.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Apple ranks as Berkshire's largest holding, while AmEx is No. 2 and Coke is No. 4. A Dow stock also holds the No. 5 spot -- Chevron(NYSE: CVX). Buffett began aggressively buying the oil stock in the fourth quarter of 2020 after its steep plunge during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBerkshire doesn't have such large stakes in the other two Dow stocks it owns. Both Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa(NYSE: V) make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nHow these Dow stocks compare\n\nAmerican Express has been the biggest winner by far over the last 12 months among Buffett's six Dow stocks, with its shares skyrocketing over 70%. Amazon stock has also soared more than 45%. All the others except Coca-Cola have delivered double-digit percentage gains.\n\nDespite its strong performance, American Express' valuation remains more reasonable than most of the others. The financial services giant's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 20.5, lower than Coke's forward P/E of 21.1 and well below the forward earnings multiples of Visa, Apple, and Amazon. Only Chevron has a lower valuation, with its shares trading at 12.6 times forward earnings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat about earnings growth? Amazon is the clear leader. The e-commerce and cloud services leader reported earnings of $15.3 billion in its latest quarterly update, a year-over-year increase of 55%. None of Buffett's other Dow stocks came close to that level of earnings growth in their most recent quarters.\n\nBuffett probably doesn't care what Wall Street thinks about these stocks. In case you were wondering, though, Coca-Cola appears to be analysts' favorite right now. The consensus 12-month price target for Coke reflects an upside potential of 15%. Wall Street is also relatively bullish about Amazon, Apple, and Chevron.\n\nBest of the bunch for income investors\n\nNow, to answer our initial question: Which of Buffett's Dow stocks is the best pick for income investors? There are two main contenders -- Chevron and Coca-Cola.\n\nWe can scratch Amazon off the list, since it doesn't offer a dividend. Apple, American Express, and Visa probably won't appeal to income investors much either with their paltry forward dividend yields of under 1%.\n\nChevron, though, pays a forward dividend yield of 4.05%. The company has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Coca-Cola's yield of 3.1% is lower. However, its track record is even more impressive. The food and beverage maker is a Dividend King, with 62 consecutive dividend increases and counting.\n\nI don't think income investors can go wrong with either Chevron or Coke. However, I think Chevron's higher yield makes it the best of the bunch.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Although it was not designated a 'forever stock', Buffett's endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for Apple shares. Additionally, Apple's strong foothold in the market as a large-cap stock positions it well against potential declines. However, its lower dividend yield, compared to dividend-focused stocks like Chevron, may temper some investor enthusiasm. Overall, the positive sentiment from Buffett's comments is likely to outweigh any negative factors, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's holdings in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, highlighting Apple as one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. While the article mentions Buffett's praise for Apple, it doesn't provide any new information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The main focus is on income-generating stocks and the article suggests that Chevron and Coca-Cola are better choices for income investors.  The article also mentions that Apple's dividend yield is under 1%, which may not attract income investors, potentially slightly reducing demand.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause significant upward or downward pressure on Apple's stock price.  The probabilities reflect a relatively neutral market response to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's positive view on Apple (AAPL), despite not listing it among 'forever stocks' in the latest shareholder letter. Buffett praised Apple during the 2024 Berkshire annual meeting, and Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding. The article also notes that Apple's valuation is higher than some of Buffett's other Dow holdings, but its earnings growth and Wall Street's bullish outlook (with a consensus 12-month price target reflecting upside potential) are positives. However, the article primarily focuses on income investors, where Apple's low dividend yield makes it less attractive compared to Chevron or Coca-Cola. The mention of Apple as a strong business and its position as Berkshire's top holding suggests investor confidence, which could support a stock price rise. However, the lack of immediate income appeal might limit the impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investments in six Dow Jones stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article does not provide specific news about Apple's future performance, it does mention that Buffett has a significant stake in the company, which is his largest holding. The article highlights Chevron (CVX) as a favorable pick for income investors due to its higher dividend yield and long track record of dividend increases. However, the article does not provide negative information about Apple. Given that Buffett's investment in Apple is viewed positively by the market and there is no negative news about the company, it is likely that the stock price will rise. However, the lack of specific positive news about Apple's future prospects and the overall market conditions may temper the stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Although Apple is mentioned as a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, the article concludes that Chevron and Coca-Cola are the top contenders for income investors due to their dividend yields. Since the article does not provide any negative news about Apple and instead presents a positive view of Warren Buffett's opinion on the company, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's views on various Dow Jones stocks, including Apple. Although Buffett has a large stake in Apple and praised the stock, his comments did not specifically mention owning it indefinitely. However, given the overall positive context regarding Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and the focus on income-generating stocks like Chevron and Coca-Cola, which received high recommendations, it suggests a generally positive sentiment towards large-cap stocks. Apple's strong earnings growth and its position as Berkshire's largest holding could further support the stock. However, the emphasis on dividend-yielding stocks like Chevron may slightly shift investor focus towards them.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Warren Buffett's favorable view of Apple Inc., highlighting it as a significant large-cap holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Although Buffett did not categorize Apple as a 'forever stock,' his praise indicates strong long-term confidence in the company. While the article emphasizes alternatives for income-focused investors, particularly Chevron and Coca-Cola due to their higher dividend yields, it does not present any negative information about Apple. The lack of immediate catalysts for a substantial stock price rise may moderate expectations, but overall sentiment towards Apple remains positive based on Buffett's involvement and market positioning. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of an increase in stock price, reflecting the overall bullish sentiment rather than the lack of dividend appeal compared to other stocks mentioned.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's Dow holdings, noting Apple as Berkshire Hathaway's largest position and highlighting Buffett's positive sentiment towards the company, even if it's not designated as a 'forever stock'. While the article primarily focuses on income stocks like Chevron and Coca-Cola (where Apple's lower dividend yield is a negative), the reaffirmation of Buffett's faith, Apple's strong financials mentioned, plus previous round predictions leaning bullish, suggest a likely, though potentially tempered, rise in stock price. I will adjust the probability considering the other models' and human's prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article is largely positive towards Apple, highlighting Warren Buffett's significant investment and praise.  However, the article's primary focus is on income-generating stocks, and Apple's low dividend yield is explicitly mentioned as a drawback for income investors.  This creates a nuanced picture:  Buffett's continued large holding and positive comments suggest continued confidence, supporting a price rise.  However, the article's focus elsewhere might dilute the positive impact. Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.45 to 0.7 probability of a rise, and the overall lack of significantly negative news, a moderate probability of a price rise seems appropriate, slightly higher given the weighting towards Buffett's continued holding.  The probability of a fall is correspondingly lower.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's holdings in six Dow Jones stocks, including Apple Inc.
