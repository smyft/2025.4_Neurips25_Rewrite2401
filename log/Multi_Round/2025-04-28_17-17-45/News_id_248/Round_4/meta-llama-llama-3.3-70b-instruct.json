(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023.

(NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Cliff Asness, a prominent billionaire investor, holds a significant stake in Apple (AAPL) through his firm AQR Capital Management.  While Asness's overall outlook on the broader market is somewhat cautious, his position in AAPL suggests a degree of optimism regarding the company's prospects.  The inclusion of AAPL as the second-largest holding in AQR's portfolio is a positive indicator, suggesting confidence in Apple's future performance.  Furthermore, the article mentions strong Q4 2024 results for Apple, including revenue growth and substantial shareholder returns.  However, the article also notes that some analysts consider other AI stocks as potentially more promising investments with faster returns.  This presents a counterpoint that mitigates the bullish sentiment to some extent.  Considering the mixed signals and generally positive overall performance data for AAPL, a neutral-to-slightly positive outlook seems more appropriate than a strongly bullish or bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc.

Apple's strong fundamentals, including revenue growth, robust cash flow, and a diversified product ecosystem, are underscored. Positive analyst ratings and performance metrics, such as App Store revenue growth, further support a potential stock price rise. While there are concerns about broader market conditions and high CAPE ratios, the specific bullish sentiment and strong financials outweigh these negatives for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management, led by Asness, holds a significant stake in Apple worth $1.87 billion as of Q3 2024. Additionally, Evercore ISI recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue showed a 6% increase year-over-year, with product revenue up and operating cash flow of $27 billion. Despite some volatility, the overall sentiment around Apple appears positive due to its strong financials and potential in AI services. However, Cliff Asness' general concerns about the U.S. stock market and high CAPE ratios might temper enthusiasm. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher due to the positive outlook from Asness and Evercore ISI, but tempered by Asness' broader market concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting the company's strong financial performance, including a 6% revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a 15% growth rate in App Store revenue. Additionally, the article mentions Evercore ISI's reaffirmed Outperform rating and $250 price target for Apple. However, it also notes that Asness' comments on the broader U.S. stock market, including his prediction of mediocre returns over the next ten years, may have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is slightly positive, but the market's reaction to Asness' comments on the broader market may limit the stock's potential upside.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Cliff Asness, a well-known and successful investor, holds Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of his top stock recommendations. Asness' involvement often brings attention and confidence to the stock, potentially driving up demand. Additionally, recent financial performance indicators show a consistent revenue growth and strong cash flows, supporting the stock's stability and attractiveness. However, concerns about high CAPE ratios and potential volatility due to AI technology introductions could introduce uncertainty. Despite these factors, the strong backing from a respected investor combined with historical positive performance suggests a high likelihood of continued interest.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness' bullish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is generally a strong signal that could influence investor sentiment positively. AQR Capital Management's substantial stake in Apple, along with reaffirmed positive ratings and strong recent financial performances, such as revenue growth, reinforce a favorable outlook for the stock. While there are mentions of broader market concerns, particularly regarding high CAPE ratios, these do not seem to overshadow the positive indicators surrounding Apple's fundamentals. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher considering the overall positive sentiment and performance metrics presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news focuses on Cliff Asness being bullish on Apple and holding a significant stake. This carries weight due to his reputation and track record. Positive Q4 2024 financial results and an 'Outperform' rating from analysts further bolster confidence. However, Asness' broader concerns about market valuations and competition in the AI space present headwinds. Others in previous rounds generally leaned positive, giving rise probabilities above 0.5, influenced by Asness' position and Apple's financials. Considering this and the minimal impact on those predictions, a positive prediction is still supported in this round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news piece centers on Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple, a prominent investor whose positive sentiment carries significant weight.  His firm's substantial holding in AAPL reinforces this. Apple's recent financial results, including revenue growth and strong cash flow, further support a positive outlook.  However, counterbalancing factors exist. Asness expresses concerns about broader market conditions and high CAPE ratios, suggesting a more cautious outlook on the overall market.  Furthermore, the article mentions that some believe other AI stocks offer potentially greater returns in the shorter term, slightly diminishing the focus on Apple's AI potential. Considering the positive endorsement from a respected investor, Apple's solid financials, and the tempered market outlook, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than that of a price fall. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price rise, albeit with some variance in the exact probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc.

Apple's recent financial results, including revenue growth, positive analyst ratings, and robust cash flows, further bolster confidence in the stock. While there are broader market concerns from Asness regarding high CAPE ratios, the specific positive sentiment and strong fundamentals for AAPL suggest a higher likelihood of price appreciation. Previous predictions also lean towards a positive outlook, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price rising. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is assessed to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc.

The article also notes positive financial performance indicators, including recent revenue growth, strong cash flows, and a reaffirmed Outperform rating by Evercore ISI with a price target of $250. However, there are mixed sentiments, as Asness himself expresses concerns about the broader U.S. stock market and high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios. These concerns could temper optimism, yet the overall positive financial performance and the confidence of a respected investor outweigh these negatives.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights that Cliff Asness, a respected hedge fund manager, is bullish on Apple Inc.

AQR Capital Management's significant stake and a positive reaffirmation from analysts, along with robust recent financial performance (notably a revenue increase and strong cash flow), suggest a favorable outlook for the stock. While there are broader market concerns mentioned by Asness regarding high CAPE ratios that could temper enthusiasm, the specific positive sentiment surrounding Apple's fundamentals outweighs these negatives. Considering the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a positive outlook, a higher probability of the stock price rising seems justified.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news focuses on Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple, which is a significant positive indicator given his reputation. Apple's strong financial performance, including revenue growth and analyst ratings (Evercore ISI's Outperform rating), further supports this view. However, Asness also expresses general concerns about the U.S. stock market's high valuation (CAPE ratios), which tempers the bullish sentiment. Considering this mixed outlook, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall. The previous rounds consensus showed the models believed the price was more likely to rise as well, though there was a slight decrease in the probability of the price rising, as well as some differences among models.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple.  Cliff Asness, a highly respected value and momentum investor, is bullish on AAPL and his firm holds a substantial stake. This endorsement carries significant weight and is likely to influence other investors positively.  Apple's recent financial results also show positive growth in revenue and App Store performance.  Evercore ISI's Outperform rating and price target further reinforce the positive sentiment.  However, counterbalancing factors exist. Asness expresses broader concerns about the US stock market and high CAPE ratios, suggesting potential headwinds for the overall market, which could indirectly impact Apple's stock price.  The consensus among previous prediction models also leans towards a rise, though the probability estimates vary. Considering the strong positive signals from Asness's endorsement and Apple's financials, coupled with the general market uncertainty and the moderately varying previous predictions, a probability slightly higher than 0.6 for a price rise seems reasonable. The probabilities are adjusted to ensure they add up to 1.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc.

(AAPL), which typically boosts investor confidence. AQR Capital Management's substantial stake in AAPL and recent positive financial performance highlight strong fundamentals for the company. Despite Asness expressing concerns about the overall U.S. stock market and high CAPE ratios, these factors seem less impactful compared to the positive sentiment surrounding Apple's revenue growth and positive analyst ratings. Previous predictions generally lean towards a price increase, reinforcing a higher probability of stock price appreciation, while acknowledging potential broader market risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The prevalent sentiment from the news and prior predictions leans towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). The primary driver is Cliff Asness' bullish stance and his firm's significant stake. Apple's solid financial performance, including revenue growth and a reiterated Outperform rating from Evercore ISI, reinforces investor confidence. However, Asness' general concerns regarding broader market valuations (CAPE ratios) introduce a degree of caution. Notably, preceding rounds uniformly predicted a higher likelihood of a stock price increase. Consistent with the ongoing trend and with slight weighting to the fact that Apple is a mature dividend stock, I foresee a continued positive trajectory. Because of the maturity of AAPL, I will temper the likelihood to be lower towards price appreciation than the last round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.64, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.36, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple.  Cliff Asness, a highly respected investor, is bullish on AAPL, and his firm holds a substantial stake. This endorsement is significant and likely to influence other investors. Apple's strong Q4 2024 financials, including revenue growth and App Store performance, further support this view.  Evercore ISI's Outperform rating adds to the positive sentiment. However, Asness's broader concerns about the US stock market and high CAPE ratios introduce some uncertainty.  Previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price rise, though the exact probabilities vary.  Considering the strong positive signals from Asness and Apple's fundamentals alongside market uncertainty, a probability slightly above 0.6 for a price rise is reasonable. The probabilities are adjusted to ensure they sum to 1.  The slight decrease in predicted probability of a price increase across multiple prediction rounds suggests a growing awareness of the countervailing market concerns, although the overall sentiment remains positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc.
