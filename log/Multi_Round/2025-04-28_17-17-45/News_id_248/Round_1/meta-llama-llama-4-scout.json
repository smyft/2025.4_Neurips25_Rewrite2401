(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness.
