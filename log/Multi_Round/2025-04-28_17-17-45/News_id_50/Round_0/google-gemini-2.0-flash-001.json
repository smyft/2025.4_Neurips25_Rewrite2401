While this doesn't directly concern chips used in Apple's latest products, it signals a potential slowdown in the broader electronics market which could negatively affect demand for Apple's products as well as raising concern regarding supply chain resilience. Apple is a relatively stable stock with diversified income and significant cash amount, therefore, negative movements in stock price are likely to be smaller. Considering relative weakness, I assess the likelihood of a price decrease, versus a price increase. \",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
