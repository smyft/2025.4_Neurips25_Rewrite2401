While STMicroelectronics supplies Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small.  Apple is a large and diversified company, and the impact of weaker demand for a specific type of chip from one supplier is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's overall performance. The news is more relevant to STMicroelectronics' stock price than Apple's. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in Apple's stock due to this news alone is low.  A slight negative impact is possible due to the overall negative sentiment around the semiconductor industry, but it's unlikely to be substantial.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```\n"
