Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\nNews Content: Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nApple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion. \r\n\r\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base has been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL\u2019s Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo\u2019s growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies\u2019 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple\u2019s market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.5%.\n\nApple Stock\u2019s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 27.54X.\n\nPrice/Earnings (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul. \r\n\r\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple, emphasizing concerns over iPhone sales which are expected to decline due to strong competition in China and delays in product launches. However, the Services segment is expected to show strong growth, potentially offsetting some of the weaknesses in hardware sales. The market also views Apple as overvalued at present, which could discourage buying. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of a price decline as the concerns appear to outweigh the positives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report revenue and EPS growth, driven by Services and Mac sales, there are concerns about declining iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence. Zacks Consensus Estimate suggest a conservative growth outlook, however, the undervaluation and China head winds, coupled with the 'Sell' rating from Zacks contributes a higher likelihood of price decrease after earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS increase and steady Services growth are positive, concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, a delayed Apple Intelligence launch, and a high valuation (Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)) outweigh the positives.  The projected slight decline in iPhone sales is significant given its contribution to overall revenue and indicates a potential near-term headwind. The fact that AAPL shares have underperformed the sector also suggests negative investor sentiment. While the AI push is a long-term positive, its impact on the Q1 results is uncertain and doesn't counter the immediate negative factors. The Zacks Rank of Sell further strengthens the bearish sentiment. Considering all factors a slightly higher probability of a price fall is predicted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. On the positive side, the company has a consistent track record of beating EPS estimates, with a 5.05% average surprise in the trailing four quarters. The Services segment is expected to show steady growth (13.2% YoY), and the Mac segment is projected to see a significant increase in sales (17.3% YoY). Additionally, Apple's focus on AI with Apple Intelligence could improve its competitive position in the long term. However, there are significant headwinds, including expected declines in iPhone sales (0.7% YoY) due to competition in China and a delay in Apple Intelligence rollout. The stock is also considered overvalued with a forward P/E of 28.97X, higher than the sector average, and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Given these factors, the market may react negatively to the earnings report, especially if iPhone sales disappoint or guidance is weaker than expected.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its Q1 earnings on January 30. The company's revenue is expected to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is $124.04 billion, indicating a 3.73% growth. However, iPhone sales are likely to decline by 0.7% year-over-year. The Services segment is expected to grow 13.2% year-over-year. Apple's valuation is considered stretched with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X. The stock has underperformed the sector, returning 16.2% compared to 27.5% for the sector. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems moderate due to the expected growth in Services and steady Mac sales, but concerns about iPhone sales and valuation might limit the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings. While the company's Services segment is expected to grow steadily, iPhone sales are likely to decline due to competition in China. The delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence and reported bugs are also concerns. Additionally, Apple's valuation is considered stretched, with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio higher than the sector average. However, the company's AI push and expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ are potential positives. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report and provides details on expected revenue and earnings. The earnings expectations for both revenue and earnings remain largely positive but stable. However, concerns are raised regarding iPhone sales potential decline, delays in AI launch, and near-term impacts from China. Despite these concerns, the Services segment growth remains strong, but Apple's high P/E ratio and underperformance compared to the sector could be a deterrent.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While revenues and earnings are expected to grow, primarily driven by the Services and Mac segments, concerns about declining iPhone sales due to strong competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence diminish the overall positive sentiment. The company also carries a 'Sell' rating from Zacks, indicating negative investor sentiment. Given the high forward P/E ratio and underperformance relative to the sector, which suggests that the stock is overvalued, the risk of a price decline appears higher than the potential for a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of a price decrease, primarily due to concerns over declining iPhone sales in China, a delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence, and an already-stretched valuation. The positive aspects, such as Services growth and increasing Mac sales, are not considered strong enough to outweigh these negatives. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also reinforces the bearish sentiment. While others' predictions have generally stayed within a range(0.35-0.55), Considering the consistent concerns and factoring in the others round predictions of high probablity of failing I will weight my prediction slightly more towards price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Services segment is expected to perform strongly, and Mac sales are projected to rise, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed Apple Intelligence launch are significant concerns.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the high P/E ratio further suggest an overvalued stock. While Apple's AI push is a long-term positive, its near-term impact is uncertain.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight bias towards a price decline. Considering the potential for disappointment regarding iPhone sales, the high valuation, and the negative Zacks rating, the probability of a price fall is judged slightly higher than the probability of a price rise. The consistent EPS beats historically are positive, but not enough to overcome the current headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. On the positive side, the company has a strong track record of beating EPS estimates, with an average surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Services segment is expected to grow by 13.2% year-over-year, and the Mac segment shows promising growth with a 17.3% year-over-year increase in shipments. The company's AI push, particularly with Apple Intelligence, could enhance its competitive position in the long term. However, significant concerns include expected declines in iPhone sales (0.7% year-over-year) due to competition in China, delays in the Apple Intelligence rollout, and a stretched valuation with a forward P/E of 28.97X, higher than the sector average. Additionally, Apple's stock has underperformed the sector, and it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Given these factors, the market may react negatively to the earnings report, especially if iPhone sales disappoint or guidance is weaker than expected. Considering the balance of positives and negatives, the probability of a price decline is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the Services segment is expected to show steady growth (13.2% YoY), iPhone sales are likely to decline due to competition in China.

Considering the previous predictions, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, the trend of others' beliefs suggests that the market is cautious about Apple's performance. The majority of previous models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65. Given the mixed signals and the market's cautious sentiment, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the Services segment is expected to show strong growth (13.2% YoY), and Mac segment is expected to increase by 17.3% YoY. Additionally, the company has a strong track record of beating EPS estimates. However, concerns remain regarding the potential decline in iPhone sales (0.7% YoY), delays in the launch of Apple Intelligence, and reported bugs which could weigh on near-term performance. Furthermore, Apple is viewed as overvalued with a forward P/E of 28.97X, higher than the sector average, and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), adding pressure to the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
