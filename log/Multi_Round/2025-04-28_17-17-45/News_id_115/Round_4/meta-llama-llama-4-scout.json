(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's upcoming earnings report shows expected growth in earnings and revenues, but there has been a downward revision in EPS estimates. This could lead to mixed investor sentiment. Additionally, Apple's recent performance, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggests caution. The estimated growth in key metrics reflects overall growth potential, but the revisions and recent price decrease may make investors skeptical. Thus, there is a higher probability of price decline given the recent trend and analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  Firstly, the consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, indicating weakening analyst confidence.  Secondly, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating strongly suggests underperformance.  Thirdly, the projected iPhone revenue shows a slight year-over-year decline (-0.7%), a crucial metric given the iPhone's significance to Apple's overall revenue. While some segments show growth (Services, Mac, Wearables, iPad, some geographic regions), the negative revision of EPS and the overall negative market sentiment (AAPL's -12.8% return vs S&P 500's +1.1% over the past month) outweigh the positive indicators. The overall picture is one of cautious optimism at best, given the significant negative market sentiment and downward EPS revision.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the provided financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) reveals mixed signals. On the positive side, the company is expected to show year-over-year growth in earnings per share (+8.3%) and overall revenue (+3.7%), with notable increases in segments like Services (+13.2%), Mac (+7%), and Wearables, Home and Accessories (+5%). However, there are concerns, including a downward revision of the EPS estimate by 1.1% over the past 30 days, a slight decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), and negative growth in some geographic regions like Rest of Asia Pacific (-2.5%) and Japan (-0.8%). Additionally, the stock has underperformed recently with a -12.8% return over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%, and it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near term. Given these factors, the market reaction is likely to be cautious, balancing the positive earnings growth against the negative revisions and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's Q1 performance. The company is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, an increase of 8.3% year-over-year, and revenues of $124.04 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. However, the consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, which could indicate potential negative sentiment. Specific segments like 'Net Sales- Products' are expected to grow slightly by 1.2%, while 'Net Sales- Services' are expected to grow significantly by 13.2%. The stock has underperformed the market recently, returning -12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%. Given the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the downward revision in EPS estimates, there seems to be more downside risk than upside potential in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news provides an analysis of Apple's Q1 outlook, with estimates of quarterly earnings and revenue. The consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, which may indicate a negative sentiment among analysts. However, the revenue estimates show a 3.7% year-over-year increase, which is a positive sign. The segment-wise estimates also show varying degrees of growth, with 'Net Sales- Services' expected to grow 13.2% year over year. Considering the mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.45, and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.55, given the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the recent -12.8% return of the stock over the past month.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance. However, the downward revision of earnings estimates by 1.1% in the last 30 days and the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating) suggest concerns. Additionally, a negative recent stock performance (-12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%) and the variety of mixed product and geographic revenue projections provide conflicting signals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are projected earnings and revenue growths of 8.3% and 3.7%, respectively, notable downside risks emerge from the recent 1.1% downward revision of the EPS estimate and the significant recent underperformance of the stock (-12.8% compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%). The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) signals potential further underperformance. While some segments show growth, the modest decline in iPhone revenue and negative geographic trends undermine the positives. Balancing these factors suggests more potential for a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook, with some positive growth projections offset by negative signals. The consistent downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days is concerning, suggesting analysts are becoming less optimistic. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating also indicates potential underperformance. While there's projected revenue growth, the iPhone revenue dip and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 add to the bearish sentiment. Across previous rounds, there is a consensus that the stock is more likely to fall. Based on the trend and weighting to recent negative outlook, more confidence is given on the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive aspects include projected year-over-year growth in earnings (8.3%) and revenue (3.7%), particularly strong growth in services (13.2%). However, several negative factors outweigh these positives.  The downward revision of the EPS estimate (-1.1% in 30 days) indicates weakening analyst confidence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) strongly suggests near-term underperformance.  The slight decline in projected iPhone revenue (-0.7%) is concerning, given its importance to Apple's overall revenue.  While some segments show growth, the negative EPS revision, recent poor stock performance (-12.8% vs. S&P 500's +1.1% in the last month), and the Zacks rating create significant downside risk.  Considering the preponderance of negative indicators and the consensus of previous models leaning towards a price fall, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive aspects include expected growth in quarterly earnings (8.3%) and revenues (3.7%), with strong performance in segments like Services (13.2% growth), Mac (7% growth), and Wearables (5% growth). However, negative factors include a downward revision of the consensus EPS estimate by 1.1% over the past 30 days, a slight decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), and underperformance in certain geographic regions like Rest of Asia Pacific (-2.5%) and Japan (-0.8%). Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently (-12.8% vs. +1.1%) and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential near-term underperformance. Given these mixed signals, the market reaction is likely to be cautious, with slightly higher risk of a price fall due to the negative revisions and recent underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. The company is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, up 8.3% year-over-year, and revenues of $124.04 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. However, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. The recent stock performance has been negative, with a -12.8% return over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%. While some segments like Services, Mac, and iPad show growth, others like iPhone revenue are expected to decline slightly. Considering these factors, the market reaction is likely to be cautious, with a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative revisions, recent underperformance, and analyst sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the provided financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) reveals mixed signals. On the positive side, the company is expected to show year-over-year growth in earnings per share (+8.3%) and overall revenue (+3.7%), with notable increases in segments like Services (+13.2%), Mac (+7%), and Wearables, Home and Accessories (+5%).

Additionally, the stock has underperformed recently with a -12.8% return over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%, and it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near term. Considering the predictions from other models, which range from 0.25 to 0.45 for the probability of the stock price rising, I will take a conservative approach and estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.4, given the mixed signals and recent underperformance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance. However, the downward revision of earnings estimates by 1.1% in the last 30 days, the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating), and the recent negative stock performance (-12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%) contribute to cautious sentiment. Although some product segments and regions like 'Net Sales- Services', 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' show significant growth, the overall market environment coupled with recent analyst downgrades and weak past performance could outweigh these positives.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of recent financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates a mixed outlook. Expected earnings and revenue growth are positive, with 8.3% growth in earnings per share and 3.7% revenue growth year-over-year. However, the recent downward revision of EPS estimates by 1.1% suggests weakening analyst confidence. Additionally, Apple's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) implies potential underperformance, particularly when coupled with the stock's recent decline of 12.8% versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.1%. The mixed performance across various segments, including a decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), further adds to the uncertainty regarding positive market reaction. Given these factors, the predictions indicate a higher probability of stock price falling over rising in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's Q1 outlook reveals a mixed bag of signals. While projected EPS and revenue show year-over-year growth, the downward revision of EPS estimates and recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further suggests potential underperformance. Although there's growth in services and certain geographic regions, the slight decline in iPhone revenue and negative trends provide conflicting signals. Considering the past predictions and the negative revision adjustments, there is moderate support that the stock is likely to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include projected earnings and revenue growth, and strong growth in services. However, several negative factors outweigh these positives. The downward revision of the EPS estimate (-1.1% in 30 days) indicates weakening analyst confidence. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) strongly suggests near-term underperformance. The slight decline in projected iPhone revenue (-0.7%) is concerning. The recent poor stock performance (-12.8% vs. S&P 500's +1.1% in the last month) also adds to the bearish sentiment.  The consensus among previous models leans towards a price fall.  While some positive growth is projected, the negative signals and recent market trends suggest a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, the company is expected to report year-over-year growth in earnings per share (8.3%) and revenue (3.7%), with strong performance in segments like Services (13.2% growth) and Mac (7% growth). However, there are significant negative factors, including a downward revision of the EPS estimate by 1.1% over the past 30 days, a slight decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), and underperformance in certain geographic regions. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently (-12.8% vs. +1.1%) and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential near-term underperformance. The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, given the negative revisions and recent underperformance. Balancing these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. The company is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, up 8.3% year-over-year, and revenues of $124.04 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. However, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. The recent stock performance has been negative, with a -12.8% return over the past month compared to the S&P500's +1.1%. While some segments like Services, Mac, and iPad show growth, others like iPhone revenue are expected to decline slightly. Considering these factors, the market reaction is likely to be cautious, with a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative revisions, recent underperformance, and analyst sentiment. Based on the consensus of previous models and the mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.38 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.62.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with projected earnings and revenue growth, but also a downward revision in EPS estimates, a slight decline in iPhone revenue, and underperformance in certain geographic regions. The stock's recent performance and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also suggest potential underperformance. Considering the mixed signals and weighing the negative factors, the probability of the stock price falling appears to be higher than the probability of it rising. The predictions from other models in previous rounds generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some variation in the estimated probabilities. Given the consistency of these predictions and the analysis of the news, a cautious approach is appropriate, estimating the probability of the stock price rising as 0.38 and the probability of it falling as 0.62.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) projects moderate year-over-year growth in earnings (8.3%) and revenue (3.7%), which typically indicates positive performance. However, several factors point towards caution: a 1.1% downward revision in the EPS estimate over the past 30 days, the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-12.8% vs. +1.1%), and the company\u2019s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. While there is robust growth anticipated in services and certain product segments, the slight decline in iPhone revenue and underperformance in some geographic regions add complexity. The recent negative revisions and market sentiment outweigh the positive indicators, with mixed signals leading to a balanced but slightly pessimistic outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is projected growth in earnings (8.3%) and revenue (3.7%), the recent downward revision in EPS estimates (-1.1%) indicates weakening analyst confidence. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests potential underperformance in the near term, particularly in light of Apple's recent stock performance of -12.8%, compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%. Additionally, the decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%) raises concerns as it is a critical revenue driver. Given the combination of these factors, there is a higher bias towards a price fall despite some positives in other segments. Thus, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.3 and the probability of it falling to be 0.7.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.33, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.67, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's Q1 outlook reveals a mixed picture. While there are projected year-over-year increases in both EPS and revenue, the downward revision of the EPS estimate and recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 are concerning. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also suggests potential underperformance, adding to the negative sentiment. Despite growth in services and some geographic regions, the slight decline in projected iPhone revenue creates additional uncertainty. Considering the trend in previous predictions and adjusting for sentiment from recent Zacks rank, a moderate weighting is given to those that weigh more negatively. The overall likelihood of a price fall seems slightly more probable than a rise, while a small chance it makes no movement at all (we don't address it here, since the prompt asks us about direction).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's Q1 outlook presents a mixed picture. While projected earnings and revenue show growth, a downward revision in EPS estimates and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) signal potential underperformance.  The slight decline in projected iPhone revenue is particularly concerning, given its importance to Apple's overall revenue. While growth in segments like Services is positive, the negative market sentiment (AAPL's recent underperformance) and analyst downgrades outweigh the positive indicators.  The consensus among previous model predictions consistently points towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering this information, and giving weight to the negative revisions and recent market performance, the probability of a price fall is judged higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc.

On the positive side, the company is expected to report year-over-year growth in earnings per share (8.3%) and revenue (3.7%), with strong performance in segments like Services (13.2% growth) and Mac (7% growth). However, there are significant negative factors, including a downward revision of the EPS estimate by 1.1% over the past 30 days, a slight decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), and underperformance in certain geographic regions. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently (-12.8% vs. +1.1%) and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating potential near-term underperformance. The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, given the negative revisions and recent underperformance. Balancing these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc.

However, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. The recent stock performance has been negative, with a -12.8% return over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%. While some segments like Services, Mac, and iPad show growth, others like iPhone revenue are expected to decline slightly.
