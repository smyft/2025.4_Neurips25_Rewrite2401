(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's upcoming earnings report shows expected growth in earnings and revenues, but there has been a downward revision in EPS estimates. This could lead to mixed investor sentiment. Additionally, Apple's recent performance, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggests caution. The estimated growth in key metrics reflects overall growth potential, but the revisions and recent price decrease may make investors skeptical. Thus, there is a higher probability of price decline given the recent trend and analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected earnings and revenue show modest growth, several key factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  Firstly, the consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, indicating weakening analyst confidence.  Secondly, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating strongly suggests underperformance.  Thirdly, the projected iPhone revenue shows a slight year-over-year decline (-0.7%), a crucial metric given the iPhone's significance to Apple's overall revenue. While some segments show growth (Services, Mac, Wearables, iPad, some geographic regions), the negative revision of EPS and the overall negative market sentiment (AAPL's -12.8% return vs S&P 500's +1.1% over the past month) outweigh the positive indicators. The overall picture is one of cautious optimism at best, given the significant negative market sentiment and downward EPS revision.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the provided financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) reveals mixed signals. On the positive side, the company is expected to show year-over-year growth in earnings per share (+8.3%) and overall revenue (+3.7%), with notable increases in segments like Services (+13.2%), Mac (+7%), and Wearables, Home and Accessories (+5%). However, there are concerns, including a downward revision of the EPS estimate by 1.1% over the past 30 days, a slight decline in iPhone revenue (-0.7%), and negative growth in some geographic regions like Rest of Asia Pacific (-2.5%) and Japan (-0.8%). Additionally, the stock has underperformed recently with a -12.8% return over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%, and it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance in the near term. Given these factors, the market reaction is likely to be cautious, balancing the positive earnings growth against the negative revisions and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple's Q1 performance. The company is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, an increase of 8.3% year-over-year, and revenues of $124.04 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. However, the consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, which could indicate potential negative sentiment. Specific segments like 'Net Sales- Products' are expected to grow slightly by 1.2%, while 'Net Sales- Services' are expected to grow significantly by 13.2%. The stock has underperformed the market recently, returning -12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%. Given the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the downward revision in EPS estimates, there seems to be more downside risk than upside potential in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news provides an analysis of Apple's Q1 outlook, with estimates of quarterly earnings and revenue. The consensus EPS estimate has been revised downward by 1.1% over the past 30 days, which may indicate a negative sentiment among analysts. However, the revenue estimates show a 3.7% year-over-year increase, which is a positive sign. The segment-wise estimates also show varying degrees of growth, with 'Net Sales- Services' expected to grow 13.2% year over year. Considering the mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.45, and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.55, given the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the recent -12.8% return of the stock over the past month.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance. However, the downward revision of earnings estimates by 1.1% in the last 30 days and the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating) suggest concerns. Additionally, a negative recent stock performance (-12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%) and the variety of mixed product and geographic revenue projections provide conflicting signals.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
