(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Gets Another Downgrade on iPhone Risk Ahead of Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was downgraded to perform from outperform at Oppenheimer, in the latest sign of caution building ahead of the company\u2019s results.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThis is at least the fifth downgrade Apple has received this month, following cuts from Jefferies, MoffettNathanson, Loop Capital, and DBS Bank. The cuts cement Apple\u2019s status as the least-loved megacap except Tesla Inc.\n\nLike the others, Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang cited concerns over iPhone sales in the downgrade, seeing \u201ca twofold challenge ahead for iPhone growth,\u201d including greater competition in China and a \u201clack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to accelerate near-term device replacement.\u201d\n\nIndependent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nShares fell 1.3% on Wednesday. While it remains down 9% from a December record, the stock is coming off a two-day gain of 7%, its largest two-day rally since June. This week\u2019s gain reflects how the emergence of China\u2019s artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek is seen as a positive for Apple, even as it weighed on tech broadly.\n\nApple reports its first-quarter results after the close on Thursday.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple has faced multiple downgrades from various analysts, indicating growing concerns over iPhone sales and increased competition, particularly in China. The downgrade from Oppenheimer, combined with the reported decline in iPhone sales, suggests a bearish outlook. While there was a recent two-day rally, the overall context of declining iPhone sales and multiple downgrades overshadows this short-term gain. Given these concerns and the upcoming earnings report, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Multiple downgrades citing concerns over iPhone sales, especially in China due to increased competition and a perceived lack of compelling AI applications, create strong headwinds. Independent research supports these concerns, showing significant iPhone sales declines in China. This negative sentiment is reflected in Wednesday's stock price decline. However, a recent two-day rally suggests that the market may be anticipating positive catalysts, perhaps related to AI integration or other aspects of the upcoming earnings report. The emergence of China\u2019s artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek is also seen as a positive for Apple. Given the balance of negative downgrades and recent positive sentiment, the probability of a price fall is slightly elevated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative sentiment towards Apple's stock. Multiple downgrades from various analysts cite concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  While a recent two-day rally suggests some positive market sentiment related to AI developments in China, the overwhelming negative outlook surrounding iPhone sales and the lack of compelling new Apple features significantly outweighs this. The fact that Apple is reporting earnings after the close on Thursday introduces additional volatility. Given the confluence of negative factors and the impending earnings report, the probability of a price drop is considered higher than a price rise.  However, the possibility of a positive surprise in the earnings report or continued positive sentiment around AI cannot be entirely disregarded, leading to probabilities below 100% for either outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades for Apple Inc. due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and lack of near-term growth drivers like AI. The stock has already seen recent volatility, with a 7% two-day gain followed by a 1.3% drop. Given the negative sentiment from analysts and poor iPhone sales data, the market is likely to react negatively to the news, especially ahead of earnings. However, some optimism around AI developments (e.g., China's DeepSeek) may provide minor support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Historically, downgrades tend to negatively impact stock prices. Additionally, Apple's iPhone sales have shown signs of decline, particularly in China, which could further pressure the stock price. However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, suggesting some resilience. Despite this, the overall sentiment from the downgrades and the concerns over iPhone sales growth suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc.'s stock by Oppenheimer, citing concerns over iPhone sales due to increased competition in China and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps. This is the fifth downgrade Apple has received this month, indicating a growing cautious sentiment among analysts. However, the stock has also experienced a recent two-day gain of 7% due to the emergence of China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, which is seen as a positive for Apple. Given the mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, as the downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales may outweigh the positive impact of the DeepSeek emergence.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades on Apple Inc., citing concerns over iPhone sales due to increased competition and lack of innovation. This pessimism among analysts suggests negative sentiments towards the company's performance. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report is expected to reflect these challenges. However, recent stock price recovery could indicate some optimism or short-term market reactions to other factors such as developments in Artificial Intelligence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis highlights significant concerns raised by multiple downgrades regarding Apple's iPhone sales, especially facing increased competition in China and a lack of compelling new applications. These factors have contributed to negative sentiment among analysts. Recent independent research indicates a notable decline in iPhone sales, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Although Apple recently experienced a short-term rally, the prevailing negative sentiment from the downgrades and upcoming earnings release suggests a higher likelihood of a price drop. Overall, the context of the downgrades outweighs short-term positive reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans bearish, driven by multiple downgrades based on iPhone sales concerns, especially in China, and perceived lack of AI innovation. While a recent two-day rally offered some counter-sentiment, the overall negative analyst outlook and looming earnings report suggest continued downward pressure. I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise, considering the stock's recent resilience and potential for a positive surprise during the earnings report or positive views on AI integration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The preponderance of evidence points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall for Apple.  Five downgrades this month from reputable financial institutions, citing weakening iPhone sales (especially a significant 18.2% drop in China), and concerns about a lack of compelling AI applications, strongly suggest negative market sentiment. While a recent two-day rally and the potential positive impact of China's DeepSeek AI startup offer some counter-narrative, these are overshadowed by the severity and consistency of the negative analyst assessments. The upcoming earnings report introduces further uncertainty and potential volatility, but the currently dominant bearish sentiment increases the likelihood of a negative reaction to the report, even if it's not drastically negative.\n\nConsidering the previous predictions, there's a clear clustering around a higher probability of a price fall.  While some models show slightly higher probabilities for a price rise (around 0.4), the majority leans towards a 0.7 probability or higher for a price fall. My prediction incorporates this consensus while acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in financial markets.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades for Apple Inc. due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and lack of near-term growth drivers like AI. The stock has already seen recent volatility, with a 7% two-day gain followed by a 1.3% drop. Given the negative sentiment from analysts and poor iPhone sales data, the market is likely to react negatively to the news, especially ahead of earnings. However, some optimism around AI developments (e.g., China's DeepSeek) may provide minor support. Considering the balance of negative downgrades and recent positive sentiment, the probability of a price fall is slightly elevated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

However, the stock has recently seen a 7% gain over two days, suggesting some resilience.

Considering the consensus from multiple analysts and the recent sales data, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article reports a fifth downgrade for Apple Inc. this month, citing concerns over iPhone sales due to increased competition in China and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps. This growing cautious sentiment among analysts, combined with independent research indicating an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the stock experienced a recent two-day gain of 7% due to the emergence of China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, the overall negative sentiment from multiple downgrades and poor iPhone sales data is expected to outweigh this positive factor. Considering the analysis and the trend of others' predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades on Apple Inc., citing concerns over iPhone sales due to increased competition, especially in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI applications. These downgrades, along with independent research showing a decline in iPhone sales, suggest a negative outlook. While there has been a recent two-day rally due to AI developments, it appears to be overshadowed by the prevailing negative sentiment. Given the confluence of negative factors and the impending earnings report, the probability of a stock price fall is considered higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer, following several other downgrades this month, highlights significant concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in the competitive Chinese market. The report indicating an 18.2% drop in iPhone sales during the December quarter adds to the negative sentiment. Additionally, analysts cited a lack of compelling new applications as a factor in the downgrade. Although there was a recent two-day stock rally, this was followed by a decline, reflecting market apprehension ahead of the upcoming earnings report. Given the consistent bearish outlook from various analysts, the probability of the stock price falling is assessed to be higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Taking into account the previous rounds' predictions, the news headline indicating another downgrade for Apple due to iPhone risks, and the detailed news content, my prediction leans towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling. The consistent downgrades from multiple firms due to concerns over iPhone sales, especially in the Chinese market, and the perceived lack of compelling AI features, weigh heavily on investor sentiment. While there was a temporary rally, the underlying concerns about iPhone sales persist. The upcoming earnings report introduces volatility, but the prevailing negative sentiment increases the likelihood of a negative reaction. The slight dip in the stock on Wednesday also reinforces this sentiment. The consensus from previous predictions points towards a higher likelihood of a price fall. I am slightly more optimistic than the majority, seeing possible upsides from the AI developments. Thus I will put the probability of stock falling a bit lower than others. Even though the others put the probability of rising lower, note that the overall trend is that they are slowly increasing the probalility of rising, which indicates they may have some information that is positive about the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Multiple downgrades from reputable firms cite declining iPhone sales, particularly a significant drop in China (18.2%), and a lack of compelling AI applications to drive future growth.  While a recent two-day rally and the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI startup offer some counter-narrative suggesting potential positive sentiment related to AI development, these positive factors are significantly outweighed by the persistent negative sentiment surrounding iPhone sales. The consensus among previous prediction models also leans heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, but the current negative sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a negative market reaction to even a moderately positive earnings announcement. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has received multiple downgrades from analysts, with concerns primarily focused on iPhone sales, especially in China, and a lack of compelling AI applications. This has resulted in negative sentiment among investors. Despite a recent two-day rally, the overall outlook appears bearish due to the downgrades and poor sales data. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.

Multiple downgrades from reputable financial institutions, combined with independent research showing significant declines in iPhone sales, strongly suggest negative market sentiment. While there have been some positive reactions to AI developments, such as the emergence of China's DeepSeek, these are largely overshadowed by the severity and consistency of the negative analyst assessments.
