This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Greenlight Capital's update indicates mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. The mention of Apple in the investor letter suggests some level of confidence, but the overall market valuation concerns and their shift towards AI stocks may signal caution. The historical performance shows a recent decline for Apple, with a -13.59% return over one month, which may weigh on investor sentiment. However, the long-term growth potential remains significant, as indicated by the company's annual revenue increase of 6%. Given these factors, there is a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a substantial chance of it falling given market uncertainty and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed regarding Apple (AAPL). While Greenlight Capital holds Apple, they express concern about overall market valuation and believe AI stocks offer potentially higher and faster returns. They acknowledge Apple's strengths (revenue growth, hedge fund popularity) but their primary focus is elsewhere. The mention of 'disappointing' data and 'expensive' stock from Dan Niles adds a negative sentiment. Furthermore, the article highlights a decrease in the number of hedge funds holding AAPL from the previous quarter, suggesting a possible shift in investment sentiment. Lastly, Apple's recent one-month negative return (-13.59%) hints at potential short-term downward pressure. Therefore, while long-term prospects for Apple are probably still good, the article's immediate tone suggests a higher probability of a price decline in the short term than a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Greenlight Capital, while holding Apple stock, expresses concerns about overall market valuation and prefers AI stocks.  Their reduced market exposure and the mention of Apple being 'pretty expensive' by an analyst (Dan Niles) suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Although Apple's revenue is up, the hedge fund's preference for AI and concerns about valuation outweigh the positive revenue news.  The decline in hedge fund ownership from the previous quarter further supports a cautious outlook. The one-month return of -13.59% also indicates recent negative market sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short-term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the mixed signals from the news. Greenlight Capital expressed concerns about market valuation and specifically mentioned Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. However, the stock gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks, showing long-term strength. The mention of Apple being in the top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, albeit with a decrease in hedge fund holdings, provides some neutral context. Overall, the negative short-term performance and bearish comments from Greenlight Capital outweigh the long-term gains and hedge fund interest, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's concerns about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article highlights that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating a recent decline in stock price. However, it also mentions that Apple's shares gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks, showing long-term growth. The mixed signals and concerns about valuation are likely to create uncertainty among investors. Given the recent decline and concerns about high valuation, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the stock price falling or remaining stable with a lower chance of a significant rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. However, the tone of the letter is cautious, with concerns about the overall valuation of the market and Apple's stock being 'pretty expensive'. The article also mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59% and that the fund's daily correlation to the S&P 500 was 0.01, indicating a low correlation. Additionally, the article highlights the potential of AI stocks, which may be seen as a competitor to Apple's growth prospects. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Greenlight Capital's low net market exposure and concerns about valuation suggest caution, while on the other hand, Apple remains a popular choice among hedge funds. Additionally, Apple's recent performance indicates a one-month decline of -13.59%, which could imply that further declines could be expected. However, Apple's strong revenue growth continues to demonstrate business stability, potentially supporting a rise in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent investor letter from Greenlight Capital indicates a cautious approach to Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing concerns about overall market valuation and mentioning that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive' according to Dan Niles. This suggests bearish sentiment towards AAPL in the short term. Additionally, Apple's one-month return has been significantly negative at -13.59%, which could further affect investor sentiment. Although Apple has shown positive long-term performance with a 15.28% increase over the last year, the immediate outlook appears tempered by concerns over recent data and the attraction of AI stocks. Overall, these factors yield a higher probability of the stock price falling relative to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple in the provided news and previous predictions remains mixed, but leans slightly negative. Greenlight Capital holds Apple, but expresses concerns about valuation and favors AI stocks for faster gains. The one-month return of -13.59% is a significant negative indicator. Previous predictions have consistently favored a price fall, with the majority assigning a higher probability to a downward movement. Even though Apple remains a popular hedge fund holding and has shown long-term growth, the current market conditions, valuation concerns, and disappointing recent performance suggest continued downward pressure. The consistent bearish prediction across multiple models and rounds reinforces this view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Greenlight Capital still holds AAPL, their expressed concerns about market valuation and preference for AI stocks suggest a bearish sentiment.  The negative one-month return (-13.59%) and comments describing Apple as 'pretty expensive' further support this.  Conversely, Apple's long-term growth (15.28% 52-week gain) and continued revenue growth offer a counterpoint. However, the overall tone leans negative due to the combination of valuation concerns, preference for AI investments, and the recent price drop.  The consensus among previous models also points towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Therefore, considering all factors, the probability of a price fall is deemed to be slightly higher than the probability of a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Greenlight Capital's investor letter highlights concerns about overall market valuation and specifically labels Apple's stock as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data, which could dampen investor sentiment. The recent one-month return of -13.59% further underscores short-term underperformance. However, Apple's long-term growth is evident with a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and a 6% revenue increase in the September quarter. While the company remains popular among hedge funds, the decrease in hedge fund holdings from the previous quarter suggests a shift in sentiment. The emphasis on AI stocks as more promising investments also diverts attention from Apple. Given these factors, the negative short-term indicators and cautious tone from Greenlight Capital outweigh the long-term positives, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The financial news from Greenlight Capital presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Greenlight Capital continues to hold Apple stock, they express concerns about the overall market valuation and specifically mention that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data. Additionally, Apple's recent one-month return was -13.59%, indicating short-term underperformance. However, Apple's long-term growth remains strong, with a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and a 6% revenue increase in the September quarter. The decrease in hedge fund ownership and preference for AI stocks over Apple also suggests a cautious outlook. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term due to negative sentiment and valuation concerns, but long-term prospects remain positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article from Greenlight Capital's investor letter expresses concerns about the overall valuation of the market and specifically notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. This, combined with Apple's recent one-month return of -13.59%, suggests a bearish sentiment towards the stock in the short term. However, Apple's long-term growth prospects, as indicated by its 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and its position as one of the most popular stocks among hedge funds, provide a counterbalance to the negative sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the preference of Greenlight Capital for AI stocks, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising, but the long-term stability and growth of Apple should not be overlooked. Given the range of predictions from other models, which generally favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, a balanced estimate reflecting the uncertainty and mixed sentiments in the market is appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Greenlight Capital continues to hold Apple, they express significant concerns about the overall market valuation, noting Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data. Additionally, Apple's recent performance indicates a one-month decline of -13.59%, which could imply a continued bearish sentiment. The declining interest from hedge funds further underscores caution. Despite Greenlight Capital acknowledging Apple's market presence, their focus on AI stocks suggests they see better opportunities for returns elsewhere. The combination of high valuation concerns and recent negative short-term performance outweighs the positive long-term revenue growth.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent updates from Greenlight Capital indicate a cautious outlook on Apple Inc. due to high market valuation and concerns regarding its price being 'pretty expensive.' Furthermore, the stock has experienced a significant one-month decline of -13.59%, which adds to the bearish sentiment. Although Apple has shown long-term growth with a 15.28% increase over the last 52 weeks and is still held by many hedge funds, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions leans negative. Overall, the combination of recent poor performance, concerns from influential investors, and a focus on alternative investments like AI stocks suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple continues to be mixed but leans bearish. Greenlight Capital's concerns about market valuation and their preference for AI stocks over Apple suggest a cautious outlook. Although the fund still holds Apple, the emphasis on AI highlights a potential shift in investment strategy. The consistent negative one-month return (-13.59%) and the analyst quote labeling Apple as 'pretty expensive' reinforces the negative sentiment. Previous rounds of predictions consistently favored a price decrease. Furthermore, the decrease in hedge fund ownership, although remaining substantial, could indicate a gradual shift in institutional sentiment. I am adjusting the probability slightly from the previous rounds to reflect the consensus and recent performance, leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed.  Greenlight Capital, while still holding AAPL, expresses significant concerns about overall market valuation and explicitly states Apple is 'pretty expensive' and its performance is 'somewhat disappointing'.  This bearish sentiment is reinforced by Apple's recent one-month return of -13.59%.  The decrease in hedge fund ownership further points to a shift in sentiment.  While Apple's long-term growth (15.28% 52-week gain and 6% revenue increase) is undeniable, the immediate concerns from a prominent investor and the recent price drop dominate the short-term outlook.  The consensus among previous predictions heavily leans towards a price fall.  Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise in the short term. The longer-term picture is less clear, but the immediate reaction is more likely to be negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple remains a significant holding for Greenlight Capital and has shown long-term growth with a 15.28% gain over the last 52 weeks and a 6% revenue increase in the September quarter. However, the investor letter from Greenlight Capital indicates concerns about overall market valuation, with specific mention of Apple's stock being 'pretty expensive' and 'somewhat disappointing' data, suggesting bearish sentiment in the short term. The recent one-month return of -13.59% further supports this cautious outlook. Additionally, the preference for AI stocks over Apple and a decrease in hedge fund ownership from the previous quarter indicate a shift in investor sentiment. Given these factors, while Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the negative short-term indicators and cautious tone from Greenlight Capital suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the mixed signals from the news. Greenlight Capital expressed concerns about market valuation and specifically mentioned Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. However, Apple has shown positive long-term performance with a 15.28% increase over the last 52 weeks, showing long-term strength. The mention of Apple being in the top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds, albeit with a decrease in hedge fund holdings, provides some neutral context. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which generally favor a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns over valuation, recent performance, and the attraction of AI stocks, the estimated probabilities are derived. The overall sentiment leans towards a cautious outlook, with a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Greenlight Capital continues to hold Apple, they express significant concerns about the overall market valuation, noting Apple as 'pretty expensive' with 'somewhat disappointing' data.

The declining interest from hedge funds further underscores caution. Despite Greenlight Capital acknowledging Apple's market presence, their focus on AI stocks suggests they see better opportunities for returns elsewhere.

(AAPL), emphasizing concerns over high market valuation and labeling the stock as 'pretty expensive.' Coupled with a significant one-month decline of -13.59%, investor sentiment appears bearish in the short term. Despite Apple's long-term growth of 15.28% over the last 52 weeks and a stable revenue increase of 6%, the immediate concerns regarding valuation and a notable shift in hedge fund interest towards AI stocks indicate a higher likelihood of a price decline. Overall, the prevailing negative sentiment and recent performance suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: After analyzing the provided news and considering the previous predictions, my assessment is that the sentiment towards Apple (AAPL) remains cautiously negative. Greenlight Capital's concerns about the high market valuation and their preference for AI stocks, coupled with the recent one-month decline of -13.59%, weigh heavily on the stock's outlook. Although Apple exhibits long-term growth and continues to be a popular hedge fund holding, the increasing emphasis on AI stocks and the decreasing hedge fund interest paint a less optimistic picture for the near future. The consensus from previous rounds largely suggests a likely price fall. Therefore, I am slightly increasing the probability of the stock price falling to reflect this bearish short term outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is overwhelmingly bearish.  While Greenlight Capital still holds AAPL, their expressed concerns about overall market valuation and their preference for AI stocks significantly outweigh any positive sentiment.  The description of Apple as 'pretty expensive' and the 'somewhat disappointing' data, coupled with the negative one-month return (-13.59%), point to a considerable likelihood of a short-term price decline.
