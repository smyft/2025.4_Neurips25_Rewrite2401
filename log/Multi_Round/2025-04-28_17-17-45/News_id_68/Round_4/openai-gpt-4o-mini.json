(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why RDDT Is Rising for a Second Straight Day\nNews Content: Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mainly discusses Reddit's stock performance and an upgrade from Piper Sandler, highlighting positive changes that may boost advertiser interest in Reddit. While this news does not directly impact Apple's stock, the context suggests increased engagement on social media platforms may indirectly benefit companies like Apple, especially in advertising and app monetization. Given the positive sentiment surrounding Reddit, one could infer that investors' confidence in tech stocks, including AI-related companies like Apple, may rise. However, there is also a bearish note from Roth Capital that suggests potential revenue slowdowns for RDDT, which could create volatility in tech stocks overall. This uncertainty warrants a cautious viewpoint, leading to a moderate estimate for both upward and downward movement for Apple\u2019s stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and does not contain any significantly impactful information regarding Apple (AAPL) other than Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" Rating and anticipating AI benefits driving future growth. This is a moderate positive indicator; however, the analysis on Reddit is far more extensive. The overall impact on Apple is limited since it only references the opinion from Evercore ISI that Apple's artificial intelligence investment provides future value. Unless investors specifically look into Evercore ISI and analyze their historical reliability, price projections are only opinions and will thus likely have a very moderate impact on the change in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  The analysis of RDDT's potential for growth based on increased advertising revenue is presented with counterpoints suggesting deceleration in user growth and revenue. While the news could influence investor sentiment towards social media stocks, there is no direct impact on Apple's stock price predicted in this article. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is assumed to be unaffected by this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content primarily discuss Reddit (RDDT) and its recent performance due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers. There is no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the news content except for a brief reference to Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL, citing AI benefits as a future growth driver. Since the news does not provide significant new information or catalysts specific to AAPL, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral or minimal. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance of the news to AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for attracting more advertisers due to a technical update, which could lead to increased revenue growth. However, the article also mentions that another investment bank, Evercore ISI, maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing AI benefits that could drive future growth. The news directly related to AAPL is positive, as it indicates a favorable outlook from a significant investment bank. Given this positive outlook and the lack of directly negative news about AAPL, it is reasonable to infer a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertising revenue due to a technical update. The mention of Apple Inc. is indirect, through a separate note from Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL due to AI benefits driving future growth. Since the news does not directly impact AAPL's stock price, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are not significantly altered by this specific news article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) recent positive developments and performance, including an expected increase in ad revenue due to improved ad campaign replication on their platform. There's no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there's an optimistic note from Everbank ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on Apple, citing AI benefits driving future growth. The news about RDDT does not directly correlate with AAPL's stock price, but the overall optimism around AI and technology could indirectly influence sentiments towards tech giants like Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the stock movement of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertising revenue through a technical update. Although there is a mention of Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating for Apple (AAPL) due to benefits from AI, the direct impact on Apple's stock price appears minimal. The general sentiment surrounding tech stocks may still be positive, suggesting that the optimism about RDDT could spill over into perceptions of tech stocks in general, including Apple. However, due to the largely indirect nature of the news related to AAPL, I estimate moderate probabilities for both rising and falling stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT), discussing a potential increase in advertising revenue due to a technical update and analyst upgrades. However, Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple (AAPL), citing AI benefits. This positive, albeit brief, mention of Apple is somewhat overshadowed by the more detailed discussion of Reddit. Considering the previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, leaning slightly towards a neutral impact on Apple's stock, I'll adjust my prediction to be slightly more optimistic than perfectly neutral to reflect Evercore ISI's opinion. But considering also the opinion of other predictions trending towards a lower impact, I'll make the change conservative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT), with only tangential relevance to Apple (AAPL).  While Evercore ISI maintains an 'Outperform' rating for AAPL, citing AI benefits, this is not new information and doesn't significantly alter the existing market sentiment towards Apple.  The positive news about Reddit is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price, and the lack of any negative news about Apple means no downward pressure is expected. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the limited impact of this news.  Considering this lack of direct impact and the overall neutral to slightly positive market sentiment around AI, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, although it remains close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit's (RDDT) stock performance and potential ad revenue growth due to technical updates, with minimal direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there is a brief reference to Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL, citing AI benefits as a driver for future growth. This is a positive indicator for AAPL, albeit not strongly emphasized in the article. Given the lack of significant direct news impacting AAPL and the mild positive sentiment from the Evercore ISI note, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price movement are expected to remain relatively neutral, with a slight tilt towards optimism due to the AI-related outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article primarily discusses Reddit's (RDDT) potential for growth due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers, and also mentions Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to AI benefits driving future growth. Since the news does not directly impact Apple's stock price, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are not significantly altered by this specific news article. However, considering the indirect optimism around AI and technology, there could be a slight positive influence on sentiments towards tech giants like Apple. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but most of them suggest a neutral or slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertiser interest and revenue growth. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned briefly as being maintained as 'Outperform' by Evercore ISI due to AI benefits, this information is not substantial enough to significantly impact AAPL's stock price. The overall market sentiment from the news appears neutral towards AAPL, considering the mixed signals from various investment banks and the focus being on a different company.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit's performance and potential growth, with only a brief mention of Apple's favorable 'Outperform' rating from Evercore ISI due to AI benefits. While Reddit's positive momentum could enhance sentiment in the tech sector, the lack of direct correlation to Apple's performance leads to a moderate outlook. Given the slight optimism around AI and the absence of negative news, I estimate a slightly positive probability for Apple's stock price to rise, though it remains close to neutral overall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential increase in ad revenue due to technical updates. Apple (AAPL) is only tangentially mentioned with Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating, citing AI benefits. This positive mention is not new information and is unlikely to cause significant movement in AAPL's stock price. Most prior predictions hovered around neutral with a slight lean towards a rise. I'll slightly decrease my prediction from the previous round to reflect the continued ambiguous impact on AAPL., with more consistent neutral sentiment across analysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) stock performance and potential for increased advertising revenue. While there's a brief mention of Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating for Apple (AAPL) due to AI benefits, this is not a significant new catalyst for Apple's stock.  The indirect connection to Apple, coupled with the mostly neutral to slightly positive sentiment around AI within the tech sector, should have a minimal impact on Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions further corroborate this, showing a wide range but mostly hovering around a neutral impact on AAPL.  The lack of substantial direct news related to Apple makes a large price swing in either direction unlikely. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outlook, slightly favoring a potential rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the AI field and the Evercore ISI rating.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertising revenue due to a technical update, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating, citing AI benefits for future growth. Since the news does not provide any new or substantial information directly impacting Apple, the effect on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mild positive sentiment from the Evercore ISI note, the probabilities for AAPL's stock price movement remain close to neutral, with a slight tilt towards optimism due to the AI-related outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertising revenue due to a technical update. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned briefly with Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating, citing AI benefits as a driver for future growth. This positive note on AAPL, although brief, suggests a favorable outlook. However, given that the news is largely centered on RDDT and not directly on AAPL, the impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities but generally indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook for AAPL. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the positive mention of AAPL, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Reddit's (RDDT) potential for growth due to a technical update and its impact on advertising revenue. Although Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned briefly with Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating due to AI benefits, the direct impact on Apple's stock price appears minimal. Considering the indirect optimism around AI and technology, there could be a slight positive influence on sentiments towards tech giants like Apple. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities but most suggest a neutral or slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Given the lack of significant direct news impacting AAPL and the mild positive sentiment from the Evercore ISI note, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price movement are expected to remain relatively neutral, with a slight tilt towards optimism due to the AI-related outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertiser interest and revenue growth. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned briefly as being maintained as 'Outperform' by Evercore ISI due to AI benefits, this information is not substantial enough to significantly impact AAPL's stock price. The overall market sentiment from the news appears neutral towards AAPL, considering the mixed signals from various investment banks and the focus being on a different company. Previous model predictions ranged widely, but many indicated a slight positive or neutral outlook for AAPL. The current news offers limited direct impact on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit's recent performance and potential for advertising revenue growth, which could indirectly benefit tech stocks like Apple due to increased market optimism. However, the coverage on Apple is limited to Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating, which although positive, does not present new catalysts for significant price movement. Overall, the sentiment towards Apple appears cautiously optimistic, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase despite limited direct impact from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth in advertising revenue, spurred by a technical update. Apple (AAPL) is only mentioned indirectly with Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating, citing AI benefits. This indirect and non-substantial information suggests limited direct impact on AAPL's stock price movement. The previous rounds of predictions reflect this sentiment, clustering around a neutral outlook with a slight tendency toward a rise. I am decreasing my prediction slightly from the previous rounds, but adhering to trend analysis, I am increasing the probability of the stock price rising due to it's relatively favorable impact on the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Reddit's (RDDT) stock performance and potential growth, with only tangential relevance to Apple (AAPL).  While a positive Evercore ISI outlook on AAPL, citing AI benefits, exists, it's not a significant new catalyst.  Reddit's performance is unlikely to directly impact Apple significantly. The previous model predictions show a wide range, primarily clustering around a neutral or slightly positive impact on AAPL's stock price.  Considering the lack of substantial direct news about Apple and the overall mixed signals, a neutral probability is the most reasonable estimate, with only a slight tilt towards a potential price rise due to the positive sentiment around AI, but not enough to justify a significant deviation from neutrality.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertising revenue due to a technical update, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc.
