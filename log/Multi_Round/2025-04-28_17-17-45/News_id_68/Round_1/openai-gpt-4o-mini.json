(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why RDDT Is Rising for a Second Straight Day\nNews Content: Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mainly discusses Reddit's stock performance and an upgrade from Piper Sandler, highlighting positive changes that may boost advertiser interest in Reddit. While this news does not directly impact Apple's stock, the context suggests increased engagement on social media platforms may indirectly benefit companies like Apple, especially in advertising and app monetization. Given the positive sentiment surrounding Reddit, one could infer that investors' confidence in tech stocks, including AI-related companies like Apple, may rise. However, there is also a bearish note from Roth Capital that suggests potential revenue slowdowns for RDDT, which could create volatility in tech stocks overall. This uncertainty warrants a cautious viewpoint, leading to a moderate estimate for both upward and downward movement for Apple\u2019s stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and does not contain any significantly impactful information regarding Apple (AAPL) other than Evercore ISI maintaining an \"Outperform\" Rating and anticipating AI benefits driving future growth. This is a moderate positive indicator; however, the analysis on Reddit is far more extensive. The overall impact on Apple is limited since it only references the opinion from Evercore ISI that Apple's artificial intelligence investment provides future value. Unless investors specifically look into Evercore ISI and analyze their historical reliability, price projections are only opinions and will thus likely have a very moderate impact on the change in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  The analysis of RDDT's potential for growth based on increased advertising revenue is presented with counterpoints suggesting deceleration in user growth and revenue. While the news could influence investor sentiment towards social media stocks, there is no direct impact on Apple's stock price predicted in this article. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is assumed to be unaffected by this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content primarily discuss Reddit (RDDT) and its recent performance due to a technical update that may attract more advertisers. There is no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the news content except for a brief reference to Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL, citing AI benefits as a future growth driver. Since the news does not provide significant new information or catalysts specific to AAPL, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral or minimal. The probabilities are based on the lack of direct relevance of the news to AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for attracting more advertisers due to a technical update, which could lead to increased revenue growth. However, the article also mentions that another investment bank, Evercore ISI, maintains an 'Outperform' rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing AI benefits that could drive future growth. The news directly related to AAPL is positive, as it indicates a favorable outlook from a significant investment bank. Given this positive outlook and the lack of directly negative news about AAPL, it is reasonable to infer a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather discusses Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for increased advertising revenue due to a technical update. The mention of Apple Inc. is indirect, through a separate note from Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on AAPL due to AI benefits driving future growth. Since the news does not directly impact AAPL's stock price, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are not significantly altered by this specific news article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) recent positive developments and performance, including an expected increase in ad revenue due to improved ad campaign replication on their platform. There's no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, there's an optimistic note from Everbank ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating on Apple, citing AI benefits driving future growth. The news about RDDT does not directly correlate with AAPL's stock price, but the overall optimism around AI and technology could indirectly influence sentiments towards tech giants like Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
