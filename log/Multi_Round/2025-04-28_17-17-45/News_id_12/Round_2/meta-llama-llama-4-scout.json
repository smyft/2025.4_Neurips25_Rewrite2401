A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes, including those that often influence tech stocks like Apple Inc., have risen due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure aligning with expectations. This typically suggests a stable economic outlook, which is generally positive for large corporations like Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising as investor sentiment may be positively affected by the overall market trend. However, there remains some uncertainty in the market, so the probability of a price fall, though lower, cannot be ruled out entirely.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are rising because the Fed's preferred inflation gauge came in line with expectations. This suggests that the market is reacting positively to the news, likely because it reduces concerns about further aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Since Apple is a major company in the US equity indexes, a general positive sentiment in the market will likely boost its stock price. Also, since I'm blocked from accessing premium content, I am assuming that the rest of the article simply provides data backing the headline, such as the actual inflation data. Therefore, my probabilities will be skewed towards the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose because the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge met expectations.  This is generally positive news for the stock market as it suggests that inflation may be under control, reducing the likelihood of further aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed.  Since Apple is a major component of the US equity indexes, it's likely to be positively influenced by this overall market trend. However, without access to the full news article, it's impossible to determine if there's any specific news pertaining to Apple itself that might influence its price independently.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher, but a significant portion of uncertainty remains due to the limited news information. I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise due to the positive market-wide sentiment indicated by the headline, but acknowledging that unforeseen factors could impact the price negatively.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, as inflation data in line with expectations reduces uncertainty about future monetary policy actions. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a major component of US equity indexes, is likely to benefit from this broader market uplift. Given the positive reaction of the market to the inflation data and Apple's strong correlation with major indexes, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall. However, since the full news content is not available, the analysis is based on the limited information provided.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in line with expectations. This suggests a positive market reaction to the news, which could imply that stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), might experience a price increase due to the overall favorable market conditions. Since the news is neutral to positive for the market and does not contain any negative information specific to Apple, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price of AAPL has a higher chance of rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes rose after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations. This suggests a positive market reaction to the inflation data, which is likely to have a favorable impact on the stock market, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). As a major component of the US equity indexes, Apple's stock price is likely to benefit from the overall positive market sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes rose because the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure matched expectations. This suggests a positive outlook on the macroeconomic conditions, which typically can have a broad positive impact on most stocks including Apple Inc. However, since Apple's specific performance might also depend on its own financial health, product developments, and other company-specific factors, the direct influence of this news on AAPL might be moderate.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The recent news indicates a positive sentiment in the market as US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge aligning with expectations. This generally suggests a stable economic environment, reducing concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes, which is favorable for stocks, particularly for major players like Apple Inc. (AAPL). As Apple is a significant component of US indexes, it is likely to benefit from this overall positive market sentiment. Previous predictions have been consistently high for stock price rises, indicating a strong consensus about favorable outcomes. Therefore, I estimate a high probability that Apple's stock price will rise while a lower probability for it to fall, acknowledging some uncertainty due to possible unforeseen factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment driven by inflation data meeting expectations, which generally benefits large companies like Apple (AAPL). Previous models have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. Considering this consensus and without any company-specific counter-indicators, I am leaning towards a higher probability of a rise. However, the absence of detailed news content encourages me to be slightly more conservative than the most optimistic predictions. And the previous predictions indicate mostly unchanged belief toward the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the market, as inflation coming in line with expectations reduces uncertainty and suggests the Fed may not need to aggressively raise interest rates further. This positive market sentiment is likely to lift Apple's stock price, given its significant influence in the US equity indexes.  Previous model predictions consistently show a higher probability of a rise than a fall (mostly around 0.7 rise / 0.3 fall).  While the lack of access to the full article introduces uncertainty, the overall positive market trend heavily influences the prediction. The consensus points towards a moderately higher probability of a stock price increase, but some risk of a price fall remains due to other potential unforeseen factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market reaction to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure meeting expectations, which generally bodes well for US equity indexes. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of these indexes, the overall positive sentiment is likely to influence its stock price positively. Previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with most assigning a 0.6 to 0.7 probability for a rise and 0.3 to 0.4 for a fall. The consensus suggests that while the news is broadly favorable, there remains some uncertainty, possibly due to lack of access to the full article or company-specific factors. Considering the general market uplift and the alignment of previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure met expectations. This generally positive news suggests that inflation may be under control, reducing the likelihood of further aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the US equity indexes, it is likely to be positively influenced by this overall market trend. The consensus among various predictions is that the stock price has a higher chance of rising than falling, with probabilities of a rise ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. Considering the positive market sentiment and Apple's strong correlation with major indexes, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes rose as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in line with expectations, suggesting a stable economic outlook which is generally positive for large corporations like Apple Inc. The overall positive market sentiment is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which show a general consensus towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, it's reasonable to estimate a higher probability of a price rise than a fall. However, acknowledging some uncertainty in the market and potential unforeseen factors, the probability of a price fall, though lower, cannot be ruled out entirely.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes rose due to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure meeting expectations. This suggests a stable economic environment and reduced uncertainty regarding future monetary policy actions, which is generally positive for large corporations like Apple Inc. While all models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the improved market sentiment, it's important to consider the broader context and potential factors that could affect Apple's specific situation, such as product launches, sales figures, and competitive landscape.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
