This suggests that the market is reacting positively to the news, likely because it reduces concerns about further aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Since Apple is a major company in the US equity indexes, a general positive sentiment in the market will likely boost its stock price. Also, since I'm blocked from accessing premium content, I am assuming that the rest of the article simply provides data backing the headline, such as the actual inflation data.
