(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around TikTok's service disruption due to a new law that impacts its availability in the US, potentially increasing the competitive landscape for social media platforms. While TikTok faces challenges, companies like Meta and Snap may benefit. However, Apple's involvement as a gatekeeper in this situation could create uncertainty due to potential regulatory pressures. Given that the narrative involves TikTok, which competes with Apple's App Store for traffic and ad revenues, and that Apple's compliance with the law is in question, there may be mixed reactions. Therefore, while some may view the situation positively, others may be concerned about legal and market ramifications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news is somewhat neutral to slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While the situation with TikTok itself doesn't directly impact Apple's core business, the fact that Trump is stepping in to potentially allow TikTok to continue operating in the US averts a negative scenario for Apple. Banning the TikTok application would have damaged Apple's reputation, potentially causing public outrage and reduced confidence in the stock. The lack of an app ban doesn't necessarily mean positive sentiment for Apple, but it suggests averted negative effects. The longer-term implications of TikTok's future are uncertain, given congressional opposition and potential future regulatory changes. As such, the stock price is unlikely to be significantly impacted in either positive or negative direction. It is important to note that the Apple app store is not completely safe, since there remains a possibility of a ban in the future which creates uncertainty. Additionally, the news cycle continues to affect Apple and TikTok, so Apple's stock price may fluctuate due to the ongoing political considerations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the initial shutdown might have suggested a potential positive impact on Apple (AAPL) due to reduced competition from TikTok's advertising revenue, the subsequent restoration significantly diminishes this effect. The article highlights the uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok and the possibility that Trump's actions might not be legally sustainable. Although there is speculation that Meta (META) and other platforms might benefit from TikTok's absence, this shift doesn't directly translate into a significant positive impact on Apple's stock. The legal uncertainty surrounding the TikTok ban and its potential future reversals creates a volatile situation. Therefore, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, with the probabilities of a rise or fall being relatively balanced.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on the TikTok ban and its implications for various tech companies, including Apple. Apple's stock price could be indirectly affected by the TikTok ban as it impacts the App Store's revenue and user engagement. However, the news also mentions Trump's willingness to provide a reprieve, which could mitigate negative impacts. Given the uncertainty and mixed signals, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown of TikTok in the US due to a new law banning the app, and the subsequent restoration of service after President Trump provided clarity and assurance to TikTok's service providers. The article also mentions the potential implications for other companies, such as Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest, if TikTok is eventually banned. However, the company directly mentioned in the context of the stock price movement is Apple, as the article mentions that TikTok was unavailable via Apple's App Store. Given that the news does not have a direct negative impact on Apple's business, and the fact that the shutdown of TikTok might even drive more traffic to other social media platforms available on Apple's App Store, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US, as a result of President Trump's directive to allow service providers to avoid penalties if they continue supporting TikTok. This could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple Inc., as they are one of the key platform providers for TikTok. However, there is uncertainty because several high-ranking officials have stated their opposition, suggesting future challenges might arise. On the other hand, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta may benefit, which could indirectly impact Apple's positioning in the market.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news surrounding TikTok's temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration ostensibly positions Apple (AAPL) as a gatekeeper in this scenario. While the ban might seem like a potential win for Apple, given that TikTok\u2019s absence could drive users to other apps available in the App Store, the reality is more complex due to the uncertain legal landscape and the reactions from key political figures. Trump's interventions may suggest a stabilization for TikTok, potentially reducing any direct risk to Apple\u2019s App Store revenues. However, the ongoing regulatory discussions could inject volatility into Apple\u2019s stock performance. Based on these mixed signals and the previous predictive trends, a moderately positive sentiment is expected. Therefore, probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a rise in stock price, albeit with significant uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's uncertain status in the US introduces both potential benefits and risks for Apple. The temporary ban and subsequent restoration create volatility in the social media landscape. On one hand, a TikTok ban could lead to increased app store revenue for Apple and potentially drive users to other platforms within its ecosystem. On the other hand, the uncertainty and political backlash could create negative sentiment towards tech companies involved, including Apple. Previous rounds have varied, reflecting the nuanced situation. Some models viewed it as slightly positive, while others saw more balance or even a potential negative impact. Given the complexity and the fact that the ultimate outcome remains uncertain, I lean slightly towards a negative impact due to potential regulatory risks, but acknowledge the offsetting potential benefits. Furthermore, there are different conflicting viewpoints from the round 0 models. Some feel more positive, while others are closer to neutral. Therefore, I will take all of the models' viewpoints into consideration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news surrounding TikTok's temporary ban and subsequent restoration introduces significant uncertainty regarding Apple's stock price. While a prolonged TikTok ban might have boosted Apple's App Store indirectly, its temporary nature negates this potential positive impact. The ongoing political tug-of-war and legal ambiguity make predicting the outcome challenging.  The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.6 for both rising and falling probabilities, showcasing this ambiguity.  While there's no direct negative impact on Apple from the TikTok situation, the volatile nature of the situation and the potential for lasting regulatory uncertainty creates risk. The lack of a clear winner or loser in this scenario, combined with the existing market sentiment toward Apple, makes a neutral stance the most probable. There is also a risk that the ongoing legal battle will negatively impact Apple's reputation, even if they are not directly involved in the legality of TikTok.  This suggests a slight skew towards a potential fall, though the overall impact is likely minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law, with implications for Apple as a key platform provider. The situation is fluid, with political uncertainty and mixed signals from various stakeholders. While the restoration of TikTok service could be seen as positive for Apple's App Store revenue, the ongoing legal and political challenges create uncertainty. Previous model predictions suggest a slightly optimistic view, with probabilities leaning towards a rise in stock price, but balanced by concerns over future regulatory actions. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the overall sentiment from previous predictions, the probabilities are nearly balanced with a slight inclination towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law and President Trump's directive. This situation primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, but also has implications for other tech companies, including Apple. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal as the news does not directly indicate a significant negative or positive effect on Apple's core business. However, Apple's compliance with the law and its role as a gatekeeper for TikTok's availability on the App Store could influence investor sentiment. Given that the situation with TikTok may have been averted for now, and considering Apple's significant role in the app ecosystem, the probabilities of a stock price rise or fall seem relatively balanced. However, there might be a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the avoidance of a potential negative scenario for Apple, similar to previous analyses.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law. The shutdown of TikTok might drive more traffic to other social media platforms available on Apple's App Store, which could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the uncertainty surrounding the future of TikTok and the possibility that Trump's actions might not be legally sustainable creates a volatile situation. Considering the mixed signals and potential benefits for Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers the potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to President Trump's directive. Initially, the ban on TikTok seemed negative as it could reduce user engagement within Apple\u2019s App Store, potentially impacting revenue. However, with the news of the service being restored, it mitigates immediate negative impacts. There is still considerable political and legal uncertainty, which might cause investors to proceed with caution. Given the mixed signals and historical trends of similar announcements, the impact on Apple\u2019s stock price is likely to be modest.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news surrounding TikTok's temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration creates a complex landscape for Apple (AAPL). While the initial ban might have suggested a competitive advantage for Apple, the quick restoration indicates stability for TikTok and uncertainty persists around regulatory implications. Although TikTok's troubles could have drawn users to other social media platforms, the likelihood of a ban being suddenly lifted by political intervention reduces immediate risks for Apple. This dynamic leads to mixed sentiments among analysts, where some predict slight positivity for Apple's stock due to mitigated risks, while others express caution due to ongoing political and legal challenges. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, reflecting mixed but tentatively optimistic sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The situation surrounding TikTok's potential ban and subsequent reprieve in the US introduces a complex interplay of factors affecting Apple (AAPL). A complete ban of TikTok could have benefitted Apple by diverting users to other apps in the App Store, potentially boosting revenue. However, the news indicates a temporary restoration due to President Trump's intervention, mitigating this positive impact. The significant uncertainty surrounding the legal and political dimensions introduces market volatility. Previous analyses display mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a slightly positive impact, while others anticipate a negative one and others suggest neutrality. Given the unpredictable nature of future legislative/executive actions regarding TikTok and the risk of regulatory uncertainty affecting investor sentiment towards Apple, I slightly favor the potential of a fall. I believe the risks involved in the legal limbo slightly overshadow the benefits for Apple. However, it warrants pointing out that the situation remains in flux and thus could easily change.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary ban and subsequent restoration presents a complex scenario for Apple. While a prolonged ban could have benefited Apple indirectly by driving users to other apps on its App Store, the temporary nature of the ban and its uncertain future negate this positive impact.  The conflicting statements from various political figures introduce significant uncertainty.  Trump's intervention might offer short-term stability, but the legal challenges and potential future bans create volatility and risk.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the ambiguity.   The overall impact on Apple is likely to be minimal in the short term, with any price movement more likely driven by broader market forces than this specific news. The potential negative impact on Apple's reputation due to its involvement as a gatekeeper of TikTok on its App Store cannot be ignored. Considering the uncertainty and lack of a clear direction, the probabilities are nearly balanced, leaning slightly toward a neutral outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law, with implications for Apple as a key platform provider. While the shutdown could have driven users to other apps in the App Store, the rapid restoration of TikTok service mitigates any potential positive impact on Apple. The situation is further complicated by political and legal uncertainties, with mixed signals from key figures like President Trump and opposition from some lawmakers. Previous model predictions have ranged from neutral to slightly positive or negative, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple's core business and the potential for minimal disruption to App Store revenues, the probabilities are nearly balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the avoidance of a worst-case scenario.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law. While the situation primarily affects TikTok, it also has implications for Apple as a key platform provider for TikTok. The restoration of TikTok's service mitigates immediate negative impacts on Apple, but ongoing legal and political uncertainties create volatility. Given the mixed signals and potential benefits for Apple, such as increased traffic to other social media platforms on the App Store, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. However, the overall impact is likely to be minimal due to the indirect nature of the effects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.
