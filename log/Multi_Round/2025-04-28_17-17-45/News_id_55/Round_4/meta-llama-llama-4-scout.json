(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a broader concern regarding the financial health and growth potential of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple. While these companies are viewed as safe investments, there are warnings about reduced expected returns due to high spending and interdependencies. This sentiment could lead to cautious investor behavior in the short term, potentially resulting in a price decline for Apple. Thus, the probabilities indicate a greater chance of stock price fall compared to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. While being viewed as 'safe assets' initially seems positive, the core argument is that this perception leads to lower expected returns and excessive spending among the companies themselves, which Desai likens to \"a snake eating its own tail.\" This suggests that current valuations might be unsustainable and future growth could be limited due to over-investment and potentially inefficient resource allocation. The news also mentions a tech sell-off fueled by DeepSeek's AI. While Apple is involved in AI, the broader concerns about the Mag 7's capital allocation and reliance on each other for growth are more likely to create downward pressure, slightly increasing the probability of a stock price fall. Note, this analysis is based on limited information and a single article. Broader market dynamics and company-specific news would be needed for a more accurate assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, and their status as safe assets in uncertain times.  Professor Desai's 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor highlights the internal competition and overspending within Big Tech, leading to potentially low returns. While Apple is considered a safe haven, this inherent risk of low returns, coupled with the general tech sell-off mentioned in the article (triggered by DeepSeek's AI advancements), suggests a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise in the short term.  The news doesn't present any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. The overall sentiment is negative concerning the future performance of the Magnificent Seven due to internal competition and overspending, therefore impacting Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and highlights concerns about their market dominance being likened to a 'snake eating its own tail.' The metaphor suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the broader context implies potential pressure on Big Tech stocks, including AAPL, due to investor concerns about low returns and overvaluation. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams might mitigate some downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high spending on each other and themselves, likened to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This metaphor suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant or declining growth cycle. The comparison of these companies to a safe asset with expected low returns may lead investors to be cautious or reduce their expectations for future growth, potentially resulting in a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, this perception leads to low expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, which can result in low returns. The article does not provide any specific positive or negative news about Apple, but the overall tone suggests that the dominance of these tech companies may not be sustainable. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the concept of the 'Magnificent Seven'Big Tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), being viewed as a safe asset amidst market uncertainty. According to Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai, while this perception leads to increased investment, it also results in low expected returns due to high expenses within these companies. The news suggests a cautious outlook for investors, anticipating potentially suboptimal performance. This information might lead to temporary selling pressures but doesn't fundamentally alter long-term investor sentiments towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) amid concerns regarding the broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies. The metaphor of 'a snake eating its own tail' highlights issues of self-referential spending and reduced expected returns, which could deter investors. While these companies, including Apple, are generally considered safe assets in uncertain times, the underlying implications of lower returns suggest potential downward pressure on stock prices. Previous predictions from other models were largely pessimistic, indicating a higher chance of price declines. Based on this cumulative analysis, I estimate a greater probability of stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment regarding the 'Magnificent Seven' due to concerns about low returns and overspending suggests a continued downward pressure on Apple's stock. The snake eating its own tail metaphor and the underlying logic of unsustainability outweigh the 'safe asset' perception. The previous predictions consistently favor a stock price fall, and there's little indication to deviate. Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, including Apple, and their status as safe-haven assets during uncertain times.  However, the core argument revolves around the unsustainable nature of this dominance due to excessive internal spending and resulting low returns.  Professor Desai's 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor aptly illustrates this self-inflicted limitation on future growth. While Apple is considered a relatively safe bet, this inherent risk of low returns, coupled with the broader tech sell-off mentioned in the news, points towards a higher probability of a price decline in the short-term.  The lack of specific positive news for Apple amplifies the negative sentiment. Considering previous predictions showing a consistent lean towards a stock price fall (averaging around 65% probability), and the lack of any countervailing positive news impacting Apple specifically, my assessment aligns with this trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, being viewed as safe assets but potentially leading to low returns due to excessive spending and interdependencies. The metaphor 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant cycle. While Apple's strong fundamentals might offer some resilience, the broader negative sentiment and the mention of a tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI advancements could lead to cautious investor behavior and downward pressure on the stock price. Considering the mixed outlook but leaning towards the negative implications of low returns and overvaluation, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and their status as safe assets in uncertain times. However, this perception leads to low expected returns and excessive spending by these companies, which can result in low returns. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant or declining growth cycle. Given that the news does not provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price and highlights a broader tech sell-off, it is reasonable to conclude that the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. The consensus from various predictions indicates a cautious outlook, with most models suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high spending on each other and themselves, likened to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This metaphor suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant or declining growth cycle. The comparison of these companies to a safe asset with expected low returns may lead investors to be cautious or reduce their expectations for future growth, potentially resulting in a stock price decline. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, with most models predicting a probability of stock price fall above 0.6. Based on this analysis and the overall negative sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven', I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.32 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.68.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a broader concern regarding the financial health and growth potential of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple. Despite the companies being viewed as safe investments, the core argument is their perceived low expected returns due to excess spending and interdependencies. This sentiment could lead to cautious investor behavior, potentially resulting in a price decline for Apple. Although Apple has strong fundamentals, the overarching theme of low returns and overinvestment across Big Tech creates a bearish market sentiment, influencing the predicted downward trend.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news discusses the Magnificent Seven, including Apple, suggesting that while these companies are seen as safe assets, they also suffer from overspending and low expected returns, likened to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This metaphor indicates potential stagnation and encourages cautious investor behavior, likely resulting in downward pressure on Apple\u2019s stock price. Most previous predictions suggest a consensus of increased likelihood for a stock price fall due to the described economic environment. Therefore, the probabilities lean towards a greater chance of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' and raises concerns about their long-term growth prospects due to overspending and reliance on each other. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor paints a picture of unsustainable practices. While Apple is considered a safe asset, the emphasis on lower expected returns and the general tech sell-off sentiment weigh negatively on its potential stock price movement. Previous predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a price fall. I'm maintaining that bias, slightly increasing the probability of a fall in consideration of the continued bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article expresses concern about the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, being viewed as safe assets, leading to low returns due to excessive spending and interdependencies.  The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor highlights the unsustainable nature of this dominance. While Apple's strong fundamentals might offer some resilience, the overall sentiment is bearish due to concerns about low returns and overvaluation. The consistent negative predictions from multiple models across two rounds further reinforce this sentiment.  The mention of a broader tech sell-off exacerbates the negative pressure.  Considering the weight of evidence, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and their dominance in the market. The metaphor 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets but are experiencing low expected returns due to excessive spending and interdependencies. This sentiment, coupled with a broader tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI advancements, indicates a cautious outlook for Apple's stock. While Apple's strong fundamentals may offer some resilience, the overall negative sentiment and lack of specific positive catalysts suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall. Previous predictions from various models also consistently favored a higher probability of decline, reinforcing this outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), being viewed as safe assets but potentially facing low returns due to excessive spending and interdependencies.

Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The financial news regarding the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies presents a largely negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The metaphor of 'a snake eating its own tail' emphasizes the excessive spending and weakened growth expectations tied to these companies being perceived as safe assets. This leads to concerns about low returns and potential unsustainability in their market dominance. Despite Apple's strong fundamentals, the overall sentiment is bearish, especially considering the broader tech sell-off stemming from developments in the AI sector. Given the analysis of previous predictions, which consistently suggest a higher probability of stock price decline, I estimate a greater likelihood of a decline over an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus across multiple models and rounds of predictions is that the news is bearish for Apple. The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor highlights concerns about the sustainability of the Magnificent Seven's dominance due to excessive spending and low expected returns. The lack of specific positive catalysts for Apple, the broader tech sell-off mentioned in the news article, and consistently pessimistic previous predictions further support the likelihood of a price decline. Although Apple possesses strong fundsmentals, the overbearing sentiment indicates a downward path.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article expresses concern about the 'Magnificent Seven', including Apple, being viewed as safe assets, leading to low returns due to excessive spending and interdependencies.

The consistent negative predictions from multiple models across three rounds reinforce this sentiment. The lack of specific positive news for Apple amplifies this negative outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered significantly higher than a rise, aligning with the established trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and highlights concerns about their dominance being likened to a 'snake eating its own tail.'
