      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: AI Fueling Apple iPhone Sales But Limited Rollout Has Hurt\nNews Content: Apple iPhone sales rose in those markets where the company rolled out artificial intelligence features. The news was positive for Apple stock.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple has seen increased iPhone sales in markets where AI features have been introduced, which is a positive indicator for the company's revenue potential. However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' implies that this growth may not be sustained or widespread, potentially dampening overall investor enthusiasm. Despite this limitation, the overall positive news about rising sales indicates a stronger likelihood of stock price increase over decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive impact from AI features on iPhone sales in specific markets. This suggests that AI is indeed a driver for growth. However, the 'limited rollout' is mentioned as a hindering factor, implying that the positive impact could have been larger. Considering both the positive (AI fueling sales) and negative (limited rollout) aspects, the positive seems to outweigh the negative, but to a degree limited by the rollout speed. Another limiting factor is the statement that 'The news was positive for Apple stock' alone; without specifics, the impact needs to be reasonably constrained because positive news doesn't solely dictate stock movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is positive overall, showing that AI features are boosting iPhone sales in the markets where they've been implemented.  However, the caveat that the rollout has been 'limited' suggests that the positive impact is currently constrained.  This limits the strength of the positive signal.  A limited rollout implies that the full potential of AI's impact on iPhone sales (and thus Apple's stock) remains unrealized.  Therefore, while the news is generally good, the incomplete implementation suggests a moderate, rather than strong, upward pressure on the stock price.  There's a chance that investors may react cautiously given the limited rollout, leading to a smaller price increase than if the rollout had been broader or if the news hadn't mentioned the limitations at all.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where AI features were rolled out, which is positive for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features may have constrained the overall impact. The positive sales growth in certain markets suggests potential upside for the stock, but the limited reach could temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the news is more positive than negative, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's iPhone sales have risen in markets where artificial intelligence features were rolled out. This positive development suggests that the integration of AI features into their products could be a growth driver for the company. However, the news also mentions a 'limited rollout' which might cap the stock's upside potential if investors perceive the progress as slow or insufficient. Overall, the news seems to lean towards being positive as it highlights a successful feature that could drive sales further if expanded. The positive impact on iPhone sales due to AI features likely outweighs the negative perception of a limited rollout for now, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have risen in markets where the company has rolled out artificial intelligence features, which is a positive development for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive effect of the AI-fueled sales increase, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. But since the rollout is limited, the rise might not be as pronounced as it could have been with a wider rollout.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive impact on Apple's iPhone sales due to the introduction of artificial intelligence features. This suggests improved market performance and potentially higher revenue, which typically has a favorable effect on stock prices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
