This suggests that AI is indeed a driver for growth. However, the 'limited rollout' is mentioned as a hindering factor, implying that the positive impact could have been larger. Considering both the positive (AI fueling sales) and negative (limited rollout) aspects, the positive seems to outweigh the negative, but to a degree limited by the rollout speed. Another limiting factor is the statement that 'The news was positive for Apple stock' alone; without specifics, the impact needs to be reasonably constrained because positive news doesn't solely dictate stock movements.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"AI Fueling Apple iPhone Sales But Limited Rollout Has Hurt\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
