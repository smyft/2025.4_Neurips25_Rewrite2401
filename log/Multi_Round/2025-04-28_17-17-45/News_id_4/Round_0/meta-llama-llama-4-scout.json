This positive development suggests that the integration of AI features into their products could be a growth driver for the company. However, the news also mentions a 'limited rollout' which might cap the stock's upside potential if investors perceive the progress as slow or insufficient. Overall, the news seems to lean towards being positive as it highlights a successful feature that could drive sales further if expanded. The positive impact on iPhone sales due to AI features likely outweighs the negative perception of a limited rollout for now, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"AI Fueling Apple iPhone Sales But Limited Rollout Has Hurt\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```"
