The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), alongside strong performance in multiple segments. The overall sentiment is positive with significant growth in services and a strong upgrade cycle for iPhones. However, there are concerns regarding declining revenue in Greater China and challenges in the wearables segment. The impact of foreign exchange headwinds and operating expense increases could temper the positive outlook. Given the record performance metrics and growth in emerging markets, the probabilities lean towards a stock price rise despite the negatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings were strong, with record revenue and EPS. iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services revenue all showed positive growth, contributing to an overall positive financial picture. The installed base is also at a record high, indicating strong customer loyalty. Share repurchases further incentivize investors. However, a notable decline in Greater China revenue and a decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue present challenges. Foreign exchange headwinds are also expected. The success of Apple Intelligence is a significant positive, but its unavailability in China is a concern. Furthermore, GuruFocus detected 3 warning signs which could indicate deeper underlying issues not captured in this single report. Considering both the positive and negative aspects, the positive earnings generally outweigh the negatives in the immediate term, leading to an estimation that there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise than fall. However, a 100% rise is extremely unlikely, and the negative factors contribute to a moderate likelihood of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  The positive aspects significantly outweigh the negatives. While concerns exist regarding China's market performance and increased operating expenses, the strong overall results, particularly record iPhone sales and growth in services and emerging markets, point towards a positive outlook. The introduction of Apple Intelligence is showing promising results in boosting demand where it's available. Although the China market weakness and currency headwinds are notable negative factors, the overall strength of the report suggests these are manageable challenges. The high installed base provides a strong foundation for continued growth.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc's record revenue and EPS, with significant growth in several product categories and regions, particularly in emerging markets like India. The strong performance in iPhone sales, services revenue, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence features are positive indicators. However, challenges in Greater China due to competitive pressures and the absence of Apple Intelligence, along with declines in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, pose risks. The overall positive financial performance and growth in key areas suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, despite some negative factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase year over year, with record EPS of $2.40, up 10% year over year. The company's performance was driven by strong iPhone sales, record Services revenue, and growth in emerging markets. However, challenges in Greater China, a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds were noted. Despite these mixed signals, the overall positive financial results and the company's optimistic outlook on innovation and growth in emerging markets are likely to have a more significant impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The company reported record revenue and EPS, with strong growth in multiple regions and product categories, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services. However, there were some negative points, such as a decline in Greater China revenue and a decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue. Despite these challenges, the company's overall performance and guidance suggest a positive outlook. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales. Additionally, the company's installed base of active devices reached a new record, and emerging markets offer significant upside potential. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report highlighted record revenue and earnings per share, with significant growth across multiple product categories, particularly in services and emerging markets. Despite the positive outlook, there are concerns regarding declining revenue in Greater China, a decrease in wearables revenue, and foreign exchange headwinds. However, the overall strong financial performance and record customer loyalty suggest a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Taking into account the positive aspects outweighing the negatives, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The general consensus from previous rounds indicates a bullish sentiment for Apple (AAPL) due to record revenue and EPS, growth in services and emerging markets, and positive reception of Apple Intelligence where it's available. However, concerns remain regarding the decline in Greater China revenue, challenges in the wearables segment, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses which were consistently highlighted across rounds. The GuruFocus warning signs also suggest some deeper concerns. Taking into consideration the previous predictions, the consistent positive momentum, and the warnings, I will assign probability slightly lower than previous round given the warning info to incorporate a more cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report reveals a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are undeniably positive, driven by strong iPhone sales, growth in services, and expansion in emerging markets.  The record installed base also bodes well for future growth.  However, significant headwinds exist.  The decline in Greater China revenue (a major market) is concerning, especially given the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there and increased competition.  Decreased Wearables revenue and rising operating expenses also present challenges. The GuruFocus warning signs further add to the caution. While the overall financial performance is impressive, the negative factors are substantial enough to temper the immediate positive reaction. Considering previous model predictions which mostly favored a price rise (averaging around 0.72 probability of rise),  I'm adjusting slightly downward to account for the substantial negative aspects, particularly the China market performance and GuruFocus warnings. This suggests a higher probability of a rise, but not as pronounced as the initial, overly optimistic assessments suggested.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 2025 earnings report reveals a strong financial performance with record revenue and EPS, driven by significant growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services revenues, particularly in emerging markets like India.

The previous round of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of stock price rise, reflecting confidence in the company's strong fundamentals outweighing the noted challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported record revenue and EPS for Q1  of 2025, with significant growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services revenue. The company's installed base of active devices reached a new record, and customer satisfaction remains high. Despite challenges in Greater China and a decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall financial performance and growth in emerging markets suggest a positive outlook. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has contributed to stronger iPhone sales, and the company's guidance implies continued advancements and innovation. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, although potential challenges and headwinds exist.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's record revenue and EPS, driven by strong performances in iPhone sales, services revenue, and growth in emerging markets.

Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably. The consistency in the previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of stock price rising, also supports this assessment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. reported strong Q1 2025 earnings with record revenue and earnings per share, driven by solid growth across various segments, particularly iPhone and services. The installed base of devices also reached a historic high, indicating strong customer loyalty. However, there were notable challenges, including an 11% decline in revenue from Greater China and a decrease in wearables revenue, alongside expected foreign exchange headwinds that may impact future results. The positive financial performance suggests a favorable outlook, but the warning signs detected may indicate underlying concerns. Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher estimate for stock price rise probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings demonstrate robust performance with record revenue and EPS, driven by growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, particularly excelling in emerging markets. The positive reception of Apple Intelligence bolsters iPhone demand. However, challenges persist, including declining Greater China revenue, decreasing Wearables revenue, potential foreign exchange headwinds, and the GuruFocus warning signs. Considering the consensus from previous predictions and the nuanced mix of positive and negative factors, I'm weighting the positives slightly less due to the highlighted risks.

The GuruFocus warning signs have been consistently flagged which introduces some potential issues related to financial health. Taking into consideration the previous predictions and the mix of positive and negative factors along with the warning signs, I'm weighing the positives less due to these risks. Also, the majority of the weakness in China seems to be driven by inventory issues so can expect some recovery in upcoming quarters.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.

Decreased Wearables revenue, rising operating expenses, and the three GuruFocus warning signs add considerable caution.

The previous model predictions show a consistent but slightly decreasing trend toward a price rise, which reflects this cautious optimism. I've considered the consistent positive performance that outweighs the negatives, but also accounted for the uncertainty introduced by the China market weakness, increased operating expenses and the GuruFocus warnings.
