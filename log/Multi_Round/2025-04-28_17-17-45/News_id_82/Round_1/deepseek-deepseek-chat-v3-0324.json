(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses a projected 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025, which is a positive outlook. Despite the expected deceleration in growth and current valuation concerns, historical trends indicate that new product entries tend to boost demand, benefiting companies like Apple. Therefore, the overall sentiment is optimistic, leaning toward a rise in stock prices. However, the uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact on the market adds a degree of caution, balancing the outlook. This leads to a higher probability of a stock price rise but still acknowledges a risk for a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader tech sector (XLK), not specifically Apple. While it predicts a 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, this is a future projection and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of DeepSeek's impact creating uncertainty and the general erosion of PE ratios in the tech sector introduces some downside risk.  Since the news is broadly positive for the tech sector but doesn't directly impact Apple, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but  the impact is likely to be muted compared to news directly concerning Apple's performance or product announcements.  The probability estimates reflect this moderate positive sentiment with a significant portion reflecting uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for the tech sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the Senior Portfolio Manager projects 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, which could justify current valuations and boost investor confidence. Additionally, historical trends suggest that new product entries (like DeepSeek's AI model) may increase overall demand, benefiting major tech players like Apple. However, concerns about valuation erosion due to slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts introduce uncertainty. The Nasdaq's rebound (+2%) after the initial sell-off indicates some market optimism. Overall, the positive earnings projection and historical benefits from innovation slightly outweigh the valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. The portfolio manager, Margie Patel, remains optimistic about the tech sector's growth, stating that current valuations can be justified by the expected earnings growth. Historically, new product entries tend to create increased demand, benefiting major tech companies like Apple. Although there are concerns about the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and valuation concerns due to slowing growth, the overall sentiment from the news is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the technology sector, including Big Tech companies like Apple, is expected to experience 20% earnings growth in 2025 according to a portfolio manager. This projection is despite initial concerns about the impact of new AI models on the sector. Historically, new product entries have created increased demand, benefiting the entire tech market. Additionally, the portfolio manager notes that the current valuations can be justified with the projected earnings growth. However, there are also mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns. Considering these points, the overall sentiment seems positive, indicating a potential rise in stock prices.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
