(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses a projected 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025, which is a positive outlook. Despite the expected deceleration in growth and current valuation concerns, historical trends indicate that new product entries tend to boost demand, benefiting companies like Apple. Therefore, the overall sentiment is optimistic, leaning toward a rise in stock prices. However, the uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact on the market adds a degree of caution, balancing the outlook. This leads to a higher probability of a stock price rise but still acknowledges a risk for a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is positive, suggesting a potential 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025. However, this is based on the opinion of one portfolio manager and comes with caveats. The article mentions prior expectations of deceleration in growth, uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's impact, and concerns about valuation erosion. While historically new product demand has created benefits, the article focuses on big tech companies broadly, making the singular impact on Apple Inc. more uncertain. The mention of PE erosion and capex issues could raise investor concern, slightly diminishing the probable effect of the positive projection mentioned in the headline. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term projection offset by near-term uncertainty and pre-existing concerns\u2014I'll assign a slightly more positive than neutral probability to a stock price increase but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader tech sector (XLK), not specifically Apple. While it predicts a 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, this is a future projection and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of DeepSeek's impact creating uncertainty and the general erosion of PE ratios in the tech sector introduces some downside risk.  Since the news is broadly positive for the tech sector but doesn't directly impact Apple, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but  the impact is likely to be muted compared to news directly concerning Apple's performance or product announcements.  The probability estimates reflect this moderate positive sentiment with a significant portion reflecting uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for the tech sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the Senior Portfolio Manager projects 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, which could justify current valuations and boost investor confidence. Additionally, historical trends suggest that new product entries (like DeepSeek's AI model) may increase overall demand, benefiting major tech players like Apple. However, concerns about valuation erosion due to slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts introduce uncertainty. The Nasdaq's rebound (+2%) after the initial sell-off indicates some market optimism. Overall, the positive earnings projection and historical benefits from innovation slightly outweigh the valuation concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. The portfolio manager, Margie Patel, remains optimistic about the tech sector's growth, stating that current valuations can be justified by the expected earnings growth. Historically, new product entries tend to create increased demand, benefiting major tech companies like Apple. Although there are concerns about the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and valuation concerns due to slowing growth, the overall sentiment from the news is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article mentions that the technology sector, including Big Tech companies like Apple, is expected to experience 20% earnings growth in 2025 according to a portfolio manager. This projection is despite initial concerns about the impact of new AI models on the sector. Historically, new product entries have created increased demand, benefiting the entire tech market. Additionally, the portfolio manager notes that the current valuations can be justified with the projected earnings growth. However, there are also mentions of uncertainties and erosion of price-earnings ratios due to slowing growth concerns. Considering these points, the overall sentiment seems positive, indicating a potential rise in stock prices.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Despite current uncertainties surrounding the AI sector and its potential impacts, the Senior Portfolio Manager remains optimistic, suggesting that the sector's valuations could justify current stock prices. This positive sentiment should support a bullish tone for Apple's stock. However, short-term fluctuations due to market concerns around technology growth and capital expenditures need to be considered.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed yet predominantly positive outlook for Apple Inc. within the broader technology sector. With a projected 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, the sentiment suggests potential for stock price appreciation. Historical trends indicate that new product introductions tend to spur demand, which benefits major players like Apple. However, there are notable reservations concerning the impact of DeepSeek's technology and the ongoing erosion of valuation metrics, which balances the optimism. Overall, after considering previous predictions and the prevailing uncertainties, I estimate a higher probability for a stock price increase compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price due to the projected 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025. This is tempered by uncertainties related to DeepSeek's impact and some valuation concerns. However, the historical precedent of new product entries boosting demand and the portfolio manager's optimism support a price increase. Given the generally positive sentiment across past analyses and their predictions along with the specific points highlighted in the news, the probability of a stock price increase continues to be higher than a decrease, but I will lean slightly more conservative given the conflicting information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is broadly positive for the tech sector, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.  However, this is a long-term projection and doesn't guarantee immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The news also highlights uncertainties related to DeepSeek's impact and valuation concerns within the tech sector. While the positive outlook is encouraging, the lack of Apple-specific information and the existing concerns dilute the positive impact.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.55 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the inherent uncertainty surrounding the news, a conservative estimate is warranted. The overall sentiment leans slightly positive but with significant uncertainty, suggesting a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a Senior Portfolio Manager projecting a 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, which includes Apple. This projection, despite concerns about valuation erosion and the impact of DeepSeek's AI model, leans towards optimism. Historical trends suggest that new product entries tend to increase overall demand, benefiting major players like Apple. Additionally, the Nasdaq's rebound indicates some market optimism. However, uncertainties and valuation concerns slightly temper the positive outlook. Given the overall positive sentiment and historical benefits from innovation, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a projected 20% earnings growth in 2025. Despite concerns about the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and valuation erosion due to slowing growth, the overall sentiment from the news is positive. Historically, new product entries tend to create increased demand, benefiting major tech companies like Apple. The portfolio manager's optimism and the projected earnings growth justify current valuations, indicating a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. However, uncertainties and concerns about slowing growth and capital expenditures introduce some caution. Considering these points, the estimated probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling, but with a moderate bias towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses a projected 20% earnings growth for the tech sector in 2025, which is a positive outlook for Big Tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL).

The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a positive outlook, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a stock price rise. Taking into account the mixed signals and the general optimism in the tech sector, a moderate to high probability of a stock price rise is estimated.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive outlook on tech earnings in 2025, with a projected 20% growth for Big Tech companies, including Apple. The projections made by a senior portfolio manager remain optimistic, emphasizing that current valuations can be justified by expected earnings growth. Historical trends suggest that new product entries create increased demand, which benefits major tech companies like Apple. However, concerns about DeepSeek's impact and valuation erosion due to slowing growth and capital expenditure issues add some uncertainty. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment leans positive with historical benefits from innovation supporting this view.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news indicates a projection of 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, which is generally positive for Apple Inc. Historical trends suggest that new product developments can stimulate demand, benefitting major tech firms like Apple. However, there are concerns regarding valuation erosion and uncertainty from DeepSeek's new AI model, which introduces caution. Despite these mixed signals, the overall sentiment from the news remains optimistic. Considering previous predictions and market reactions, I estimate a moderately high probability for the stock price to rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news focuses on a positive earnings growth projection for the tech sector, which includes Apple. While there are uncertainties regarding DeepSeek and valuation concerns, the overall sentiment leans bullish. Previous rounds of predictions also reflect this, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a stock price rise. Considering the consistent positive trend, I am slightly increasing the probability of a price rise, but remaining cautious due to aforementioned uncertainties. The 20% earning growth projection is the prominant positive factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is positive for the tech sector as a whole, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.  However, this is a long-term projection and doesn't guarantee immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The news also highlights uncertainties related to DeepSeek's impact and valuation concerns within the sector. While the positive outlook is encouraging, the lack of Apple-specific information and the existing concerns significantly dilute the positive impact.  The previous predictions show a range from 0.55 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the consensus leaning slightly positive but with considerable uncertainty, I'm assigning a probability slightly higher than neutral for a price rise.  The relatively high uncertainty means that while a rise is more likely, a price fall remains a significant possibility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) within the broader tech sector, with a projected 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025.

Previous predictions have consistently shown a moderate to high probability of a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the potential risks, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling, though some caution is warranted due to prevailing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on a projected 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, a positive signal for Apple. This is tempered by uncertainties around DeepSeek, valuation concerns, and the fact that the news addresses the tech sector generally, not Apple specifically. However, the consistent positive sentiment from previous rounds, with many models increasing their probability of a rise, suggests the market is interpreting this as beneficial for Apple. Due to the upward trend in positive predictions and the core positive message, I am predicting a rise with increased confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is positive for the tech sector as a whole, projecting 20% earnings growth in 2025.

The uncertainty means that while a rise is more likely, a price fall remains a significant possibility.  The trend in previous predictions shows a slight upward movement, reflecting continued consideration of the positive news, but not enough to shift the overall likelihood of a price rise drastically.  Considering these factors, and the lack of any significant negative information directly related to Apple,  a slightly higher probability of a price rise is maintained.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed yet predominantly positive outlook for Apple Inc.
