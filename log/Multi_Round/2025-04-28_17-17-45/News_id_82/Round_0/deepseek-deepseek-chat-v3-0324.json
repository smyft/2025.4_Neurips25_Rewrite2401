(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\nNews Content: The technology sector (XLK) is rebounding from losses earlier this week after the latest AI model from Chinese-owned DeepSeek sent chip stocks plunging. Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

On the positive side, the Senior Portfolio Manager projects 20% earnings growth for Big Tech in 2025, which could justify current valuations and boost investor confidence. Additionally, historical trends suggest that new product entries (like DeepSeek's AI model) may increase overall demand, benefiting major tech players like Apple. However, concerns about valuation erosion due to slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts introduce uncertainty. The Nasdaq's rebound (+2%) after the initial sell-off indicates some market optimism. Overall, the positive earnings projection and historical benefits from innovation slightly outweigh the valuation concerns.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech set for 20% earnings growth in 2025, portfolio mgr. says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
