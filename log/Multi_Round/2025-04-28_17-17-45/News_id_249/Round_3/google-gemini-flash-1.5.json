(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\nNews Content: \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, noting its strong customer base and increasing revenue from services. Furthermore, Buffett emphasizes a fundamental principle of investing in quality companies with sustained growth potential. Given Apple\u2019s success with its devices and services, this news is likely to positively influence investor sentiment, potentially leading to an increase in stock price. However, there is a consideration of the stock's high valuation, which may temper price rises. Overall, the positive sentiment outweighs the negative aspects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple (AAPL) as a long-term investment based on Warren Buffett's investment philosophy and Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in the company. The article highlights Apple's strong brand loyalty, growing customer base, expansion in the services sector, revenue growth, and potential AI integration. The article mentions Buffett calling Apple \"better than any business Berkshire owns\". The positive sentiment around long-term value and growth, combined with Buffett's endorsement, is likely to create upward pressure on the stock price. The mention of potential \"Double Down\" opportunities also adds a small amount of positive support. However, it is crucial to note the article is from MotleyFool and could skew toward more positive sentiment in order to drive up demand and revenue.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's continued confidence in Apple as a long-term investment, citing its strong performance, growing customer base, expansion into high-margin services, and substantial profits.  While the article mentions the stock being 'expensive', it also suggests dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate risk.  The positive portrayal of Apple's fundamentals and future prospects outweighs the mention of the stock's high valuation.  The past performance cited, while impressive, is not directly predictive of future performance and shouldn't be the sole basis for prediction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, though not guaranteed. The mention of 'Double Down' alerts is an advertisement and isn't factored into the prediction as its reliability is unknown. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong fundamentals, including a growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and significant growth in high-margin services revenue.

It mentions Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and expanding services business with high profit margins. The article also notes Apple's record revenue, driven by a 13% increase in services revenue, and its massive net profit of $93 billion. Given this positive information and the endorsement from Warren Buffett, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's positive stance on Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals, increasing user base, and expanding services.

Previous predictions in round 0 consistently rated the probability of a stock price rise between 0.65 and 0.8, indicating a strong positive sentiment towards Apple based on the news. I am weighing on the fact that most predictions are similar.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news article is overwhelmingly positive regarding Apple's prospects, citing Warren Buffett's continued strong endorsement and highlighting several key strengths: a large and loyal customer base, growth in high-margin services, substantial profits, and the potential for further growth via AI integration.

However, it's important to note that even positive news doesn't guarantee a stock price rise.  External factors and market sentiment can influence the price regardless of the company's fundamentals.
