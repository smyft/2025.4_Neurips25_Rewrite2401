This is positive news as it showcases Apple's ability to drive revenue from sources beyond its traditional tech focus.  While the specific nature of the investment isn't detailed, its positive impact on EPS strongly suggests a positive market reception. However, it's important to note that the market's reaction might be muted if investors were primarily anticipating AI-related announcements.  There's also the inherent uncertainty related to any stock price movement, making a definitive prediction impossible.
