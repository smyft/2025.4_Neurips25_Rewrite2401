      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared on the back of this non-tech-based investment.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant investment by Apple ($725 billion) that has led to a surge in earnings per share, which is a positive indicator for investors. The mention that this growth is independent of AI suggests a diversified strategy that could appeal to a broader market. Given the strong financial performance implied by the soaring EPS, it is likely to bolster investor confidence and increase the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price increasing is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple, despite not being directly related to AI which is currently a hot investment topic. The statement that \"Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared on the back of this non-tech-based investment\" is a strong indication that this investment is paying off and contributing to Apple's financial health. Increased EPS is generally viewed positively by investors and could drive up demand for the stock. While the specific details of the investment are not provided, the reported EPS growth provides a positive signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline highlights a significant, non-AI-related investment by Apple that has driven EPS growth.  This is positive news as it showcases Apple's ability to drive revenue from sources beyond its traditional tech focus.  While the specific nature of the investment isn't detailed, its positive impact on EPS strongly suggests a positive market reception. However, it's important to note that the market's reaction might be muted if investors were primarily anticipating AI-related announcements.  There's also the inherent uncertainty related to any stock price movement, making a definitive prediction impossible.  Therefore, a high probability of a price rise is assigned, but not a certainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is attributed to non-tech-based growth, leading to a soaring EPS. Investors typically react positively to such substantial investments and improved earnings, as they indicate strong financial health and future growth potential. Given the positive nature of the news and its direct impact on Apple's financial metrics, the likelihood of a stock price rise is high. There is little in the news to suggest negative implications, hence a lower probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's $725 billion investment is fueling its growth, and this investment is not related to artificial intelligence. The fact that Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared as a result of this investment indicates a positive impact on the company's financial performance. This positive news is likely to have a favorable effect on investor sentiment, leading to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a significant increase in Apple's EPS due to non-tech based investments, which has fueled growth for the company. This positive development is likely to positively impact investor sentiment and could lead to an increase in the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

A $725 billion investment resulting in soaring EPS is a significant indicator of strong financial health and future growth potential.  The fact that this growth is unrelated to AI, a currently volatile sector, suggests a more stable and diversified revenue stream.  The consensus among the previous models is also strongly in favor of a price rise. While there's always inherent market volatility and unanticipated factors, the information provided points strongly towards a higher probability of a stock price increase.
