      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared on the back of this non-tech-based investment.\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant investment by Apple ($725 billion) that has led to a surge in earnings per share, which is a positive indicator for investors. The mention that this growth is independent of AI suggests a diversified strategy that could appeal to a broader market. Given the strong financial performance implied by the soaring EPS, it is likely to bolster investor confidence and increase the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price increasing is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple, despite not being directly related to AI which is currently a hot investment topic. The statement that \"Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared on the back of this non-tech-based investment\" is a strong indication that this investment is paying off and contributing to Apple's financial health. Increased EPS is generally viewed positively by investors and could drive up demand for the stock. While the specific details of the investment are not provided, the reported EPS growth provides a positive signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline highlights a significant, non-AI-related investment by Apple that has driven EPS growth.  This is positive news as it showcases Apple's ability to drive revenue from sources beyond its traditional tech focus.  While the specific nature of the investment isn't detailed, its positive impact on EPS strongly suggests a positive market reception. However, it's important to note that the market's reaction might be muted if investors were primarily anticipating AI-related announcements.  There's also the inherent uncertainty related to any stock price movement, making a definitive prediction impossible.  Therefore, a high probability of a price rise is assigned, but not a certainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is attributed to non-tech-based growth, leading to a soaring EPS. Investors typically react positively to such substantial investments and improved earnings, as they indicate strong financial health and future growth potential. Given the positive nature of the news and its direct impact on Apple's financial metrics, the likelihood of a stock price rise is high. There is little in the news to suggest negative implications, hence a lower probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's $725 billion investment is fueling its growth, and this investment is not related to artificial intelligence. The fact that Apple's earnings per share (EPS) has soared as a result of this investment indicates a positive impact on the company's financial performance. This positive news is likely to have a favorable effect on investor sentiment, leading to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a significant increase in Apple's EPS due to non-tech based investments, which has fueled growth for the company. This positive development is likely to positively impact investor sentiment and could lead to an increase in the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news about Apple's $725 billion investment showcases substantial growth that is not reliant on the currently popular AI narrative. The significant increase in earnings per share (EPS) indicates strong financial performance, which is attractive to investors. Multiple analyses from other models consistently predict a higher probability of stock price rise, citing the positive implications of the investment for Apple's growth and profitability. The lack of any negative aspects in the news further supports the expectation of rising stock prices, leading to a consensus around a high likelihood of price appreciation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds is overwhelmingly positive, with models consistently predicting a high probability of the stock price rising. This is primarily due to the positive news regarding Apple's $725 billion investment leading to a surge in EPS, which is typically a strong indicator for investors. Given this strong consensus and the positive nature of the news (especially the focus on EPS growth), I will adjust my prediction to slightly emphasize the probability of a stock price increase. However, there is a small possibility that the market has already priced in this information, which would prevent a significant price swing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive.  A $725 billion investment resulting in soaring EPS is a significant indicator of strong financial health and future growth potential.  The fact that this growth is unrelated to AI, a currently volatile sector, suggests a more stable and diversified revenue stream.  The consensus among the previous models is also strongly in favor of a price rise. While there's always inherent market volatility and unanticipated factors, the information provided points strongly towards a higher probability of a stock price increase.  I've adjusted the probability slightly lower than the highest prediction to account for the inherent uncertainties in stock market prediction and the possibility of market overreaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion non-AI investment leading to a surge in earnings per share (EPS), which is a strong positive indicator for the company's financial health. The diversified growth strategy, independent of the current AI hype, could appeal to a broader market and bolster investor confidence. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently indicate a high probability (0.75-0.85) of the stock price rising, with minimal downside risk (0.15-0.25). The consensus suggests that the market will react favorably to this news, given the direct impact on Apple's financial metrics and the lack of negative implications in the report. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is assessed to be high, while the probability of a fall remains low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment that has led to a surge in earnings per share (EPS), which is a positive indicator for investors. The fact that this growth is independent of AI suggests a diversified strategy that could appeal to a broader market. The overwhelmingly positive sentiment from various models, with predictions of the stock price rising ranging from 0.75 to 0.85, indicates a strong belief in the stock's upward movement. Given the positive impact on EPS and the diversified growth strategy, it is reasonable to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.82, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.18, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a positive outlook for Apple, with a significant $725 billion investment leading to a surge in earnings per share (EPS). This non-tech-based investment suggests a diversified strategy, which could appeal to a broader market. The strong financial performance implied by the soaring EPS is likely to bolster investor confidence and increase the stock price. Analyzing the previous predictions from various models, there is a consistent trend of assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising than falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.75 to 0.85 for a rise and 0.15 to 0.25 for a fall. Considering this trend and the positive news, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a significant increase in Apple's EPS due to non-tech based investments, which has fueled growth for the company. The general trend among previous predictions indicates a strong belief in a potential stock price rise, as all models except one show a higher probability of the stock price rising. While it's noted that some investors might expect AI-related news, the strong growth in earnings is likely to positively impact investor sentiment. The consistency across multiple predictions supports a high probability of the stock price increasing.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
