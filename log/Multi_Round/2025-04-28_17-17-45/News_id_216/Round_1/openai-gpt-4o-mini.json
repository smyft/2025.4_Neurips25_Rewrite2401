(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why AAPL Stock Is Retreating Today\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) stock is sinking 4% after a research firm reported yesterday that sales of the company's iPhones in China had plunged last quarter. Meanwhile, two banks have downgraded the iPhone maker's shares recently.\n\nApple May Be Facing Major Problems in China\n\nThe number of iPhones handed over in China dove 18% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. As a consequence, China-based Huawei Technologies Co. took over the top spot in the Asian country from AAPL, and the American firm's market share has fallen to about one-sixth. Additionally, AAPL is now number three when it comes to smartphone sales in China.Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nTwo Banks Cut Their Ratings on AAPL\n\nInvestment bank Jefferies downgraded the firm to Underperform. The investment bank believes that AAPL has sold fewer iPhones than expected. Moreover, a survey found that American consumers do not believe that the company's AI is \"useful,\" Jefferies reported. As a result, the technology probably won't trigger a supercycle, the investment bank predicted, adding that the company's results for its March quarter may make the Street unhappy.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded AAPL to Hold. It predicts that the demand for Apple's iPhones will drop significantly during the current quarter before sinking much further over the subsequent six months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The company has also faced downgrades from two banks, indicating a lack of confidence in its future sales and demand. The downgrade to 'Underperform' and 'Hold' suggests a bearish outlook from analysts. Furthermore, the mention of competition from Huawei and consumer skepticism regarding Apple's AI innovations contribute to a negative sentiment around the stock. Collectively, these factors suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple (AAPL). A major sales decline in China (18% drop in iPhone sales) coupled with a loss of market leadership to Huawei are significant headwinds. Two bank downgrades, citing weak iPhone demand and concerns about Apple's AI offerings not triggering a 'supercycle,' further reinforce the negative outlook and suggests that future earnings reports may disappoint. The article even suggests investing in other AI stocks, further harming investor confidence in AAPL. The existing 4% drop indicates market validation of the concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  A significant drop in iPhone sales in China (18%), a loss of market share leading to a drop to the number three spot, and downgrades from two investment banks (Jefferies to Underperform and Loop Capital to Hold) paint a picture of weakening demand and potential future underperformance. The concern over the lack of consumer enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives further dampens the outlook. While Apple has a strong brand and diverse product portfolio, the immediate impact of these negative factors suggests a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.  The  probability estimates are subjective and based on the information provided; other unforeseen factors can influence the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a 18% decline in iPhone sales in China, loss of market share to Huawei, and downgrades by two prominent banks (Jefferies and Loop Capital). These downgrades were based on weaker-than-expected iPhone sales, lack of consumer confidence in Apple's AI capabilities, and anticipated further demand decline. Given these factors, the short-term sentiment around AAPL is likely bearish, increasing the probability of a stock price fall. While Apple has long-term potential, the immediate impact of this news is negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, with a drop of 18% in Q4 compared to the same period last year. This led to Huawei Technologies Co. surpassing Apple in market share. Additionally, two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, downgraded Apple's shares due to weak iPhone sales and concerns over the company's AI capabilities. These downgrades and the sales decline are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in iPhone sales in China, with an 18% drop in Q4, and two banks downgrading Apple's shares. This suggests a negative impact on the company's revenue and market share. Additionally, the downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales and lack of useful AI features, further contribute to the bearish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be low, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including a decline in iPhone sales in China, a decrease in market share, and recent downgrade by multiple investment banks. Such negative indicators typically lead to investor pessimism, causing a probable decline in stock price. The news emphasizes the dip in sales and market share, as well as the impact of lowered analyst ratings, which collectively suggest bearish sentiments among investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
