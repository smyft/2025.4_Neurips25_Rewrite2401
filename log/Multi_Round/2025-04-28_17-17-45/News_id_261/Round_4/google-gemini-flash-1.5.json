(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok ban: Where will the app's revenue and 170M users go?\nNews Content: The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban presents both risks and opportunities for Apple Inc. Although the immediate impact indicates that TikTok may be removed from the App Store, which could lead to user displacement, it also suggests a redirection of revenue to competing platforms such as Instagram and YouTube. Historically, shifts in market share can affect Apple's advertising revenue, which could lead to negative sentiment in the market and affect its stock price. However, since Apple is not directly involved with TikTok's revenue and the company maintains a strong product lineup and loyal customer base, the overall likelihood of a significant drop in stock price may be moderated. As such, the probabilities indicate a slight tilt towards a decline but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential public relations challenges from removing TikTok from the App Store, as users may be inconvenienced. This could negatively impact Apple's image and potentially discourage some users from remaining in Apple's ecosystem. On the other hand, while it does not directly benefit from advertising revenue in the way Google or Meta would, Apple provides the platform from which other app companies get their downloads. The ban itself does therefore benefit other businesses that are in the Apple ecosystem. Because app downloads benefit Apple's ecosystem, the change in user adoption would be slightly positive. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the ban and the potential negative impact on Apple's relationship with some users and authorities, I expect a net neutral to slightly negative impact on sentiment for Apple. Because the impact is not directly benefiting nor dramatically impacting Apples bottom line, the movement is not expected to be significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on Apple. While the direct impact on Apple's revenue from the App Store is unclear, the expert mentions Apple will likely remove TikTok from its app store.  This removal could lead to a short-term negative effect as Apple loses a source of App Store revenue. However, the article suggests that advertising revenue lost by TikTok will largely flow to Google and Facebook (META), not Apple.  The uncertainty around the situation and the potential for legal challenges make a definitive prediction difficult.  The short-term effect is likely to be negative, but the long-term impact on Apple is minimal because Apple's business model isn't solely reliant on TikTok's presence on the App Store, and it stands to benefit little from its removal.  Therefore, the probability of a price drop is slightly higher than a price increase, but both are still relatively low considering the larger context of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US, which could redirect users and advertisers to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. While this could benefit companies like Meta (Instagram) and Alphabet (YouTube), Apple's role is more indirect as it relates to removing TikTok from the App Store. The impact on Apple's stock price is less clear, as the primary beneficiaries would be competing social media platforms. However, there is a slight negative sentiment due to the uncertainty and potential legal risks for Apple in removing TikTok from the App Store.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications for advertisers and users may have a mixed impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it could lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple. On the other hand, the ban could drive users to other social media platforms, potentially increasing traffic and engagement for companies like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat, which could indirectly benefit Apple if it hosts these platforms. However, the direct impact on Apple seems limited as TikTok's removal would not significantly alter Apple's core business. Given the uncertainty and potential limited direct impact, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to investor caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its impact on other tech companies. The analyst suggests that companies like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat may gain traffic and revenue if TikTok is banned. However, for Apple Inc. (AAPL), the removal of TikTok from its app store may not have a significant direct impact on its stock price. The article does mention that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from their app stores, but this is not seen as a major negative for Apple. In fact, Apple's ecosystem is diverse, and the loss of TikTok may not significantly affect its overall revenue. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline. This situation may lead to increased traffic on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and potentially others like Reddit and Pinterest. Given the uncertainty around TikTok's high revenue redirection, the market dynamics might shift in favor of these existing competitors, potentially impacting the advertising market. Apple (AAPL) might experience a temporary increase in downloads on alternative applications, particularly if TikTok is removed from the App Store. However, long-term impacts are uncertain. Overall, the news presents both positive (increased app store traffic) and negative (advertising shifts to competitors) factors, but the overall impact seems more negative due to increased competition.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban highlights a direct risk for Apple as it may lead to TikTok's removal from the App Store, which can have a short-term negative impact on user sentiment and potentially affect app downloads. While some analysts suggest that the revenue lost by TikTok could benefit other platforms like Instagram and YouTube, the direct impact on Apple's revenue remains minimal since it operates on a diverse ecosystem. Given the mixed nature of the implications and the uncertainty surrounding the legal situation, the probabilities of stock price movement lean slightly towards falling as investors generally exhibit caution in the face of regulatory challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple and some negative PR, it also presents an opportunity for increased traffic on other platforms within the Apple ecosystem. Considering that the other models have a slight negative bias towards AAPL's price, and considering that it has passed a round and it may be mean-reverting, I'll predict a slightly higher chance of price increase here. Especially after considering that the direct benefit to Apple is limited as TikTok's removal would not significantly alter Apple's core business, and that Trump could use TikTok as leverage in the US-China negotiations, I'll predict a higher chance of an increase in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to a short-term dip in App Store revenue and potential negative PR, the impact is likely to be minimal.  Apple's business model is significantly diversified and doesn't heavily rely on any single app for revenue generation. The redirection of TikTok's user base and advertising revenue largely benefits Meta and Alphabet more directly than Apple.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a slight decrease in stock price, primarily driven by uncertainty and potential negative sentiment surrounding the removal. However, the magnitude of this impact is likely to be small given Apple's overall financial health and diverse revenue streams. Considering the range of predictions, and the fact that Apple's direct exposure to TikTok's revenue is limited, the impact on the stock price is likely to be muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple may face legal and public relations challenges from removing TikTok from the App Store, which could inconvenience users and potentially harm Apple's ecosystem reputation. Additionally, the direct loss of TikTok's App Store revenue is a minor negative. On the positive side, the ban could drive users to other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat, which are part of Apple's ecosystem, potentially increasing App Store traffic and engagement. However, the primary beneficiaries of redirected advertising revenue are likely to be Meta and Alphabet, not Apple. Given the uncertainty and the limited direct impact on Apple's core business, the overall sentiment is slightly negative but not significantly so. The previous predictions also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative impact, with probabilities averaging around 0.35 for a rise and 0.55 for a fall. Considering this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to cautious investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US presents both risks and opportunities for Apple Inc. The ban could lead to the removal of TikTok from the App Store, which might result in a short-term negative impact on Apple's revenue. However, the primary beneficiaries of TikTok's user base and advertising revenue would likely be other social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat, rather than Apple directly. Given the uncertainty and potential limited direct impact on Apple's core business, the stock price movement probabilities are estimated to slightly favor a decline but with a moderate outlook. The overall impact on Apple's stock is expected to be relatively neutral to slightly negative due to the indirect nature of the effects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US presents both risks and opportunities for Apple Inc. The removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to a short-term loss of revenue for Apple, but the ban could also drive users to other social media platforms, potentially increasing traffic and engagement for companies like Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Considering the uncertainty and potential limited direct impact, the probabilities indicate a slight tilt towards a decline but not overwhelmingly so. The analysis of previous predictions from various models shows a consistent trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price falling due to the news, which suggests that the market sentiment is cautious about the potential impact of the TikTok ban on Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on the analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary entity by a specified deadline.

While the removal of TikTok from the App Store may lead to short-term negative sentiment and a potential dip in App Store revenue, Apple's business model is diverse and does not heavily rely on TikTok. Experts suggest that the revenue redirected from TikTok would likely benefit competitors, such as Google and Meta, rather than Apple directly. Thus, while there may be some short-term negative impact, the overall sentiment appears to slightly favor a decline in stock price. Most previous predictions leaned towards a modest probability of a price drop given the uncertainty and cautious investor sentiment surrounding the situation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The potential TikTok ban continues to present a mixed bag for Apple. While the removal of TikTok from the App Store might lead to a short-term dip in App Store revenue, the direct impact on Apple's core business is expected to be minimal. Redirection of TikTok's user base and ad revenue primarily benefits Meta and Alphabet. Considering the trend in previous predictions leaning towards a slight decrease in stock price driven by uncertainty, but acknowledging that Apple's direct exposure to TikTok's revenue is limited, I still anticipate a negative sentiment, but not as strong as before. Also model google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 in round 1 predicts a high probability of rising\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the removal of TikTok from the App Store could cause a short-term dip in App Store revenue and potentially negative PR, the impact is likely to be minimal. Apple's business model is highly diversified and doesn't rely heavily on any single app.  Redirection of TikTok's users and advertising revenue primarily benefits Meta and Alphabet.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a slight decrease in stock price due to uncertainty and potential negative sentiment. However, the magnitude of this impact is likely small given Apple's financial health and diverse revenue streams.  The fact that the direct exposure to TikTok's revenue for Apple is limited supports a muted impact on the stock price.  The slight increase in probabilities for a price rise in round 1 suggests a possible mean reversion effect in the predictions, but the overall negative sentiment still outweighs potential positive effects in the short term.  Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall, accounting for the uncertainty and potential for negative short-term investor sentiment, but acknowledging the minor direct impact on Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US presents a mixed impact on Apple Inc.

(AAPL) as it suggests a possible removal of TikTok from the App Store, which may negatively impact user sentiment and lead to a short-term revenue dip for Apple. While Apple's diversified business model means it is not heavily reliant on TikTok, the potential redirection of users and advertising revenue to competing platforms like Instagram and YouTube is likely to affect overall market sentiment negatively. Previous predictions show a consensus leaning slightly towards a decline in stock price due to cautious investor sentiment amidst uncertainties related to the legal challenges and their implications for Apple's public relations.

While the removal of TikTok from the App Store might cause some short-term headwinds, the consensus is that Apple's revenue stream is well-diversified, minimizing any significant impact. I will follow the trend in previous predictions leaning towards a slight decrease in stock price driven by uncertainty. Therefore, a greater probability is assigned to the stock price falling. Given the trend indicates a slightly falling stock then an equal response would be a poor result.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the removal of TikTok from the App Store could cause a short-term dip in App Store revenue and some negative PR, the direct impact on Apple's core business is likely minimal.  Apple's diverse revenue streams significantly reduce the impact of losing one app from its store. The redirection of TikTok's user base and advertising revenue largely benefits Meta and Alphabet more than Apple.  The majority of previous predictions from various models lean towards a slight decrease in stock price, driven by uncertainty and potential negative sentiment surrounding the removal of TikTok and the associated legal risks. However, the magnitude of this negative impact is expected to remain small, considering Apple's overall financial health and diversified revenue streams.
