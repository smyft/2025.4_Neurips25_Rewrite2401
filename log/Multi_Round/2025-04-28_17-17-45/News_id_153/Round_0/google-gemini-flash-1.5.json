(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Faces Challenges in 2025, but Q1 Earnings Likely to Beat Estimates\nNews Content: On January 30, Apple (AAPL, Financial) is set to post strongly ahead of the iPhone 16 on a fiscal first quarter of fiscal year 2025 earnings call. BofA analysts continue to see strong Q1 results but warn that the March quarter will be weak, with iPhone sales likely to decline to 49 million units versus the consensus of 52 million. Macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are to blame for the decline.\n\nBofA cut its iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 to 229 million for 2025 and 246 million for 2026 from 262 million each. However, the bank is still bullish on the stock, noting Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency and its possible pending product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. BofA says concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are overdone, given that it has cut prices and will receive potential government subsidies. Analysts adjust the price target for Apple to $253 from $256 as the company's new FY26 EPS forecast of $8.37 yields a 30x multiple.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, the forecast for subsequent quarters is weaker due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of new features.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales forecasts for FY25 and FY26 are a significant negative. However, BofA remains bullish citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential future product launches. The price target reduction is relatively minor ($3), suggesting the analysts still see significant value in the stock.  The news emphasizes near-term weakness but longer-term potential.  Considering the positive Q1 earnings expectation and the continued bullishness despite the lowered forecasts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, though uncertainty remains.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Faces Challenges in 2025, but Q1 Earnings Likely to Beat Estimates\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
