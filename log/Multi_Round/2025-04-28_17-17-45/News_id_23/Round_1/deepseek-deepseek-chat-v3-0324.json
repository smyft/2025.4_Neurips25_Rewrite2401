      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\nNews Content: The company\u2019s stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, but AI isn\u2019t driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline suggests that while there is some positive sentiment around AI news, it also indicates that significant upgrades related to AI are not yet affecting iPhone sales. This mixed message could lead to some optimism due to the mention of AI and DeepSeek news, but the overall caution regarding immediate consumer response may reduce the likelihood of a substantial rise in stock price. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise but a slightly higher probability of a fall due to the lack of immediate impact on sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a mixed impact on Apple stock. While the mention of 'DeepSeek news' implies a positive short-term boost, the core message is that AI advancements aren't yet translating into increased iPhone sales. This indicates that the positive impact might be fleeting, as sustained stock growth depends on tangible revenue increases. A balanced assessment considering the short-term lift and longer-term uncertainty leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall, as initial optimism may fade without immediate sales growth driven by artificial intelligence features. The news is generally cautiously optimistic, however not to the point where it indicates a guaranteed positive upward trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently experiencing a boost (likely due to the unrelated 'DeepSeek' news), the actual impact of Apple's AI efforts on iPhone upgrades and consequently, stock price, is not yet significant.  This implies that the current price surge isn't directly tied to Apple's progress in AI. The absence of immediate positive AI-related news might lead to a slight correction if the market had anticipated a more substantial impact. However, the overall sentiment remains somewhat positive with Apple enjoying a separate boost. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the effect is likely to be modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is seeing a temporary boost from AI-related news (DeepSeek), the actual impact of AI on iPhone upgrades is not yet significant. This indicates mixed sentiment\u2014short-term enthusiasm but longer-term uncertainty about AI's immediate contribution to revenue growth. Investors may react with cautious optimism, leading to modest upward movement, but the lack of a clear near-term catalyst could limit the upside. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both are tempered by the ambiguous outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still distant, which could imply that the current stock price boost from AI-related news is temporary or not sustainable. The content also mentions that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue and stock price in the short term. However, the stock is currently getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Based on this mixed information, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential overhyping of AI benefits and a delayed impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that the company's AI advancements are not yet having a significant impact on driving upgrades to iPhones. This implies that the recent boost in stock price due to the DeepSeek news may be temporary and not sustainable. As the news indicates that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, it may lead to a correction in the stock price. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which could limit the potential fall in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still significant due to the company's overall strength.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite some positive sentiment around Artificial Intelligence (AI) news, indicated by 'DeepSeek', the core aspect related to AI is not influencing consumer behavior towards upgrading their iPhones. This could imply that investor enthusiasm might be tempered due to the lack of immediate positive impact on sales or product adoption, which may lead to a cooling off in stock price gains.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
