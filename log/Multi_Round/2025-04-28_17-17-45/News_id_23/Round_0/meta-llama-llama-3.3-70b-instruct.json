This implies that the recent boost in stock price due to the DeepSeek news may be temporary and not sustainable. As the news indicates that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, it may lead to a correction in the stock price. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which could limit the potential fall in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still significant due to the company's overall strength.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}"
