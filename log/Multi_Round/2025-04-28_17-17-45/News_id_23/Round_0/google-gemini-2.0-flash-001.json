While the mention of 'DeepSeek news' implies a positive short-term boost, the core message is that AI advancements aren't yet translating into increased iPhone sales. This indicates that the positive impact might be fleeting, as sustained stock growth depends on tangible revenue increases. A balanced assessment considering the short-term lift and longer-term uncertainty leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall, as initial optimism may fade without immediate sales growth driven by artificial intelligence features. The news is generally cautiously optimistic, however not to the point where it indicates a guaranteed positive upward trend.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.40,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.60\n}\n```"
