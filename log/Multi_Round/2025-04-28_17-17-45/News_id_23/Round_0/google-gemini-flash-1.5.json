This implies that the current price surge isn't directly tied to Apple's progress in AI. The absence of immediate positive AI-related news might lead to a slight correction if the market had anticipated a more substantial impact. However, the overall sentiment remains somewhat positive with Apple enjoying a separate boost. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the effect is likely to be modest.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
