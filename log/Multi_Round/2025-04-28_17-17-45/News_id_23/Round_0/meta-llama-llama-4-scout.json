The content also mentions that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue and stock price in the short term. However, the stock is currently getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Based on this mixed information, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential overhyping of AI benefits and a delayed impact on iPhone upgrades.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
