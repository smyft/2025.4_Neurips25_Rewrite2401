      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\nNews Content: The company\u2019s stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, but AI isn\u2019t driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline suggests that while there is some positive sentiment around AI news, it also indicates that significant upgrades related to AI are not yet affecting iPhone sales. This mixed message could lead to some optimism due to the mention of AI and DeepSeek news, but the overall caution regarding immediate consumer response may reduce the likelihood of a substantial rise in stock price. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise but a slightly higher probability of a fall due to the lack of immediate impact on sales.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a mixed impact on Apple stock. While the mention of 'DeepSeek news' implies a positive short-term boost, the core message is that AI advancements aren't yet translating into increased iPhone sales. This indicates that the positive impact might be fleeting, as sustained stock growth depends on tangible revenue increases. A balanced assessment considering the short-term lift and longer-term uncertainty leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall, as initial optimism may fade without immediate sales growth driven by artificial intelligence features. The news is generally cautiously optimistic, however not to the point where it indicates a guaranteed positive upward trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is currently experiencing a boost (likely due to the unrelated 'DeepSeek' news), the actual impact of Apple's AI efforts on iPhone upgrades and consequently, stock price, is not yet significant.  This implies that the current price surge isn't directly tied to Apple's progress in AI. The absence of immediate positive AI-related news might lead to a slight correction if the market had anticipated a more substantial impact. However, the overall sentiment remains somewhat positive with Apple enjoying a separate boost. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the effect is likely to be modest.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple's stock is seeing a temporary boost from AI-related news (DeepSeek), the actual impact of AI on iPhone upgrades is not yet significant. This indicates mixed sentiment\u2014short-term enthusiasm but longer-term uncertainty about AI's immediate contribution to revenue growth. Investors may react with cautious optimism, leading to modest upward movement, but the lack of a clear near-term catalyst could limit the upside. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both are tempered by the ambiguous outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still distant, which could imply that the current stock price boost from AI-related news is temporary or not sustainable. The content also mentions that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue and stock price in the short term. However, the stock is currently getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. Based on this mixed information, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential overhyping of AI benefits and a delayed impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that the company's AI advancements are not yet having a significant impact on driving upgrades to iPhones. This implies that the recent boost in stock price due to the DeepSeek news may be temporary and not sustainable. As the news indicates that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, it may lead to a correction in the stock price. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which could limit the potential fall in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still significant due to the company's overall strength.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite some positive sentiment around Artificial Intelligence (AI) news, indicated by 'DeepSeek', the core aspect related to AI is not influencing consumer behavior towards upgrading their iPhones. This could imply that investor enthusiasm might be tempered due to the lack of immediate positive impact on sales or product adoption, which may lead to a cooling off in stock price gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. regarding its AI advancements and their impact on iPhone sales. While there is a temporary boost from the recent 'DeepSeek' news, the article emphasizes that AI is not yet significantly influencing consumer upgrades. This indicates that the current rise in stock price may be short-lived and not based on immediate revenue growth from AI features. Analysts are generally showing a cautious sentiment, reflecting both short-term optimism and longer-term uncertainties. After considering these aspects, I predict a lower probability of stock price increase, alongside a higher probability of a fall, as the market adjusts to the realization that immediate AI benefits may not materialize swiftly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. The 'DeepSeek news' provides a short-term boost, but the core message is that AI isn't yet significantly driving iPhone upgrades. This suggests the initial positive reaction might be followed by a correction as investors realize the immediate financial impact is limited. The previous round of models reflects a generally negative sentiment, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise. I am thus aligning my prediction with this viewpoint, though slightly less decisive since there *is* a positive movement mentioned. It feels most likely that there will be a modest sell-off.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While a short-term boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news is mentioned, the core message highlights the lack of significant immediate impact of Apple's AI advancements on iPhone sales.  This suggests the current positive sentiment might be fleeting. The previous predictions show a range of opinions; some are cautiously optimistic, believing the 'DeepSeek' news might offset the negative impact of AI news, while others are more pessimistic, predicting a higher probability of a price fall due to the absence of a strong AI-driven sales catalyst. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a clear positive driver related to AI, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of the 'DeepSeek' news temporarily mitigating this effect.  The overall uncertainty and the potential for the 'DeepSeek' boost to fade outweigh the currently weak positive signal from the AI news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's stock. While there is a short-term boost from the DeepSeek news related to AI, the core message is that AI is not yet driving significant iPhone upgrades, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this ambiguity, with slight variations in optimism. Considering the temporary nature of the boost and the lack of immediate impact on sales, the probability of the stock price rising is marginally lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's AI moment is still distant, indicating that the current stock price boost from AI-related news (DeepSeek) may be temporary. The content also mentions that AI isn't driving a rush to upgrade iPhones yet, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue and stock price in the short term. However, the overall sentiment remains somewhat positive due to the separate boost from unrelated news. Based on this mixed information, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential overhyping of AI benefits and a delayed impact on iPhone upgrades.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' and the content suggest a mixed impact on Apple's stock. While there is a short-term boost due to the DeepSeek news, the lack of immediate positive impact of AI on iPhone upgrades may temper investor enthusiasm. Considering the varied predictions from other models, which seem to weigh the short-term optimism against longer-term uncertainty, the overall sentiment appears cautiously optimistic but with concerns about sustained growth. The majority of predictions lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling or a modest rise at best, indicating a cautious market stance due to the absence of a clear near-term catalyst for significant growth. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, slightly lower than a fall, reflecting the mixed sentiment and uncertainty around AI's immediate contribution to Apple's revenue and stock performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding the impact of Artificial Intelligence on Apple's business. While the stock is experiencing a temporary boost attributed to the DeepSeek news, the core issue is that AI isn't driving immediate upgrades of iPhones. There's an indication that investors might see the current stock price increase as overhyped given that the immediate impact on iPhone upgrades and revenues is not evident. Considering previous predictions suggesting a predominantly cautious or skeptical view, along with the ambiguity around the sustainability of the stock price increase, it points to a scenario where the likelihood of a price fall may be higher than a rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The mixed sentiment surrounding the news indicates that while there is some short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek' news, the core issue is the lack of immediate impact from AI advancements on iPhone sales. Most predictions lean towards a cautious outlook, reflecting that the initial optimism may not be sustainable without tangible revenue growth linked to AI. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price falling due to the uncertainty around immediate AI benefits and the potential for the recent boost to fade.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture. While DeepSeek news offers a temporary boost, the core issue is that AI isn't currently driving iPhone upgrades. Previous rounds of predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting concerns about the sustainability of the boost and the lack of immediate AI-driven revenue. I'm aligning with this cautious sentiment, acknowledging the temporary positive influence but emphasizing the more significant impact of delayed AI benefits. Furthermore, the overall market sentiment seems to be already factoring in the AI potential and any delay in its materialization would likely push more investors to sell the stock, which would significantly increase the probability of stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a short-term boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news is present, the core message focuses on the lack of significant impact from Apple's AI advancements on immediate iPhone sales. This suggests the current positive sentiment might be fleeting.  The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to the absence of a strong AI-driven sales catalyst. The temporary nature of the DeepSeek boost and the lack of immediate impact from AI on sales suggest the upward momentum is unlikely to be sustained. While Apple's overall strength could mitigate a significant fall, the lack of a clear positive driver from AI increases the chance for a correction.  Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek' news related to AI, the core message is that AI is not yet driving significant iPhone upgrades, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Previous predictions from other models reflect this ambiguity, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the lack of immediate impact on sales. The temporary nature of the boost and the absence of a clear near-term catalyst for significant growth suggest a cautious market stance.

While there is a short-term boost attributed to unrelated 'DeepSeek' news, the core message does not support a long-term positive impact on Apple's revenue. Several previous predictions from different models indicate a cautious or slightly negative sentiment, highlighting the ambiguity and mixed signals surrounding AI's near-term contributions. Although there is some optimism due to the temporary boost, the broader market sentiment, as reflected in the predictions, leans towards a scenario where the absence of a clear long-term driver may result in a correction.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The financial news suggests mixed sentiment regarding Apple's stock, with a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news. However, it emphasizes that AI advancements are not yet impacting iPhone upgrades significantly. Most predictions indicate a cautious outlook for the stock, leaning towards higher probabilities of a price fall due to the uncertainty around immediate AI benefits and the potential for the recent boost to fade. Thus, while there might be some short-term optimism, the overall sentiment appears to be more negative, with a greater chance of price correction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. The 'DeepSeek' news provides a short-term positive impact, but the core message is that AI isn't driving immediate iPhone upgrades. The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting concerns about the sustainability of the boost and the lack of immediate, tangible AI-driven revenue. Considering the increasing consensus around a negative outlook and the likely fade of the 'DeepSeek' boost, I predict a higher probability of the stock price falling. In past rounds, there is a general consensus in reducing the probability of stock price increase, showing an agreement that the impact of AI may not be immediate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a short-term boost from unrelated 'DeepSeek' news is acknowledged, the core message focuses on the lack of significant immediate impact from Apple's AI advancements on iPhone sales. This suggests the current positive sentiment might be fleeting.  The consensus among previous model predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to the absence of a strong AI-driven sales catalyst. The temporary nature of the DeepSeek boost and the lack of immediate impact from AI on sales suggest the upward momentum is unlikely to be sustained.  While Apple's overall strength could mitigate a significant fall, the lack of a clear positive driver from AI increases the chance for a correction. Considering the mixed signals and the overwhelmingly negative trend in previous predictions, I predict a higher probability of a price fall than a rise. The consistent downward trend in the probability of a price rise across the three rounds further strengthens this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek' news related to AI, the core message is that AI is not yet driving significant iPhone upgrades, which could temper investor enthusiasm.

While there is some short-term optimism, the core message indicates that AI advancements are not yet driving significant iPhone upgrades or revenue growth. This mixed outlook, with a focus on the lack of immediate impact from AI on iPhone sales, leads to a cautious sentiment. Most predictions from previous models lean towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, reflecting concerns about the sustainability of the boost and the delayed impact of AI on sales. Considering the temporary nature of the boost and the absence of a clear near-term catalyst for significant growth, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, slightly lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's stock due to the news about its AI advancements. While there is a short-term boost from the 'DeepSeek' news, the core message emphasizes that AI is not yet driving significant iPhone upgrades, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, reflecting concerns about the sustainability of the boost and the lack of immediate AI-driven revenue growth. Considering the temporary nature of the boost, the absence of a clear near-term catalyst for significant growth, and the cautious market stance, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise but a slightly higher probability of a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
