(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market, in collaboration with Google, intensifies competition in a sector where Apple is also a key player with its Vision Pro product. This news suggests a potential threat to Apple's market share and innovation leadership in the AR space. Given that competition might lead to increased pressure on Apple to accelerate their AR developments and pricing strategies, there is a higher likelihood of a negative impact on investor sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability of stock price fall as investors may react negatively to the increased competition while concurrently acknowledging Apple's existing market strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. While competition can spur innovation, it also puts downward pressure on potential market share and pricing for Apple's products. Apple's Vision Pro is also mentioned with limitations. This suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, a stock price fall is slightly more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, aiming to compete with Meta and Apple, is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While it doesn't directly threaten Apple's existing products, it introduces increased competition in a burgeoning market that Apple is actively pursuing (as evidenced by the Vision Pro). The article highlights Apple's challenges in bringing enough compelling apps to its Vision Pro headset, suggesting that even with its first-mover advantage, successfully launching an AR product is not guaranteed.  The increased competition could put downward pressure on Apple's AR ambitions and potentially impact future revenue projections in that sector. However, Apple's overall strength and diverse product portfolio likely mitigates the impact, making a significant price drop unlikely. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is low, while the probability of a price decrease is slightly higher but still within a relatively narrow range.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's entry into the AR glasses market, competing with Apple and others. While increased competition could be seen as a negative for Apple, the news does not directly impact Apple's current products or financials. Apple has been guarded about its AR plans, and the market may not react strongly to a competitor's announcement unless it directly threatens Apple's market position. The overall sentiment of the news is neutral for Apple, as it doesn't provide new information about Apple's own AR initiatives or financial performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is entering the AR glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially compete with Apple's upcoming AR products. While this development doesn't directly impact Apple's current financials, it may influence investor perception about Apple's future market share in the AR space. Given that Apple has been working on AR technology and has a product like the Vision Pro, the competition from Samsung and Google might be seen as a long-term challenge. However, Apple's strong ecosystem and historical performance often mitigate competitive pressures in the short term. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities reflect a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's plans to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially compete with Apple's own efforts in this space. Given that Apple has already struggled to bring enough content to its own AR device, the $3,500 Vision Pro, the entrance of a major competitor like Samsung could further exacerbate this issue and impact Apple's market share. Additionally, the fact that Samsung is working with Google to develop a unified OS for wearable headsets could pose a significant challenge to Apple's ecosystem. However, it's worth noting that Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer loyalty, which could help mitigate the impact of this news. Overall, the entrance of Samsung into the AR glasses market is likely to increase competition for Apple, potentially leading to a decrease in its stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a significant competitor in the tech sector, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in a promising technological sector that Apple has also been developing for some time, though keeping the public details vague. This competition might lead Apple to face challenges in capturing a larger share of the potential AR market. However, since Apple's Vision Pro has been struggling with app and content availability, increased competition could push Apple to enhance its ecosystem, potentially offsetting these risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
