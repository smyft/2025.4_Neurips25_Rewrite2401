(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in the cloud computing space and its joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, which may indicate potential growth for Oracle. However, Apple's stock is currently facing pressures, such as weak iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. Given the overall negative sentiments surrounding Apple, combined with the recent significant decline in its stock price, the likelihood of a further drop seems higher than a rise. The focus of the news is more on Oracle, so the direct impact on Apple is less significant, but the adverse conditions prevailing could influence its performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Oracle's potential rise in the cloud computing market due to a large joint venture and apparent backing from President Trump. This positive sentiment is tempered by skepticism from Elon Musk and Anthropic's CEO regarding the feasibility of the venture, and analysts pointing out that earnings expectations haven't significantly increased despite the stock rally. Apple is mentioned negatively in the 'Tech Chart of the Day' due to weakening iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. Considering these factors, Oracle (ORCL) is likely to experience price action due to the news. Though it is generally accepted for stock price to increase, there is not enough information to give it a strong rise. Apple (AAPL)'s price is much more likely to decrease due to the report of lower iPhone demand.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Oracle's significant investment in AI infrastructure and its potential impact on the cloud computing market.  This news is largely irrelevant to Apple (AAPL). The article also highlights Apple's recent stock slump due to weak iPhone sales and increasing concerns about competition, particularly regarding the Indian market and new phone designs from competitors such as Samsung. Analyst downgrades further support the negative outlook for Apple. While the Oracle news is positive for Oracle, it has no direct bearing on Apple's financial performance or stock price.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is very low, while the probability of a fall remains high due to existing headwinds already impacting Apple's stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle Corp. and its joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI, which is expected to boost its cloud computing business. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) only in the context of its recent stock performance, noting a nearly 11% slump in January due to concerns over weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. The news does not provide any direct positive or negative impact on Apple's stock from Oracle's developments. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal, as the news is not directly related to Apple's business operations or fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news article primarily focuses on Oracle Corp.'s new joint venture and its implications for the company's cloud business. However, the task is to analyze the impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions Apple in the context of its stock slump in January, with concerns over weak iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts. Despite the overall positive sentiment around Oracle's announcement, the specific mention of Apple is negative, highlighting potential concerns for investors. Therefore, based on the information given, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall or remain under pressure due to the mentioned concerns rather than rise based on the Oracle news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact' does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article mentions that Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022, due to weak iPhone sales. Additionally, India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. over social services, safety standards, and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's strategic move with a significant AI-focused joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud computing capabilities. This has generated speculation and mixed reactions from analysts, noting both potential growth opportunities and risks related to execution and timing uncertainties. While this news has positively impacted Oracle's stock price recently, it has shown no similar effect on its earnings estimations and remains above historical valuation multiples, potentially impacting investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's significant developments in the cloud computing space and its partnership with SoftBank and OpenAI. While this indicates potential growth for Oracle, there are several factors negatively affecting Apple, such as recent analyst downgrades, concerns regarding weak iPhone sales, and a significant decline in its stock price. Given the overall negative sentiment towards Apple in the context of this news, the likelihood of a further drop in stock price seems higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's AI initiatives and their potential impact on the cloud computing market. While this is positive for Oracle, it has limited direct positive implications for Apple. More importantly, the news highlights Apple's recent stock slump due to weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and potential challenges in the Indian market. These are significant negative factors weighing on Apple's stock. Even if Oracle's news creates a general market uplift, Apple's specific headwinds make a price fall more probable. Most round models tend to agree that the apple stock is more likely to fall. However, one round model's prediction is opposite, which should be taken into consideration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Oracle's ambitious AI venture, which has little direct impact on Apple.  While the Oracle news might indirectly affect the broader tech market sentiment, the article highlights significant negative factors specifically impacting Apple: a nearly 11% January slump, weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and potential conflict with India over app store regulations. These negative factors significantly outweigh any potential positive spillover from Oracle's positive news.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the consensus leans toward a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.  Considering the current market sentiment towards Apple and the lack of positive news directly affecting the company, the probability of a stock price fall remains higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in cloud computing and its joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, Apple is mentioned in a negative context, highlighting an 11% slump in January due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. Additionally, there are concerns about Apple's market position in India and competitive pressures from Samsung. Given these factors, the likelihood of Apple's stock price falling is higher than rising, as the news does not present any positive catalysts for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in the cloud computing space and its joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI. While this news has the potential to positively impact Oracle's stock price, it has minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple is mentioned in the context of its recent stock slump due to concerns over weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. Considering the negative sentiment surrounding Apple and the lack of direct positive news about the company, it seems more likely that Apple's stock price will fall or remain under pressure. However, given the speculative nature of stock market predictions and the potential for unforeseen events, a small probability of a stock price rise cannot be entirely ruled out.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Oracle and its joint venture in the cloud computing space, backed by President Trump. Apple is only mentioned in the context of its recent negative performance due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. There is no direct positive or negative impact on Apple from the Oracle news. Several models predict a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling based on the existing headwinds impacting the stock.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news primarily revolves around Oracle's developments and a significant joint venture with SoftBank and OpenAI, which may positively impact Oracle's stock but has limited direct relevance to Apple. Meanwhile, Apple's stock is facing downward pressure due to weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and competition in international markets. This context suggests a higher probability of further decline in Apple's stock price, as most analyses indicate strong negative sentiment around its recent performance. Therefore, while some uncertainty exists, the overwhelming consensus points toward a likelihood of fall rather than rise for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle's developments in cloud computing, which has no direct positive effect on Apple. The article explicitly states that Apple's stock is slumping in January due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. Other negative factors are mentioned, such as potential conflicts in the Indian market and competition from Samsung. The previous round of predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling, strengthening this conclusion. While there may be some market volatility, all signs point towards a continued downward trend for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on Oracle's significant AI investment and its potential impact on the cloud computing market. This is largely irrelevant to Apple.  The article highlights Apple's significant challenges: weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and potential conflicts in the Indian market. These negative factors significantly outweigh any potential indirect positive influence from Oracle's success. The consensus from previous models is that Apple's stock is more likely to fall. While a small probability of a rise due to overall market sentiment cannot be completely discounted, the current situation regarding Apple's performance makes a price drop significantly more probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided financial news primarily discusses Oracle's joint venture in cloud computing and its potential implications for Oracle's growth, with minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple is mentioned in a negative context, highlighting an 11% slump in January due to weak iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and potential regulatory challenges in India. Given these negative factors and the lack of any positive catalysts for Apple in the news, the likelihood of Apple's stock price falling is higher than rising. The consensus from previous predictions also supports this view, with most models predicting a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news primarily focuses on Oracle Corp.'s joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI, aimed at expanding data centers to support artificial intelligence applications.
