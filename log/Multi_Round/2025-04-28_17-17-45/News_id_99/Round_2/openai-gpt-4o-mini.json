(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price.

Although the Nasdaq futures are pointing higher, which suggests some recovery after a steep sell-off, the uncertainty surrounding AI spending and the upcoming quarterly earnings reports create a cautious sentiment. Apple's stock is at risk due to the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector, particularly after a significant drop in Nvidia's stock. The mixed outlook from analysts on whether the market overreacted indicates that there is no clear consensus. Therefore, while there is potential for a recovery, the concerns from the market suggest an elevated risk of further declines. This leads to a higher probability of the stock falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Positively, Nasdaq futures are up slightly, indicating a potential rebound after the tech sell-off. However, the core driver of the sell-off is the emergence of DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model that is directly impacting Apple as its app surpassed ChatGPT in downloads. The success of DeepSeek raises concerns about the potential for reduced spending on AI within the tech industry and places pressure on companies like Apple to demonstrate the value of their AI investments, specifically mentioned within the article related to earnings outlook. The article states this has been considered by U.S. President Donald Trump as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for American companies, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledging the impressiveness of the DeepSeek Model. Furthermore, Apple is reporting earnings this week, intensifying focus on its AI strategy. Though not explicitly stated, the success of the Chinese app may also reduce projected app download revenue, and also poses the prospect that Apple's products may fall behind more cheaply produced and equally capable AI software. Given the potential negative impact of DeepSeek's model alongside earnings coming this week, the probability of a price decrease or static movement is more elevated than a price rise. As such, a price decrease seems to be more likely in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily involved in AI development like Nvidia, Apple's direct involvement is less pronounced.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related spending and the competitive landscape.  Apple is reporting earnings soon, and investor sentiment will be influenced by those results and its commentary on AI. The fact that DeepSeek's app topped the App Store charts *could* be marginally positive for Apple, showcasing the App Store's prominence, but this effect is likely overshadowed by the broader market concerns.  Therefore, the overall impact on Apple is expected to be relatively muted compared to companies more directly exposed to the AI chip market or heavy AI development spending. The probability of a price rise is lower considering the prevailing negative sentiment in the tech sector, while a fall isn't highly likely due to Apple's relative insulation from the immediate AI-related concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in technology stocks, particularly in the AI sector, due to concerns over the impact of China's DeepSeek AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is indirectly affected as the AI sector's volatility impacts broader tech sentiment and investor confidence. However, the news also mentions that Nasdaq futures are up, indicating some recovery from the sell-off. Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by the overall market reaction to the tech earnings reports this week, including its own earnings report on Thursday. The sell-off may have been an overreaction, but concerns about AI spending and competition persist.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans, causing a sell-off in technology stocks. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as the chatbot based on DeepSeek's model became the best-selling app on Apple's App Store, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted that DeepSeek's model is impressive but OpenAI plans to deliver better models, suggesting that the impact on Apple may be neutral or slightly negative due to potential disruption in AI spending. Given that Nasdaq futures are up after the sell-off and Nvidia rises in extended hours trading, there's a possibility of recovery, but the overall sentiment remains cautious.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on the US tech industry, particularly on companies like Nvidia and Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek's model has sparked concerns over the massive spending on AI by US tech companies, leading to a sell-off in tech stocks. However, OpenAI's CEO has downplayed the impact, stating that more computing power is still important for AI research. Given that Apple is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Thursday, the market may be cautious, but the fact that DeepSeek's assistant became the best-selling app on Apple's App Store could be seen as a positive sign. Overall, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the mixed signals from the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a sell-off in tech stocks due to concerns over Chinese AI firms and their potential impact on US tech companies' spending on AI. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of DeepSeek's AI model impacting market sentiment towards AI investment. While the article does not directly indicate a negative outlook for Apple, it suggests broader concerns about the tech sector. Since Apple operates in the technology space, it may be affected by this broader market sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses significant concerns among investors regarding the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on major tech companies like Apple, which is compounded by a fear of reduced AI spending in the sector. Although there is a slight uptick in Nasdaq futures indicating a potential recovery, the overarching sentiment remains cautious due to the prior steep sell-off. Apple's upcoming earnings report and the implications of DeepSeek's recent success make a price decrease more likely in the short term as investors evaluate the risks and uncertainties surrounding AI competition and spending strategies.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but overall negative outlook for Apple. While Nasdaq futures show a slight rebound, the underlying cause of the recent sell-off \u2013 the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential to disrupt AI spending \u2013 remains a significant concern. The fact that DeepSeek's app surpassed ChatGPT on Apple's App Store is a direct, tangible indicator of this disruption. Apple's upcoming earnings report is now under increased scrutiny, with pressure to justify its AI investments. Furthermore, the acknowledgment of DeepSeek's achievements by figures like Donald Trump and Sam Altman adds weight to the potential negative impact. The trend of previous predictions indicates a shifting sentiment towards a more negative outlook, suggesting that others may have incorporated external negative indicators. Therefore, the probability of a price decrease is elevated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The broad sell-off in tech stocks driven by concerns over DeepSeek's low-cost AI model creates a negative backdrop. This is amplified by the significant drop in Nvidia's stock, a key player in the AI space. While Nasdaq futures are slightly up, suggesting a potential recovery, the uncertainty around AI spending and the upcoming earnings reports remain major factors.  The fact that DeepSeek's app topped Apple's App Store charts is a mixed signal \u2013 demonstrating app store strength but potentially highlighting competitive pressures.  Analysts are divided on the market's overreaction, indicating considerable uncertainty.  Considering the prevailing negative sentiment in the sector and the fact that Apple's earnings are imminent, this further adds to uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most falling around a 45-55% split. I'll skew slightly more cautious given the negative market sentiment, however the overall situation makes it difficult to confidently predict a significant directional price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to the broader tech sector sell-off triggered by concerns over DeepSeek's low-cost AI model. While the model's success has raised questions about AI spending by Big Tech, Apple's direct exposure is relatively limited compared to companies like Nvidia. The article mentions that DeepSeek's app became the best-selling on Apple's App Store, which could be a positive for Apple's services segment. However, the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and upcoming earnings reports add uncertainty. Previous predictions largely leaned towards a higher probability of the stock falling, reflecting cautious market sentiment. Considering these factors, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure, but the potential for a rebound exists if earnings or other positive developments offset the concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns over the impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans, leading to a sell-off in technology stocks. Apple's stock is indirectly affected due to its presence in the tech sector and the upcoming earnings report. However, the fact that DeepSeek's assistant became the best-selling app on Apple's App Store could be seen as a positive sign. The mixed outlook from analysts and the cautious sentiment in the market suggest that while there is potential for recovery, the risk of further declines is elevated. Considering the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the upcoming earnings report, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant concern over the impact of a low-cost AI model introduced by DeepSeek on Big Tech's spending plans, which has led to a sell-off in technology stocks. However, Nasdaq futures are pointing higher, suggesting some recovery after the sell-off. Apple's stock is at risk due to the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector. The success of DeepSeek's model and its impact on Apple's App Store, as well as the upcoming earnings report, contribute to the uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals from the news and the cautious sentiment in the tech sector, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the analysis of the news and the previous predictions provided.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks driven by concerns over Chinese AI firms and their potential impact on US tech companies' spending on AI. Apple (AAPL) is indirectly impacted through broader market sentiment, but OpenAI CEO's comments suggest that the impact might not be extreme. While Nvidia experienced a significant drop, the mixed reactions from different parties and the recovery in Nasdaq futures contribute to a cautious outlook.
