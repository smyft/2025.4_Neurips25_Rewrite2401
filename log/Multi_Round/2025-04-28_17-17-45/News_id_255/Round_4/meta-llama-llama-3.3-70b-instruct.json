(AAPL)\nNews Headline: SYF Offers Greater Flexibility With Apple Pay's Pay Later Feature\nNews Content: Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The announcement of Synchrony Financial offering a 'Pay Later' feature with Apple Pay indicates a strategic enhancement in customer flexibility, potentially boosting transaction volumes. This is expected to enhance customer loyalty and attract new users, positively impacting Synchrony's revenue through increased utilization of its credit products. The overall sentiment is optimistic, especially since this feature may drive more transactions through Apple Pay, benefiting both Synchrony and indirectly Apple as the name behind the wallet service. Given these positive developments, the market response could favorably affect Apple's stock value as well, but with less direct impact than on Synchrony's stock. Therefore, I estimate a higher chance of price rise for Apple due to the affiliation with Synchrony's new offerings fueling more transactions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Synchrony Financial (SYF) is offering greater flexibility with Apple Pay's Pay Later feature, which benefits both SYF and indirectly Apple. For Synchrony, it can attract new customers and retain existing ones, leading to increased use of their credit cards and higher revenues from interest and fees. For Apple, it increases the utility of apple pay for customers. However, this article is not really covering Apple's story, it is focused on Synchrony. The impact on Apple's stock is more tangential based on this article. Although SYF's success is not guaranteed to translate to a material increase in Apple's revenue, the news is slightly positive overall for Apple and this partnership can slightly increase customer satisfaction of apple pay. The article mentions that SYF stock has performed very strongly in the past year so, although any rise is likely to be small, it's slightly more likely to go up than down. Considering the overall market conditions and other factors would be important to assess the most likely direction accurately.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its expanded partnership with Apple Pay.  While this is positive for SYF, the news article does not directly relate to Apple (AAPL)'s stock price.  The increased usage of Synchrony's credit cards through Apple Pay might indirectly benefit Apple through increased transaction volume on its platform, but this effect is likely to be small and indirect. The headline and article primarily highlight the benefits for SYF, such as increased revenue from interest and fees. Therefore, there is little reason to expect a significant impact on AAPL's stock price from this news. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors and not this specific announcement. The probability of a rise or fall is therefore close to a neutral position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as its Apple Pay's Pay Later feature is being expanded through Synchrony Financial's credit cards. This collaboration enhances the flexibility and convenience for consumers using Apple Pay, potentially increasing usage and adoption of Apple's payment solutions. Given Apple's strong brand and the positive reception of its digital payment services, this news is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a rise in Apple's stock price. There are no immediate negative implications mentioned that would suggest a decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its partnership with Apple Pay to offer a 'Pay Later' feature. This development enhances the flexibility and purchasing power of consumers using Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay. The news does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is the company mentioned in the query. Since the news is more beneficial to Synchrony Financial, it is unlikely to have a direct significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, the association with Apple Pay could indirectly reflect positively on Apple Inc. due to the expanded usability and convenience of its payment system. Given the indirect and minor nature of the impact, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are relatively balanced with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to increased ecosystem convenience.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article announces the availability of Apple Pay's Pay Later feature for Synchrony Mastercard holders, providing customers with more flexibility and convenience in their payment options. This feature is expected to attract new customers and retain existing ones, potentially leading to increased utilization of Synchrony's credit cards and growth in interest and fees on loans. Given the positive impact on Synchrony's business, it is likely that the stock price will rise. However, the article also mentions that Synchrony currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which may indicate a neutral outlook from investors. Additionally, the article highlights the performance of other stocks in the Finance space, which may influence investor sentiment. Considering these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a new feature offered by Synchrony Financial (SYF) in partnership with Apple Pay, which provides flexible payment options such as fixed monthly payments. This initiative could lead to increased usage of Synchrony's credit cards, boosting revenue from interest and fees. The news is positive for Synchrony as it enhances customer convenience and flexibility, which could attract more customers and retain existing ones. Additionally, Synchrony's stock has performed strongly in the past year, gaining 89.6% compared to the industry's 24.5% growth. The strong performance and positive outlook make the stock appealing.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The announcement of Synchrony Financial's Pay Later feature in collaboration with Apple Pay is likely to enhance customer convenience and potentially increase transaction volumes on the Apple platform. This could lead to higher adoption and utilization of Apple's payment services, which serves to indirectly benefit Apple Inc. The positive sentiments surrounding Synchrony's offering and its strong performance over the past year suggest an optimistic outlook for Apple as well. Therefore, while the direct impact on AAPL may be limited, the overall sentiment and potential for increased transaction volume support a higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) enhanced 'Pay Later' feature integration with Apple Pay. While primarily benefiting SYF by potentially attracting new customers, increasing transaction volume, and boosting revenue, the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect. The increased convenience and usage of Apple Pay could marginally increase transaction volume on its platform. Previous predictions varied, with some leaning towards a positive impact and others viewing it as neutral. Considering the indirect benefit and the mixed sentiments from previous rounds, I believe a slightly positive but not significant impact is likely. Also considering some predicted low values, there might be some negative underlying information that I don't have access to.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, offering a 'Pay Later' option. While this is positive for SYF, the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal.  The increased transaction volume through Apple Pay might marginally benefit Apple, but it's not a direct or significant driver of AAPL's stock price. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities for AAPL stock movement, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the fact that it's primarily about SYF's growth, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The previous predictions show a slight tendency towards a rise due to the enhanced convenience of Apple Pay, but this is likely to be overshadowed by broader market factors affecting AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I am assigning probabilities closer to neutral, reflecting the limited direct influence of the news on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) partnership with Apple Pay to offer a 'Pay Later' feature, which enhances customer flexibility and could boost SYF's revenue through increased credit card usage. While this development indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) by potentially increasing Apple Pay transactions, the direct impact on AAPL's stock is minimal. Previous predictions suggest a slightly positive sentiment for AAPL, but the consensus leans towards a neutral to mildly optimistic outlook due to the indirect nature of the news. Considering these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Synchrony Financial (SYF) offering a 'Pay Later' feature with Apple Pay, which enhances customer flexibility and convenience. While the news directly benefits Synchrony Financial, it also indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) by increasing the utility and adoption of Apple Pay. The overall sentiment is positive, as this partnership can lead to increased transaction volumes and customer satisfaction for Apple Pay users. Given the indirect but positive impact on Apple's ecosystem and the lack of negative implications, there is a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article announces the availability of Apple Pay's Pay Later feature for Synchrony Mastercard holders, which provides customers with more flexibility and convenience in their payment options. This development is expected to have a positive impact on Synchrony Financial's business, potentially leading to increased utilization of its credit cards and growth in interest and fees on loans. Although the news primarily focuses on Synchrony Financial, the association with Apple Pay could indirectly reflect positively on Apple Inc. due to the expanded usability and convenience of its payment system. Considering the indirect and minor nature of the impact on Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling for AAPL are relatively balanced with a slight inclination towards a positive impact. Given the overall positive sentiment and the potential for increased transaction volumes through Apple Pay, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a new feature offered by Synchrony Financial (SYF) in partnership with Apple Pay, which provides flexible payment options such as fixed monthly payments. This initiative could lead to increased usage of Synchrony's credit cards, boosting revenue from interest and fees. The news is primarily positive for Synchrony, potentially attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. While the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect, the enhanced usability and convenience of Apple Pay could positively influence investor sentiments towards Apple. The previous predictions for AAPL are moderately positive, suggesting a trend of belief in the potential benefit from this announcement. However, considering the indirect nature of the relationship, the probability should be slightly weighted towards a neutral position.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news regarding Synchrony Financial's new 'Pay Later' feature integrated into Apple Pay enhances the flexibility of payment options for consumers, which could lead to increased transaction volume on the Apple Pay platform. While the primary focus of the announcement is on Synchrony, the indirect benefits to Apple from increased usage of its payment service are notable. Many previous predictions indicate a slight positive sentiment towards Apple, reflecting the potential for increased customer satisfaction and usage of Apple Pay. Given these factors, I estimate a moderately high probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising, while the probability of it falling remains lower due to the overall positive association with the extended payment options offered through Synchrony.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) 'Pay Later' feature integrated with Apple Pay. While primarily benefiting SYF by potentially attracting new customers and boosting revenue, the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely small. Increased convenience and usage of Apple Pay may marginally increase transaction volume. Previous predictions show a slight leaning towards a positive impact, but some predicted low values, suggesting the possibility of unseen negative information although the news itself is positive. I will adjust my judgment to factor in for them in a mixed sentiment. Considering the indirect benefit and the need to account for potential negative factors, I will predict a slightly higher probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) partnership with Apple Pay, offering a 'Pay Later' option.  This primarily benefits SYF, potentially boosting their revenue and attracting new customers. The impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal. Increased Apple Pay transactions might marginally benefit Apple, but it won't be a significant driver of AAPL's stock price.  Previous predictions show a wide range, from neutral to moderately positive, reflecting the uncertainty. The indirect nature of the news, coupled with the stronger focus on SYF's growth, suggests a limited impact on AAPL.  Considering the mixed and mostly slightly positive sentiments from multiple previous predictions, incorporating the indirect nature of the benefit to Apple, and accounting for other market factors influencing AAPL, I'm assigning probabilities closer to neutral, with a slightly higher chance of a rise reflecting potential increased Apple Pay usage.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) partnership with Apple Pay to offer a 'Pay Later' feature, which enhances customer flexibility and could boost SYF's revenue through increased credit card usage. While this development indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) by potentially increasing Apple Pay transactions, the direct impact on AAPL's stock is minimal. Previous predictions suggest a slightly positive sentiment for AAPL, but the consensus leans towards a neutral to mildly optimistic outlook due to the indirect nature of the news. Considering these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news about Synchrony Financial offering a 'Pay Later' feature with Apple Pay is primarily positive for Synchrony but has an indirect impact on Apple Inc. The enhanced flexibility and convenience for Apple Pay users could lead to increased transaction volumes and customer satisfaction, indirectly benefiting Apple. Considering the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of negative implications, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. The previous predictions from various models show a range of sentiments, from neutral to mildly optimistic, which supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a new 'Pay Later' feature being rolled out by Synchrony Financial (SYF) for Apple Pay users. While this development is expected to benefit Synchrony Financial directly by increasing its transaction volume and customer base, its impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is indirect. Enhanced functionality and convenience for Apple Pay users may positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple. However, the news predominantly centers around Synchrony Financial and their strategic move, suggesting limited direct influence on Apple's stock price. Previous predictions for AAPL are moderately positive, leaning towards a marginal positive impact due to enhanced ecosystem convenience.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news about Synchrony Financial's partnership with Apple Pay introducing a 'Pay Later' feature primarily benefits Synchrony, as it enhances customer flexibility and could increase transaction volumes for their credit products. While the direct impact on Apple Inc. is less significant, there are indirect benefits to Apple through potential increases in usage of Apple Pay, which could enhance overall customer satisfaction and drive higher transaction volumes on their platform. Previous predictions indicate a trend towards a positive sentiment for Apple's stock, albeit cautiously, reflecting the indirect nature of the benefits. Taking these factors into account, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) 'Pay Later' feature with Apple Pay. The primary beneficiary is SYF as it can attract new customers, boosting its revenue. For Apple (AAPL), the benefits are indirect as more transactions through Apple Pay might lead to a slight rise in revenue. However, the article does not focus on AAPL; the positive impact is expected to be limited. Taking into account previous rounds of predictions leaning toward a positive impact, but acknowledging various models predict potentially negative trends which may stem from information unavailable due to the limits of what I have access to, and weighing the modest indirect benefit of this news on Apple, the probability of AAPL rising is slightly above average. In addition, the prior rounds' analysis suggests that there are some models which give opposite evaluation, which I need to take this into consideration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) partnership with Apple Pay, offering a 'Pay Later' option. This is positive for SYF, potentially increasing revenue and attracting new customers.  However, the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal. Increased Apple Pay transactions might marginally benefit Apple, but it won't be a significant driver of AAPL's stock price.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from neutral to moderately positive, reflecting the uncertainty.  The indirect nature of the news and stronger focus on SYF's growth suggest a limited impact on AAPL. Considering the mixed sentiments, the indirect benefit to Apple, and the potential influence of broader market factors, the probabilities are close to neutral. The slight positive leaning in some predictions reflects the potential for increased Apple Pay usage. Overall, the news is unlikely to cause a significant stock movement for AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Synchrony Financial's (SYF) partnership with Apple Pay, offering a 'Pay Later' feature to its customers. While this development is positive for Synchrony by potentially increasing transaction volumes and customer retention, its impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is indirect. The enhanced convenience and flexibility of Apple Pay may marginally increase its usage, but the direct effect on Apple's stock price is minimal. Previous predictions from various models indicate a range of sentiments, from neutral to mildly optimistic, reflecting the indirect nature of the news. Therefore, while there is a slight positive sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Synchrony Financial (SYF) offering a 'Pay Later' feature with Apple Pay, enhancing customer flexibility and convenience. While the news directly benefits Synchrony Financial, it also indirectly benefits Apple Inc. (AAPL) by increasing the utility and adoption of Apple Pay. The overall sentiment is positive, as this partnership can lead to increased transaction volumes and customer satisfaction for Apple Pay users. Given the indirect but positive impact on Apple's ecosystem and the lack of negative implications, there is a moderate to high probability of Apple's stock price rising. Previous predictions from various models show a range of sentiments, from neutral to mildly optimistic, which supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news announcement regarding Synchrony Financial's 'Pay Later' feature integration with Apple Pay is expected to indirectly benefit Apple Inc. by enhancing customer convenience and potentially increasing transaction volumes on the Apple Pay platform. Although the primary focus of the announcement is on Synchrony Financial, the partnership could lead to increased adoption and usage of Apple's payment services. Given the positive sentiments surrounding the announcement and the lack of negative implications, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be moderately high. Considering the indirect nature of the impact and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is lower but still notable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a new 'Pay Later' feature being rolled out by Synchrony Financial (SYF) for Apple Pay users.
