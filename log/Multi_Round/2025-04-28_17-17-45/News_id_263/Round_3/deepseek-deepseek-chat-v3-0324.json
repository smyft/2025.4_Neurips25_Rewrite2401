(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's ruling to uphold a ban on TikTok introduces uncertainty in the social media landscape, potentially benefiting rivals such as Meta and YouTube, which could capture advertising revenue previously directed to TikTok. For Apple, as a platform provider for TikTok, the ban might lead to loss of app downloads and engagement, having a limited negative impact. However, since the ruling creates a competitive edge for rival platforms, it may attract more users and advertisers to Apple's ecosystem over the long term. Overall, the immediate effects of this news lead to an increased chance of downward movement in Apple\u2019s stock due to uncertainties about app sales and the market\u2019s reaction to TikTok\u2019s potential decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple could face penalties if it continues to allow TikTok to be downloaded from its app store, creating a potential downside. However, the article also highlights that an executive order from Trump could delay the enforcement. Furthermore, the article clearly states that the law will trigger the ban on January 19th, provided that TikTok hasn't divested from its parent company. Also, if the sale of TikTok eventually has to occur, because Chinese officials mentioned selling it to Elon Musk, there might actually be a further gain for the company. Based on the combination of these points, the probability of a rise or a fall will come to about the same number.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the ban itself could lead to a decrease in Apple's App Store revenue if TikTok is removed, the news also highlights the potential for significant legal and political uncertainty.  The article mentions that the enforcement of the ban depends on President Trump's actions and the possibility of an executive order delaying the ban or even finding a buyer for TikTok. This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict a definite price movement.  If the ban is immediately enforced and TikTok is removed from the App Store, it could negatively impact Apple's revenue, resulting in a stock price drop. However, if Trump takes actions to postpone the ban, mitigate its impact, or if a sale occurs, it could reduce the negative effect on Apple.  The probability of a price drop is higher in the short-term due to the immediate uncertainty, while the long-term impact is more ambiguous and depends heavily on political and legal developments.  Therefore, a neutral stance on stock price movement in the short-term is more probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face operational challenges if it is required to remove TikTok from its App Store, which could disrupt user experience and potentially lead to backlash. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple indirectly by reducing competition in the social media space, potentially driving more users to Apple's ecosystem or other apps. Additionally, if TikTok is banned, advertising dollars might shift to other platforms, but this is more directly beneficial to companies like Meta (META) rather than Apple. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position, the immediate impact is likely neutral to slightly positive, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about TikTok losing its Supreme Court battle to stop the US ban has implications for Apple's stock price, albeit indirectly. The law that bans TikTok unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary affects companies like Apple, which would be required to remove TikTok from its app store. This could potentially lead to a minor increase in Apple's stock price if investors perceive the company's position as being strengthened due to reduced competition from TikTok. However, the overall impact is likely to be minimal as Apple's business operations and revenue are not significantly dependent on TikTok. The direct beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are likely to be other social media companies like Meta (META), YouTube, and Instagram. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is even lower.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and the Supreme Court's ruling may have an indirect impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL), as the company is mentioned as one of the platforms that would be required to remove TikTok from its app store if the ban takes effect. However, the primary impact of this news would likely be on TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and its potential buyers, such as Meta (META) or YouTube. Since Apple is not directly related to TikTok's business, the news may not significantly affect its stock price. Nevertheless, if the ban leads to increased advertising revenue for Instagram or YouTube, it could potentially benefit Apple's competitors or partners in the tech industry. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news regarding TikTok losing a Supreme Court battle may positively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to the potential redistribution of advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). If TikTok's market share diminishes, competitors like Instagram, YouTube, and potentially others may see increased profits, reflecting positively on Apple through higher revenue streams from these services on the App Store. However, there is uncertainty surrounding Trump's potential interventions and actions, adding volatility. The immediate effects may be more neutral, but long-term benefits to Apple's ecosystem remain probable.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's ruling to uphold the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty for social media dynamics, which could indirectly impact Apple. While the ruling may lead to fewer app downloads and potential revenue loss if TikTok is removed from the App Store, there is a possibility that advertising revenues could shift to platforms like Meta and YouTube, which could strengthen Apple's ecosystem. Mixed sentiments in previous predictions reflect the complex interplay between potential short-term losses and longer-term gains. Given these dynamics, I estimate a slightly higher chance of falling stock prices than rising, with both probabilities being reasonably close due to ongoing political uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, it could lead to a decrease in App Store revenue if TikTok is removed, and Apple might face penalties if it continues to allow TikTok downloads. However, if Trump intervenes and delays or prevents the ban, the negative impact could be mitigated. Moreover, the redistribution of advertising dollars to platforms like Meta and YouTube, accessible through Apple devices, could indirectly benefit Apple. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a neutral to slightly negative impact and others towards a slightly positive one. Considering the uncertainty surrounding the ban and the potential for indirect benefits, I believe the probability of a rise and fall are relatively even, with a slight edge towards a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision on TikTok presents a complex and indirect impact on Apple.  The immediate risk is the potential penalty for Apple if it continues to host TikTok on the App Store. However, the significant uncertainty surrounding President Trump's potential actions (executive order, legislative intervention) creates considerable volatility.  While a TikTok ban could ultimately benefit Apple's competitors (Meta, YouTube) by shifting ad revenue, the direct impact on Apple's revenue is likely minimal, especially considering Apple's diverse revenue streams.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, suggesting market uncertainty.  Given the uncertainty and the possibility of a delayed enforcement or alternative outcomes (sale of TikTok), a neutral stance leans slightly towards a higher probability of no significant price movement. However, a small negative probability is assigned acknowledging the potential for penalties and negative sentiment. The slightly higher probability for no significant change reflects the uncertainty and diverse possible outcomes.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban introduces significant uncertainty in the market, particularly for social media platforms and their stakeholders. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the direct impact is nuanced. While Apple may face operational challenges if required to remove TikTok from its App Store, the broader implications suggest potential benefits. The ban could redistribute advertising dollars to other platforms like Meta, YouTube, and Instagram, which are part of Apple's ecosystem, potentially driving more users and revenue to Apple's services. However, the immediate uncertainty and potential penalties for non-compliance with the ban might weigh on investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals and Apple's diversified revenue streams, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both outcomes remain plausible given the evolving situation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner introduces uncertainty in the social media landscape. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the immediate impact is likely to be minimal but slightly negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from its App Store. However, the long-term effects could be positive as advertising dollars shift to other platforms like Meta (META) and YouTube, potentially benefiting Apple's ecosystem. The probability of a stock price rise is moderate due to the potential long-term benefits, while the probability of a fall is lower due to the minimal direct impact on Apple's revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news regarding TikTok's Supreme Court loss and the subsequent potential ban has mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL), though the direct impacts on AAPL are relatively limited. The potential ban could cause some short-term uncertainty and operational adjustments, such as removing TikTok from the App Store, which could have a minimal negative impact. However, the news suggests a potential redistribution of advertising revenue towards platforms like Meta (META), which may indirectly benefit AAPL through increased activity on the App Store. Given the overall mixed signals provided by previous predictions and the moderate impact anticipated, there is a slight likelihood for both stock price rise and fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's ruling affirming the ban on TikTok introduces a complex landscape for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the immediate negative impact is related to potential revenue loss from the removal of TikTok from its App Store, there is also the possibility of advertising revenue being redistributed to competing platforms such as Meta and YouTube, which can positively affect Apple's ecosystem. Investor sentiment may be weighed down by the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and compliance issues associated with the TikTok ban. Overall, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of falling prices due to immediate concerns compared to the longer-term benefits from increased engagement with Apple-supported platforms.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision on the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Initially, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could lead to a minor negative impact on revenue and user engagement. However, the potential redistribution of advertising dollars to platforms like Meta and YouTube, both accessible via Apple devices, could indirectly benefit Apple by bolstering its ecosystem and increasing traffic to its platforms. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's potential actions adds further complexity. Some previous predictions leaned towards a slightly negative impact, while others were more neutral or slightly positive. Given the combined factors, there's a slightly increased probability that the stock price will fall, influenced by the immediate uncertainty, but the potential benefits prevent a substantial downtrend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision on TikTok creates a complex situation for Apple.  The immediate threat is the potential for penalties if Apple continues to host TikTok on its App Store, should TikTok fail to divest from its Chinese parent company. This could negatively impact Apple's short-term revenue, potentially causing a stock price dip. However, there's substantial uncertainty surrounding President Trump's potential actions. An executive order delaying the ban or finding a buyer for TikTok could mitigate or even eliminate negative impacts. Furthermore, the potential redistribution of TikTok's advertising revenue to competitors like Meta and YouTube, both accessible via Apple devices, could indirectly benefit Apple in the longer term. The previous predictions are quite diverse, reflecting the significant uncertainty.  While a short-term negative effect is plausible, the potential for longer-term positive effects and the significant uncertainty outweigh the immediate negative risk, thereby leaning towards a neutral or slightly positive outcome.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the TikTok ban introduces a mix of potential impacts for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple may face operational challenges if required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially leading to short-term revenue loss and user dissatisfaction. Additionally, there is legal uncertainty surrounding enforcement, which could weigh on investor sentiment. On the positive side, the ban could redistribute advertising dollars to platforms like Meta and YouTube, which are part of Apple's ecosystem, potentially driving long-term benefits. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams and the indirect nature of these impacts, the overall effect is likely to be modest. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the balanced risk-reward scenario, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is estimated to be nearly equal, with a slight edge towards a rise due to potential long-term benefits.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner introduces significant uncertainty in the social media landscape.
