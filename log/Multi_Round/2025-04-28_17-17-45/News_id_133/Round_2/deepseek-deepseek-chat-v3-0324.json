(AAPL)\nNews Headline: BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones\nNews Content: BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT about Apple's market power in relation to eSims and potential competition issues. While these concerns could hint at potential regulatory scrutiny for Apple, the company has shown resilience and maintains a strong market presence. The report did not include any immediate threats to Apple's financial performance and reaffirmed its competitive stance. Overall, the probabilities suggest that while there could be short-term volatility, the long-term outlook remains stable. Thus, I estimate a higher likelihood of stock price stability or slight increase rather than a significant decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a potential future regulatory challenge for Apple due to concerns about its increasing control over the smartphone market through eSIM technology. BT's call for a competition crackdown, along with similar concerns from Virgin Media O2 and Vodafone, indicates that regulatory bodies like the CMA might scrutinize Apple's business practices more closely. Although Apple faces competition, the possibility of further antitrust investigations has a negative effect for investors because antitrust cases represent uncertainty and could hinder Apple's market strategy and create new restrictions. Given the information available for this assessment, 0.3 reflects lower possibility of rise with 0.7 expressing the higher possibility of decline. Apple, in its statement, expresses a willingness to cooperate. This factor is weighed against the potential downside risk associated with the outlined concerns. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: BT's concerns regarding Apple's potential to leverage eSIM technology to gain further control over the mobile market are noteworthy, but unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.  The news highlights a potential long-term regulatory risk, but the CMA investigation doesn't directly address eSIMs, and Apple maintains a strong market position and positive user perception. While the concerns raised could negatively affect Apple's future market share in the long run, the immediate impact on the stock price is expected to be minimal. The probability of a price rise is more likely due to the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple and the lack of immediate tangible negative consequences from this specific news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT about Apple's potential use of its market power to squeeze out mobile networks, particularly through the rise of eSims. This could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential antitrust actions against Apple. However, Apple's strong market position and historical resilience to regulatory pressures suggest that the immediate impact on its stock price might be limited. The news does not directly impact Apple's revenue or profitability in the short term, but it does introduce some uncertainty regarding future regulatory actions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential to use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks, particularly with the rise of eSims. This has led to BT calling for a competition crackdown on Apple. While this news may pose a regulatory risk for Apple, it's unlikely to have an immediate significant impact on the stock price. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's market dominance and diversified business model are likely to mitigate the short-term effects of regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses BT's concerns about Apple's potential stranglehold on the smartphone market due to the rise of eSims, which could allow Apple to tighten its grip on the market and squeeze out mobile networks. However, the article also mentions that analysts consider it unlikely for Apple to launch its own virtual mobile network in the near term. Additionally, Apple's response to the CMA investigation emphasizes its commitment to thriving and dynamic markets. Considering these factors, the news may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased regulatory scrutiny, but the overall effect is likely to be limited. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators regarding Apple's potential increased stranglehold over the smartphone market through eSims. This could potentially impact telecom operators' business models and their relationship with Apple, as eSims would reduce their influence over customers. However, given Apple's strong market position, robust product offerings, and loyal consumer base, it's likely that the overall market sentiment might still remain positive towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news from BT expresses concerns about Apple's market power and potential regulatory scrutiny due to eSims, which could lead to a stronger position for Apple in the smartphone market, potentially undermining telecom operators' business models. However, the immediate impact on Apple's financial performance does not appear significant from this news. Analysts indicate that, while regulatory challenges may pose risks, Apple's strong market position and previous resilience to scrutiny suggest limited immediate effects on its stock. Therefore, the probabilities lean slightly toward a potential rise, giving consideration to the overall market stability and Apple's robust brand perception.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Apple's increasing market power and potential anti-competitive behavior related to eSIM technology. BT's call for a crackdown and similar concerns voiced by Virgin Media O2 and Vodafone suggest that regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase. Previous analysis indicates a mixed sentiment, with opinions varying between a slight positive and a negative impact, depending on whether Apple's resilience can overcome regulatory worries. However, considering the unified complaints from major telecom companies, it is plausible that CMA will launch relative investigation, which can further decrease investors' confidence. Others' predictions are mixed, the mean of 'prediction of stock price rising' is 0.4857 and the mean of 'prediction of stock price falling' is 0.492857, demonstrating a slightly negative trend. Therefore I will slightly increase the probabilities toward the negative side.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators about Apple's potential to leverage eSIM technology to strengthen its market position and potentially displace mobile network operators.  While this raises the possibility of increased regulatory scrutiny and potential future challenges for Apple, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The news doesn't directly affect Apple's current revenue streams or profitability.  The CMA investigation, although not directly addressing eSIMs, adds a layer of uncertainty, but Apple's statement emphasizes its commitment to competition.  Considering the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple, its strong market position, and the lack of immediate tangible negative consequences from this specific news piece, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. The previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 probability of a price rise. I am weighing this against the largely speculative nature of the threat. The concerns are valid, but currently lack concrete evidence of significant, immediate consequences for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns from BT and other telecom operators about Apple's potential to leverage eSim technology to strengthen its market position, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny. However, Apple's strong market dominance, diversified business model, and historical resilience to regulatory pressures suggest that the immediate impact on its stock price might be limited. The news introduces some uncertainty but does not directly affect Apple's short-term revenue or profitability. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, as Apple's overall market sentiment remains positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
