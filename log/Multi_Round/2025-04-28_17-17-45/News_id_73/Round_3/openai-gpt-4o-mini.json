(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has put pressure on AI-driven companies, including major players like Apple. Although DeepSeek's rise could potentially shift investor focus towards European equities, which Citi analysts deem favorable, it raises questions about the massive investments by tech giants in AI. Given that the tech market is currently experiencing volatility and the Nasdaq has shown a decline, there is a higher likelihood of downward pressure on Apple\u2019s stock in the short term. However, the long-term outlook remains stable as the overall growth of AI technology may continue to spur investor interest in the tech sector. Hence, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall in the near term due to the current market sentiment and volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential impact of DeepSeek's emergence on European stocks, suggesting a possible shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech companies, including those reliant on AI hype (like Nvidia). While the news mentions Apple's App Store, the core thesis is about broader market dynamics and sector rotation. The article does not indicate any direct positive or negative impact on Apple; rather, it is an indirect mention. AI capabilities are already established in Apple. Thus, it causes a mild uncertainty, if AI capabilities emerge from smaller players who could be app distributors rather than just big tech companies.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader market, particularly its potential to shift investment away from the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech companies, including Apple.  While DeepSeek's success might lead to some reallocation of investment,  the news doesn't directly impact Apple's fundamentals or business operations. The article highlights potential shifts in investor sentiment towards European equities and away from high-valuation US tech stocks. This indirect relationship means the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  The uncertainty makes a neutral prediction most likely.  A slight downward pressure is possible due to the overall shift in sentiment away from high-growth tech companies, but this effect is expected to be small given Apple\u2019s established market position and diversification.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT on Apple's App Store. This development raises questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm might be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in mega-cap tech companies like Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US tech giants to European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. The news could negatively impact Apple's stock as it hints at potential challenges to its AI-related growth narrative and broader tech sector concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model, and its potential impact on the tech industry and stock market. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it implies that the AI landscape might be shifting, potentially impacting mega-cap tech companies. However, the specific mention of Apple in the context of DeepSeek's App Store performance suggests that Apple's dominance in the AI space could be challenged. The Citi analysts' note focuses on the implications for European stocks and the broader tech market, suggesting a potential shift in investor sentiment towards companies outside the US. Given this context, the news might have a slightly negative impact on AAPL stock as it questions the necessity of massive AI spending plans by mega-cap tech companies, which could include Apple. However, the overall impact seems more aligned with the competitive landscape of AI models rather than a direct hit on Apple's prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese start-up with an AI model that overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT, has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending plans pursued by tech companies like Apple. This development could lead to a decrease in investor enthusiasm for mega-cap tech companies, potentially affecting Apple's stock price. However, the news article primarily focuses on the potential benefits for European stocks rather than directly impacting Apple's stock. The Citi analysts' view that the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the 'Magnificent 7' and the wider European market looks similar, and that European stocks are priced for more reasonable earnings growth expectations, does not directly influence Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the news is more neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it may lead to a broader distribution of investment returns away from mega-cap tech companies.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Given that Apple is not directly addressed in terms of potential business impacts from DeepSeek, and considering the market stability, it's inferred that the news has a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek's AI model puts pressure on larger tech companies, including Apple, as it raises questions about the current high investments in AI and their necessity. The broader implications suggest a potential shift in investor focus towards European equities, which could de-emphasize mega-cap US tech stocks like Apple. Further, market volatility indicated by recent declines in the Nasdaq and Nvidia's significant loss of market value add to this downward sentiment. While Apple's established market position provides some stability, the overall trend in sentiment appears negative, thus suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential shift in investor sentiment away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple due to the rise of DeepSeek and its implications for AI investment strategies. Citi analysts suggest that this could benefit European stocks and broaden the earnings distribution beyond the \"Magnificent 7.\" While not a direct negative hit, the news raises questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by these tech giants, creating uncertainty. Analyzing prior predictions shows a generally bearish sentiment towards Apple, with probabilities of stock price falling ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Considering this sentiment and the news' focus on sector rotation, I predict a slightly bearish outlook but not as strong as previous rounds due the App Store effect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader market impact of DeepSeek's emergence, particularly its potential to shift investment away from US mega-cap tech companies like Apple.  However, the article lacks direct negative news about Apple's performance or prospects.  While the shift in investor sentiment towards European equities is highlighted, it's an indirect influence on Apple. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a slight fall or neutral movement.  The consensus seems to be that Apple's position is relatively secure, but there's some uncertainty given the broader market adjustments. Considering the lack of specific negative news concerning Apple and its established market position, the probability of a significant fall seems lower than a minor dip or stagnation.  The probability of a significant rise also seems unlikely due to the prevalent uncertainty and the overall market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential impact on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. While Apple is mentioned in the context of the App Store where DeepSeek gained popularity, the article does not directly address Apple's business metrics or projections. The broader implications suggest a potential shift in investor focus away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple, which could create slight downward pressure on its stock. However, the impact is likely to be muted given Apple's diversified business and strong market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model that has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT on Apple's App Store. This development raises questions about the necessity of massive AI spending plans by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. While the news does not directly impact Apple's business metrics, it implies potential challenges to its AI-related growth narrative and broader tech sector concerns. The Citi analysts' note suggests a shift in investor focus towards European equities, which could lead to a decrease in investor enthusiasm for mega-cap tech companies like Apple. Considering these factors, the news is more neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it may lead to a broader distribution of investment returns away from mega-cap tech companies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending plans by tech companies like Apple, potentially impacting investor enthusiasm for mega-cap tech companies. However, the news article primarily focuses on the potential benefits for European stocks rather than directly impacting Apple's stock. Considering the indirect relationship between DeepSeek's emergence and Apple's stock, as well as the overall market stability, the news is likely to have a limited direct effect on Apple's stock price. Analyzing previous predictions, there is a trend towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the potential shift in investor sentiment away from US tech giants and the broader tech sector concerns. Therefore, the estimated probabilities are based on the overall analysis of the news and the trend in previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on the broader AI investments and European stock markets. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as the App Store through which DeepSeek gained popularity. However, the news does not specifically focus on Apple's direct business metrics or projections. Instead, it highlights the implications for European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. Although there is some concern about the massive AI spending plans by mega-cap tech companies, the specific implications for Apple are not detailed. Based on the overall sentiment of the previous predictions and the limited direct impact on Apple's operations, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative effect.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek has created a competitive presence in the AI space, which raises concerns about the necessity of massive AI investments by major tech companies like Apple. Analysts suggest a potential shift in investor focus towards European equities, away from mega-cap tech stocks, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Although the news does not directly harm Apple's fundamentals, the overall market sentiment indicates uncertainty and potential downward pressure on its stock. Previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a bearish outlook for Apple, primarily due to shifts in investor sentiment rather than direct business impacts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek and its possible impact on the tech industry, especially how it might shift investor focus from US mega-cap tech companies to European equities. Although Apple is mentioned because DeepSeek's AI model is available on its App Store, the news doesn't have any direct, negative information about Apple itself. Previous predictions lean slightly towards a fall in Apple's stock price, driven by broader concerns around AI investment and sector rotation. However, some models appreciate the App Store effect makes that a lower probability. Given the trend from previous rounds I will slightly adjust my prediction. I will stay with the probability of stock price falling being slightly higher, but slightly less so than in prior rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential shift in investor sentiment away from US mega-cap tech companies towards European equities due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a cheaper and seemingly effective AI model.  While Apple is mentioned (DeepSeek's App Store success), the impact on AAPL is indirect and mostly driven by broader market sentiment.  Previous predictions show a consistently bearish to neutral outlook, with probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  The consensus is that while Apple's fundamental business is strong, the news creates uncertainty related to the future of massive AI investment and potential sector rotation.  This uncertainty, coupled with the generally bearish sentiment reflected by the previous predictions, outweighs any potential positive impact from DeepSeek being hosted on Apple's App Store.  Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, but less pronounced than some of the earlier predictions due to Apple's established market position and diversification.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT on Apple's App Store. This development raises questions about the necessity of massive AI investments by mega-cap tech companies like Apple. While the article primarily discusses the potential shift in investor focus towards European equities, it indirectly impacts Apple by suggesting a broader market adjustment away from the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants. The Nasdaq's recent decline and Nvidia's significant market value loss further underscore the volatility in the tech sector. Given these factors, while Apple's diversified business and strong market position provide some stability, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the potential reallocation of investments and uncertainties around AI spending. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is marginally higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model that has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT on Apple's App Store.
