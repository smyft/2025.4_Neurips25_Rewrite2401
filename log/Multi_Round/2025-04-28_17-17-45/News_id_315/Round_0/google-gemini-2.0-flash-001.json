While the headline doesn't directly reference Apple, the general negativity surrounding 'AI stocks' could create investor concern and potentially a short-term dip.

Negative Analyst predictions in the AI sector always lead to negative movements due to the focus of investors within the AI bubble. Therefore, a slight probability of a fall is expected, though Apple is very reliable, which might mean less of a dip will occur than in smaller companies.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.40,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.60\n}\n```"
