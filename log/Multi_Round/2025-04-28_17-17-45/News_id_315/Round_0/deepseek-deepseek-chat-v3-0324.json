While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as the company in the context, the headline does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of the stocks predicted to drop. However, the mention of 'AI Stocks' could create a negative sentiment around tech and AI-related stocks, including AAPL, due to potential investor concerns. Given the ambiguity and the general negative tone of the headline, there is a possibility of a short-term negative impact on AAPL's stock price. However, without confirmation that AAPL is one of the stocks predicted to drop, the impact may be limited.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
