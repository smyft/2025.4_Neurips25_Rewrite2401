(AAPL). Since AAPL is a well-established tech company with a significant presence in the AI space through initiatives like Siri, Core ML, and more, the mere mention of AI stocks without direct reference to AAPL makes it unlikely that this news will have a significant immediate impact on AAPL's stock price. However, given the negative sentiment around AI stocks in general, there's a slight bias towards a potential fall. But overall, the impact is likely to be minimal as the news is not directly about AAPL.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45,\n}\n```"
