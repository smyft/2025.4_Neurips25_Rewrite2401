      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\nNews Content: 2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks that analysts believe could drop significantly in 2025. However, it does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) directly and focuses on the potential negative outlook for other companies in the AI sector. The lack of direct impact on AAPL could lead to a neutral response, though some market participants might sell AAPL if they are generally bearish on tech stocks due to the mentioned risks. Overall, given that the news does not provide a direct negative outlook on AAPL, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for some AI stocks (although Apple may not be one of the two specifically called out), citing potential drops in value according to certain Wall Street analysts in 2025. While the headline doesn't directly reference Apple, the general negativity surrounding 'AI stocks' could create investor concern and potentially a short-term dip. However, Apple's broad business portfolio (not solely reliant on AI), strong brand, and large investor base often buffer it from broader market anxieties. Negative Analyst predictions in the AI sector always lead to negative movements due to the focus of investors within the AI bubble. Therefore, a slight probability of a fall is expected, though Apple is very reliable, which might mean less of a dip will occur than in smaller companies.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks that analysts predict will drop significantly in 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of those stocks mentioned. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be coincidental and unrelated to the information provided.  We should assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with market trends and general investor sentiment towards Apple, rather than being impacted by this specific news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that certain Wall Street analysts are predicting significant drops in two popular AI stocks, one by 24% and another by 66% in 2025. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as the company in the context, the headline does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of the stocks predicted to drop. However, the mention of 'AI Stocks' could create a negative sentiment around tech and AI-related stocks, including AAPL, due to potential investor concerns. Given the ambiguity and the general negative tone of the headline, there is a possibility of a short-term negative impact on AAPL's stock price. However, without confirmation that AAPL is one of the stocks predicted to drop, the impact may be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that certain Wall Street analysts predict a significant drop in the stock prices of two popular AI stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with estimated declines of 24% and 66% in 2025. This negative sentiment from analysts can impact investor confidence, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, it's essential to note that analyst predictions are not always accurate and can be influenced by various market and economic factors. Given the bearish outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two popular AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The content suggests analysts predicting significant drops for certain AI stocks in 2025, which could create a potential spillover effect impacting market sentiment toward similar tech companies. Since the news is not directly about Apple, it's less likely to have a direct impact on its stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

However, most models agree that the news does not have a direct impact on AAPL. Considering the lack of direct reference to AAPL and the general negativity surrounding AI stocks, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.
