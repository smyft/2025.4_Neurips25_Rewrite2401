      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\nNews Content: 2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks that analysts believe could drop significantly in 2025. However, it does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) directly and focuses on the potential negative outlook for other companies in the AI sector. The lack of direct impact on AAPL could lead to a neutral response, though some market participants might sell AAPL if they are generally bearish on tech stocks due to the mentioned risks. Overall, given that the news does not provide a direct negative outlook on AAPL, I assess a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a negative outlook for some AI stocks (although Apple may not be one of the two specifically called out), citing potential drops in value according to certain Wall Street analysts in 2025. While the headline doesn't directly reference Apple, the general negativity surrounding 'AI stocks' could create investor concern and potentially a short-term dip. However, Apple's broad business portfolio (not solely reliant on AI), strong brand, and large investor base often buffer it from broader market anxieties. Negative Analyst predictions in the AI sector always lead to negative movements due to the focus of investors within the AI bubble. Therefore, a slight probability of a fall is expected, though Apple is very reliable, which might mean less of a dip will occur than in smaller companies.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks that analysts predict will drop significantly in 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of those stocks mentioned. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be coincidental and unrelated to the information provided.  We should assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with market trends and general investor sentiment towards Apple, rather than being impacted by this specific news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that certain Wall Street analysts are predicting significant drops in two popular AI stocks, one by 24% and another by 66% in 2025. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as the company in the context, the headline does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of the stocks predicted to drop. However, the mention of 'AI Stocks' could create a negative sentiment around tech and AI-related stocks, including AAPL, due to potential investor concerns. Given the ambiguity and the general negative tone of the headline, there is a possibility of a short-term negative impact on AAPL's stock price. However, without confirmation that AAPL is one of the stocks predicted to drop, the impact may be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that certain Wall Street analysts predict a significant drop in the stock prices of two popular AI stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with estimated declines of 24% and 66% in 2025. This negative sentiment from analysts can impact investor confidence, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, it's essential to note that analyst predictions are not always accurate and can be influenced by various market and economic factors. Given the bearish outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two popular AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The content suggests analysts predicting significant drops for certain AI stocks in 2025, which could create a potential spillover effect impacting market sentiment toward similar tech companies. Since the news is not directly about Apple, it's less likely to have a direct impact on its stock price movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights potential declines in two popular AI stocks but does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) directly, which means the specific impact on AAPL's stock price is less clear. While the negative sentiment in the AI sector could indirectly affect Apple's stock due to investor concerns, Apple's diversified business model and robust market position provide a buffer against external bearish sentiments. Therefore, while there is a slight chance of a negative impact on AAPL's stock price due to overall market anxiety, the probabilities suggest a more stable outlook for the company's stock price given the lack of direct correlation to the mentioned stocks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline presents a negative outlook for some AI stocks. Although Apple isn't explicitly mentioned as one of the stocks predicted to drop, the general negative sentiment surrounding 'AI stocks,' especially given its push into AI, could create investor concern. Round 0 predictions were mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the trend towards a higher likelihood of price fall among the models' predictions, and incorporating the general unease any negativity brings, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly increased.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the predicted decline of two unnamed AI stocks, not Apple.  While some models suggest a spillover effect could negatively impact Apple due to general market sentiment around AI, this effect is likely to be minimal.  Apple's diversified business model and strong brand make it less vulnerable to sector-specific anxieties compared to companies heavily reliant on AI. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models giving a higher probability to the stock price rising and others favoring a fall. Considering the lack of direct negative news and Apple's overall resilience, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is more appropriate. The wide range of previous predictions highlights the uncertainty, emphasizing the need for a cautious and moderate assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses potential significant drops in two popular AI stocks according to certain Wall Street analysts, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). This suggests that the news is more about general sentiment in the AI sector rather than specific to Apple. Given Apple's diversified business model and strong market position, the direct impact on its stock price is likely limited. However, negative sentiment in the broader AI and tech sector could have a slight spillover effect. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, where some models saw neutral or slightly negative impacts, I lean towards a neutral stance with a slight edge towards a negative sentiment spillover.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two popular AI stocks that certain Wall Street analysts predict will drop significantly in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the headline as one of these stocks. The general negative sentiment around AI stocks could potentially create some investor concern, but Apple's diversified business portfolio and strong brand typically provide a buffer against broader market anxieties. Given that the news does not directly reference Apple, the impact on its stock price is likely to be limited. However, the overall negative tone could slightly increase the probability of a short-term dip. Considering these factors, I assess a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling, but with a cautious outlook due to potential spillover effects from the tech sector.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two popular AI stocks that analysts believe could drop significantly in 2025, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment among the models, with some predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. However, most models agree that the news does not have a direct impact on AAPL. Considering the lack of direct reference to AAPL and the general negativity surrounding AI stocks, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. This is because the negative sentiment in the AI sector could create a spillover effect, impacting investor confidence in tech companies, including AAPL.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news headline discusses potential drops in two popular AI stocks but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Some analysts suggest that such negative sentiments may spill over and impact market perception towards similar tech companies, but without explicit mention of AAPL, the direct impact is limited. The current market standing and resilience of Apple Inc. could mitigate any negative effects from this broader bearish sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
