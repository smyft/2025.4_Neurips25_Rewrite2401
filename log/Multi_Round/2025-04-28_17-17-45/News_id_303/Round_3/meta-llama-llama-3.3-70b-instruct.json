(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market for the company, while competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining traction. Although Apple is expected to grow in non-core markets, the decline in a key region can negatively impact investor sentiment. Furthermore, the overall smartphone market is recovering, but Apple's premium offerings face strong competition, which could lead to concerns among investors. Therefore, the probabilities suggest a higher chance of the stock price falling due to this negative news and market performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market. This is primarily due to increased competition from Huawei and Xiaomi. While Apple is experiencing growth in other markets like Latin America and Africa, the China market is critical. The article also mentions a consumer shift to Apple's premium offerings, which could mitigate some losses. Overall, the negative news from China is likely to put downward pressure on the stock, although growth in other regions and premium product sales may lessen the impact. The global smartphone market is growing, but Apple is losing share in a key market. Given the negative sentiment, it is more likely that the stock price will decline in the short term. However, continued growth is expected in revenue and volume for the Smartphone Market. Also, the news indicates that iPhone captured an 18% Market Share in 2024. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue. Considering that information, I'm estimating slightly negative near future changes to the stock price based solely on this contained analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models in China.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple's dominance in revenue (projected 89-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) suggests resilience.  The Chinese government's subsidies for domestic brands pose a threat, but the increased focus on premium AI-capable phones might benefit Apple in the long run. Considering these mixed signals, a moderate negative impact on the stock price is anticipated, but the overall impact is likely to be relatively small due to Apple's diversified market presence and continued growth in premium segments. The news doesn't represent a catastrophic event for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market, while competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining momentum. This could signal potential revenue challenges for Apple, particularly in China. However, Apple is seeing growth in non-core markets (Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific), and the shift toward premium Pro series devices may offset some declines. Additionally, iPhone revenue is expected to account for a significant portion of Apple's fiscal 2025 revenue (89%-96%). The broader smartphone market is recovering, with global sales up 4% in 2024, and AI-capable devices could drive future growth. Despite the negative headline, Apple's diversification and premium positioning mitigate some risks. The stock was already down 0.54% at the time of the news, reflecting initial market reaction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China has declined in 2024, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple still maintains a substantial market share and is expected to grow in non-core markets. The overall smartphone market is recovering, which could mitigate some negative impacts. Despite this, the immediate reaction to the news might be negative due to concerns about competition and market share erosion.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share has declined in China, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. This decline in market share could potentially negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability. However, the article also mentions that Apple continued to grow in non-core markets and that the company's premium offerings are helping to offset some of the declines. Additionally, the global smartphone market is showing signs of recovery, with sales growing 4% in 2024. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a decline in iPhone market share in China due to strong competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Xiaomi, coupled with the introduction of AI features by competitors. Despite this, Apple continued to perform well in non-core markets. Overall, the news represents a mixed sentiment; while it highlights challenges in a key market, it also shows resilient global performance and growth potential in emerging markets.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's decline in iPhone market share in China poses a significant challenge, especially with increasing competition from Huawei and Xiaomi. Although the overall smartphone market is recovering, and Apple's non-core markets are seeing growth, the loss of share in China is critical due to its size and importance for Apple's revenues. Furthermore, while the company's premium offerings may help mitigate some losses, the immediate sentiment from the market is likely to be negative. Considering these factors and the mixed signals, I predict a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The continuing trend of negative sentiment regarding Apple's performance in China, as shown by the successive rounds of predictions and the initial news, suggests sustained downward pressure. Although there's acknowledgment of growth in non-core markets and premium offerings, the consistent market share decline in a crucial market such as China and the gains of competitors like Huawei are likely to overshadow those positives. The stock's slight dip already reported reinforces this prediction. Given this persistence of negative news and previous model estimates, the probability of the stock falling remains moderately elevated. However, it's also important to balance this with the potential for surprise positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While a decline in Chinese market share is concerning given China's importance, several mitigating factors exist.  Apple's growth in other regions, the shift towards higher-margin Pro models, and projections of strong iPhone revenue contribution to overall fiscal 2025 revenue suggest resilience.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a price fall, but with considerable variance. The overall smartphone market recovery is a positive sign. However, increased competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, aided by potential government subsidies, poses a significant threat.  Considering these factors and the previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the negative impact of the China market share loss, but acknowledging the potential mitigating factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news highlights a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market, due to increased competition from Huawei and Xiaomi. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and revenue expectations. However, Apple's growth in non-core markets (Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific) and the shift toward premium Pro series devices may partially offset these declines. Additionally, the global smartphone market is recovering (4% growth in 2024), and Apple's strong revenue projections (89%-96% from iPhones in fiscal 2025) provide some resilience. The stock was already down 0.54% at the time of the news, reflecting initial market reaction. Considering the mixed signals\u2014negative sentiment from China's market share loss but positive aspects from growth elsewhere and premium product focus\u2014the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market, while competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining traction. However, Apple is experiencing growth in non-core markets like Latin America and Africa. The overall global smartphone market is recovering, with a 4% growth in sales in 2024. Despite the decline in market share in China, Apple's premium offerings and growth in other regions are mitigating factors. The probabilities of stock price movement are estimated based on the negative impact of declining market share in a key region, offset by positive growth in other areas and the company's premium product positioning.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market, due to strong competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Despite this, Apple continued to perform well in non-core markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific, and the company's premium offerings are helping to offset some of the declines.

Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small due to Apple's diversified market presence and continued growth in premium segments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a significant market. This decline, combined with increased competition from companies like Huawei and Xiaomi, presents a negative outlook. However, Apple maintains a solid position globally and in non-core markets. The positive trends in global smartphone market recovery and Apple's premium offerings provide some offsetting support. The probabilities are influenced by these conflicting factors but lean towards a slight negative sentiment, considering historical market reactions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a crucial market, while its competitors Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining traction. Despite growth in non-core markets and strong future revenue contributions from iPhones, the immediate sentiment from market observers is likely to be negative due to the competitive pressure in China. This negative sentiment is reflected in the predictions from multiple models, suggesting a higher probability of stock price decline. Although there are mitigating factors, the overarching trend of market share loss leads to an expectation of downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consistent decline in Apple's market share in China, as highlighted in the news and confirmed by multiple rounds of predictions, is a significant negative indicator. While Apple has shown resilience and growth in other markets and with its premium offerings, the importance of the Chinese market cannot be understated. Competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are gaining ground, further intensifying the pressure. The slight downward trend already observed in the stock price reinforces the expectation of a further decline. Taking into account previous models' estimates and the persistent negative news, the probability of the stock falling remains elevated, although the extent may be mitigated by positive factors such as global smartphone market recovery and potential for surprise positive news in the future.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, given China's size and importance to Apple's revenue. This is exacerbated by the government subsidies favoring domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi.  However, several mitigating factors exist.  Apple is experiencing growth in other regions, particularly Latin America and Africa, demonstrating a diversified market presence.  The shift towards higher-margin Pro models suggests a successful premium strategy, which is further supported by projections of iPhones accounting for 89-96% of Apple's fiscal 2025 revenue. The overall global smartphone market is also recovering.  The consistent downward trend in previous predictions reflects the immediate negative sentiment surrounding the China market share loss.  Balancing the negative impact of China against the positive growth elsewhere and the premium product focus, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher, but not overwhelmingly so.  The previous predictions show a range, with the average leaning towards a price fall, but with considerable variance suggesting uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, a critical market, due to increased competition from Huawei and Xiaomi.
