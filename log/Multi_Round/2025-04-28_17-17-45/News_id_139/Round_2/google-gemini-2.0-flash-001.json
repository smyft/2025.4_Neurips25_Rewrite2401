(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\nNews Content: Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decision by Steven Cohen, a well-known hedge fund manager, who sold his entire stake in Apple, indicating a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects. Coupled with declining market share in China, potential losses in services revenue, and an underwhelming response to AI features, these factors suggest a negative sentiment around Apple's stock. Additionally, the overall valuation appears high relative to earnings growth, reinforcing concerns about potential price declines. While there is some positive sentiment regarding Apple's brand strength, the outweighing negative indicators lead to a higher probability of price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a prominent hedge fund manager (Steven Cohen) sold his stake, signaling a lack of confidence. The article cites declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of revenue from Google's search placement deal, and a lack of traction with new AI features (Apple Intelligence) as significant headwinds. Additionally, the stock's valuation is considered expensive compared to expected earnings growth, which leads the author to suggest investors avoid this stock. All of these points create downward pressure on the stock. On the other hand, Apple is already a well-established company and is probably resistant to the concerns listed in the article. However, given the number and severity of cited negative factors, the overall sentiment is bearish. Hence a higher chance of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Steven Cohen's sale of his Apple stock is bearish, the article highlights several significant headwinds for Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal battle, and the failure of the anticipated AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These factors significantly outweigh Cohen's action, as his sale happened in Q3 and the information given points to continued negative pressures.  The high P/E ratio further supports a bearish outlook.  Conversely, the news is bullish for Axon Enterprise, highlighting its strong financial performance, market leadership, and significant growth potential in a large addressable market, despite a high valuation. However, this analysis focuses solely on Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that billionaire Steven Cohen has sold his entire stake in Apple, indicating a lack of confidence in the stock. Additionally, Apple is facing several headwinds including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of significant services revenue from Google's default search placement deal, and underwhelming consumer response to AI features in iPhones. The stock's current valuation is considered expensive with earnings growth not justifying the price-to-earnings ratio. These factors collectively suggest a negative sentiment towards Apple's stock in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline reveals that billionaire Steven Cohen, a successful hedge fund manager, sold his entire stake in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and bought a small position in Axon Enterprise (AXON), an AI stock that has risen 500% in less than 3 years. This move by Cohen could be perceived as a negative signal for Apple's stock price, as he chose to exit his position in Apple and invest in Axon instead. Additionally, the article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue due to a legal dispute with Google, and the absence of an expected iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features. These factors may contribute to a decrease in Apple's stock price. On the other hand, Axon's strong financial performance, growth prospects, and innovative AI products could justify Cohen's investment decision and potentially lead to a rise in its stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses billionaire Steven Cohen's decision to sell his stake in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and invest in Axon Enterprise (AXON), a company that has seen significant growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The article highlights several challenges facing Apple, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential losses in services revenue, and a lack of an upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features. In contrast, Axon Enterprise has reported solid financial results, has a strong position in the market, and has a long runway for growth. However, the valuation of Axon Enterprise is considered expensive. Based on this analysis, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, while the probability of Axon Enterprise's stock price rising is higher due to its strong growth trajectory and potential for future expansion.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Steven Cohen, a highly successful hedge fund manager, has sold his entire stake in Apple (AAPL), a stock that was his second-largest holding excluding options. This move suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance, particularly given recent challenges the company faces in China and potential regulatory threats. Additionally, Apple's valuation seems high relative to earnings expectations. On the other hand, Cohen has invested in Axon Enterprise (AXON), which has shown robust growth in revenue and earnings. However, Axon's valuation is also quite high. The news focuses more on Cohen's move out of AAPL rather than a shift into AXON.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a clear negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) following Steven Cohen's complete exit from his position, which signals a lack of confidence in the stock's future. The challenges noted, including declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue, and the failure of the anticipated AI upgrade cycle, further contribute to a bearish sentiment. Additionally, the stock's high valuation relative to anticipated earnings growth supports the conclusion that there is greater risk of a price decline. Overall, these factors lead to a strong sentiment against significant upside for AAPL's stock price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds, emphasizing Apple's challenges in China, potential revenue loss, underwhelming AI adoption, and expensive valuation, continues to outweigh any potential positives. Cohen's exit further reinforces this bearish outlook. While not explicitly stated, the persistence of these issues likely offsets minor fluctuations or corrections in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a predominantly bearish outlook for Apple.  The sale of Apple stock by a highly successful hedge fund manager like Steven Cohen is a significant negative signal.  This action, coupled with the numerous headwinds detailed in the article \u2013 declining iPhone sales in China, potential substantial revenue loss from the Google legal battle, underwhelming response to new AI features, and a high P/E ratio relative to expected earnings growth \u2013 strongly suggests a higher likelihood of a price decline. While Apple's brand strength and existing market position provide some level of resilience, the weight of the negative factors and the consensus negative view from previous predictions outweighs any potential positive counterarguments. The previous models' predictions consistently leaned toward a higher probability of a price fall, further reinforcing this assessment. The fact that Cohen's trade happened in Q3 and the negative trends appear to be continuing only strengthens this bearish outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including the sale of Steven Cohen's entire stake, declining iPhone sales in China, potential loss of services revenue from Google's default search placement deal, and an underwhelming response to AI features in iPhones. Additionally, Apple's high valuation relative to earnings growth is a concern. These factors collectively suggest a bearish sentiment for AAPL. While previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, the consensus aligns with the negative outlook presented in the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline reveals that billionaire Steven Cohen, a successful hedge fund manager, sold his entire stake in Apple Inc.

The high P/E ratio of Apple further supports a bearish outlook. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, the overall sentiment is bearish.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a significant reduction in iPhone sales in China, a potential loss of $20 billion in annual services revenue, and a lack of traction surrounding new AI features. These factors, combined with an expensive valuation relative to earnings growth, indicate a pessimistic outlook for the stock. Although Steven Cohen's sell-off signal might be influential, his recent moves are somewhat dated (Q3), and market conditions can change.
