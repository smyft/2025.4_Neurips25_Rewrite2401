A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses various stocks, including Apple Inc., in the context of market performance and stock rankings. Apple's decline of 11.3% year-to-date and its Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggest bearish sentiment. Despite its significant role in the market and consistent performance over the past year (up 15.4%), the current overall stance is negative due to the decline and high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, indicating overvaluation. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is relatively high given the current sentiment and rankings, while the chance of a price rise appears lower given the existing headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple (AAPL) in the context of popular stocks being analyzed by Zacks Investment Research. While Apple is recognized as a Magnificent 7 stock, the analysis highlights negative points: a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a relatively high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article poses the question of whether further declines in the stock would represent a buying opportunity, implying a possibility of further downward movement. Current trends indicate possible further price decrease because of a sell rating with downward momentum noted this year.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Zacks podcast discusses Apple (AAPL) as one of five stocks, noting its recent underperformance (-11.3% YTD, +15.4% over the last year), high P/E ratio (30.1), and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  While the podcast doesn't present new bullish information about Apple, the fact that it's included in a discussion of investor favorites and the question posed ('If Apple falls further, would it be a buying opportunity?') suggests that there might be some sustained interest in the stock. However, the Zacks Rank of 4, indicating a sell rating, and the high P/E ratio suggest that the immediate future outlook is not strongly positive. The analysis also did not include specific factors that might influence price changes, such as upcoming product releases, macroeconomic conditions, or competitive landscape updates. Therefore, based solely on the limited information provided in the podcast, the probability of a price increase is relatively low. The probability of a price fall remains a possibility, however, the podcast's description of the discussion does not indicate anything that would dramatically further decrease the price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a broader podcast episode covering various stocks. AAPL is mentioned as a Magnificent 7 stock with a recent decline in share price (down 11.3% year-to-date) and a relatively high forward P/E ratio of 30.1. The Zacks Rank for AAPL is #4 (Sell), which suggests a negative outlook based on earnings estimates. Given the Sell rating and the high valuation, the market sentiment appears bearish in the short term. However, AAPL's strong brand and historical performance might cushion further declines. The probability of a price rise is lower due to the negative outlook, but the probability of a fall is also moderate given the company's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a podcast episode where the host answers questions about favorite stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The content mentions that Apple's shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, the discussion is neutral and does not provide any directly positive or negative news about Apple's stock. The overall tone suggests a cautious or negative outlook, but it does not seem to introduce new information that would significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated based on the existing trends and rankings.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, but notes that its shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and have a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is not considered a value. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell. However, it's also mentioned that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, which could be a positive factor. Given this mixed information, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is difficult to determine with certainty. However, considering the overall neutral tone of the article and the fact that it's more of a general discussion rather than a breaking news event, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling might be closer to equal. Nevertheless, the slight negative tone regarding the current performance and valuation might slightly lean the probabilities towards a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses multiple companies and their performance, focusing on individual stock questions from listeners. Regarding Apple Inc., the news mentions a decline in stock price year-to-date and classifies it as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Despite its high stock valuation (forward P/E ratio of 30.1), which is not considered a value, the news does not suggest any immediate positive catalysts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news discusses a podcast featuring Apple Inc. (AAPL) among other stocks, highlighting its year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. With a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, the analysis suggests that Apple may be overvalued. Though it remains a part of the Magnificent 7 and has shown resilience, the overall sentiment aligns with negative trends and performance indicators. The lack of positive catalysts and existing concerns over valuation lead to a higher probability of price decline than increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current situation, highlighting negative aspects such as a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a high forward P/E ratio, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The inclusion of Apple in a discussion about \"favorite stocks\" suggests some underlying positive sentiment or continued interest from investors, however, the overriding sentiment is negative. Others' predictions also mostly indicate negative outlooks, with a slight shift towards more neutral in the last round. I considered the consistently bad ranking over the rounds and chose to weigh slightly less negatively due to the fact that it is still in a list of 'favorite' stocks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The provided news is a podcast summary discussing several stocks, including Apple (AAPL).  While Apple is mentioned positively as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and a Warren Buffett holding, the overall sentiment is bearish. Key negative factors include an 11.3% year-to-date decline, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, suggesting overvaluation. The podcast doesn't offer any new positive catalysts for AAPL.  Previous models' predictions show a consistent bearish leaning, with probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Considering this information and the lack of positive news in the podcast, I am assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a rise.  However, the inherent volatility of the market and the potential for unexpected events means neither probability is extreme. The probability assigned leans towards the majority of previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a broader podcast episode covering various stocks. AAPL is mentioned as a Magnificent 7 stock with a recent decline in share price (down 11.3% year-to-date) and a relatively high forward P/E ratio of 30.1. The Zacks Rank for AAPL is #4 (Sell), which suggests a negative outlook based on earnings estimates. While AAPL's strong brand and historical performance might cushion further declines, the immediate sentiment is bearish due to the Sell rating and high valuation. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower, while the probability of a fall is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a podcast episode covering various stocks. Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a negative outlook. The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and a significant holding of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The discussion is neutral and does not provide new bullish information, but it also suggests that if Apple falls further, it might be a buying opportunity. This mixed information leads to a cautious outlook with a slight bias towards a potential fall due to current negative trends and high valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, but notes that its shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and have a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is not considered a value. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell. However, it's also mentioned that Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and one of the pillars of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, which could be a positive factor. Considering the mixed information and the overall neutral tone of the article, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the existing trends and rankings. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative outlook and high valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s performance and current market sentiment. Apple has shown a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and carries a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, alongside a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). These indicators contribute to a generally negative market outlook. However, it is important to note that Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent 7' stocks and its significant role in major investments could bring a level of resilience to negative sentiments. While the recent negative trends remain influential, there isn't substantial evidence in the news suggesting an immediate drastic change in market perception. The previous round of predictions leans toward a higher likelihood of the stock falling, but not without considerations for potential upward adjustments based on underlying company strength.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple's stock in the context of a broader podcast featuring various stocks. Apple's recent performance indicates a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), which points to a generally negative sentiment among analysts. Despite being part of the 'Magnificent 7', its high forward P/E ratio of 30.1 and lack of positive catalysts further contribute to the bearish outlook. While some models predict a slight potential for price rises due to its strong brand and historical performance, the prevailing sentiment leans towards a price decline. Therefore, I am estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling based on the current analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's inclusion in a podcast of popular stocks. While recognized as a 'Magnificent 7' holding, the stock's underperformance is highlighted: -11.3% YTD, high P/E of 30.1 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Despite being a 'favorite,' negative factors weigh on potential upward movement. Previous predictions consistently leaned bearish. Given this sentiment and declining performance, the probability of a fall is higher than a rise. Overall, weighting previous preditions and negative factors from the article, downward price movement is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece is a summary of a podcast discussing several stocks, including Apple. While Apple is mentioned positively as a 'Magnificent 7' company and a Warren Buffett holding,  the overall analysis leans bearish. Key negative factors include a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, suggesting overvaluation.  The podcast doesn't provide any new positive catalysts. Previous model predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the lack of positive news and the prevailing negative sentiment, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall.  However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance might partially mitigate the negative impact. The probabilities reflect a weighting of the negative factors and the consensus of previous predictions, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in stock market prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a podcast episode covering various stocks. Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a negative outlook. The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and a significant holding of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The discussion is neutral and does not provide new bullish information, but it also suggests that if Apple falls further, it might be a buying opportunity. This mixed information leads to a cautious outlook with a slight bias towards a potential fall due to current negative trends and high valuation. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a podcast episode covering various stocks. Apple's stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating a negative outlook. The forward P/E ratio is 30.1, which is considered high. However, Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and a significant holding of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The discussion is neutral and does not provide new bullish information, but it also suggests that if Apple falls further, it might be a buying opportunity. This mixed information leads to a cautious outlook with a slight bias towards a potential fall due to current negative trends and high valuation. Considering the consistent bearish leaning from previous predictions, with probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.5 to 0.7, I estimate the probability of a stock price rise at 0.3 and the probability of a stock price fall at 0.7.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, but notes that its shares have declined 11.3% year-to-date and have a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is not considered a value. Additionally, Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4, or Sell.

Considering the mixed information and the overall neutral tone of the article, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the existing trends and rankings. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative outlook and high valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a broader podcast episode covering various stocks. Apple has experienced a decline of 11.3% year-to-date, holds a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), and has a forward P/E ratio of 30.1, which is considered high. While Apple remains a Magnificent 7 stock and a key asset in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio, the current negative indicators dominate market sentiment, suggesting potential overvaluation and bearish trends. Although the podcast mentions it as a potential buying opportunity if it falls further, the predominant bearish outlook and high P/E ratio suggest a stronger expectation of price decline. Previous predictions show a consistent bias towards falling prices. Given the mixed nature of the news (positive due to fundamental strength, negative due to financial metrics and market sentiment), I lean towards the negative probabilities.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
