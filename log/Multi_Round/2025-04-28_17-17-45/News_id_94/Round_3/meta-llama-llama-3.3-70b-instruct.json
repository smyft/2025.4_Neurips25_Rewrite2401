      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\nNews Content: Over 26% of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in Apple stock, which he has owned since 2016 and is still his largest holding; however, he has sold over 615 million shares of Apple in the past four quarters.\n\nOvervalued and Tax Concerns\n\nApple has traditionally been a high-flying quality stock with a vast moat, an exemplary capital allocation strategy, and a tactical product rollout. Still, the stock has been heavily overvalued since late 2023, with a current value hovering around 20% over GuruFocus's calculated fair market value of $189.29. Furthermore, Buffett's nearly 25% share reduction during September was more likely due to tax considerations. During the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Buffett stated that he expected future tax rates to rise.\n\nTentative with Technology\n\nAnother reason for selling may be that Buffett is less comfortable with technology companies than his late partner, Charlie Munger, as Berkshire started offloading shares shortly after Charlie passed away in November 2023. Before his passing, Munger emphasized the importance of owning stocks like Apple and Alphabet, acknowledging their dominance and consistent outperformance in the market.\n\nDominos Investment\n\nBuffett's Apple sales have generated nearly $25 billion, giving Berkshire Hathaway a large cash pile for other investments. Fifty-five million of that cash has been invested in high-quality Domino's Pizza, representing approximately 3.7% of company shares. This solid-value, non-technology franchise business may appeal more to Buffett than his existing overinflated Apple stock. The stock is trading slightly below Guru Focus's fair market value estimate of $428.28, with an overall score of 92 and a profitability rank of 10 out of 10. Domino's share price is expected to rise approximately 10% in the next 12 months versus Apple's, which is predicted to increase by less than 1%. Domino's fortressing strategy, global master franchise agreements, Pulse POS system, and recently upgraded customer loyalty program have helped the company expand globally and drive domestic carryout traffic. The company is the prominent market leader in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza business and outperformed Papa John's and Pizza Hut (owned by Yum Brands) in 2024. The company has an impressive 56% ROIC, contrasting sharply with a meager 9.95% WACC, suggesting the company is effectively allocating capital and accreting value despite a heavy debt burden.\n\nDomino's debt burden is reflected in the company's long history of negative debt-to-equity and equity-to-asset ratios. However, these metrics align with Papa John's and Yum Brands in this competitive, capital-intensive industry. With its huge cash pile, Berkshire Hathaway's interest in the company may help alleviate investor concerns. Domino's paid investors a $1.51 per share dividend in September and has had a 20% dividend growth rate over the last 10 years. That policy may be questionable, given their negative equity history.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nDPZ Data by GuruFocus\n\nHere's how Domino's metrics currently stack up with competitors (Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Domino's Pizza Inc Yum Brands Inc (Pizza Hut) Papa John's International Inc Symbol DPZ YUM PZZA Industry Restaurants Restaurants Restaurants GF Score 92 87 74 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Wide Narrow Predictability Rank 4/10 1/10 1/10 GF Value Rank 7/10 9/10 4/10 GF Valuation  Fairly Valued Modestly Undervalued Significantly Undervalued Profitability Rank 10/10 9/10 8/10 Financial Strength 4/10 4/10 4/10 Growth Rank 9/10 7/10 5/10 GF Value 429.80 144.33 79.35 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 443.84 0.00 0.00 Price Target 483.07 144.17 57.73 Revenue 4,665.47 7,223.00 2,099.94 PE Ratio 26.27 23.42 12.50 PEG Ratio 2.07 4.36 0.61 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 27.96 28.81 16.89 PB Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.00 PS Ratio 3.22 4.94 0.56 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 30.09 26.10 23.93 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 24.37 21.96 9.69 EV-to-EBITDA 20.00 18.28 8.91 Debt-to-Equity -1.31 -1.46 -2.23 Interest Coverage 4.41 4.74 3.11 Current Ratio 1.71 1.37 0.80 ROIC % 56.18 39.80 15.10 WACC % 10.06 7.66 7.66 Gross Margin % 39.05 48.57 20.25 Operating Margin % 18.49 32.19 6.58 Net Margin % 12.26 21.13 4.51 ROE % Negative Equity Negative Equity Negative Equity ROA % 32.99 24.31 11.02 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate 5.50 13.30 14.10 Dividends per Share (TTM)  5.74 2.62 1.84 Dividend Yield % 1.41 2.14 5.11 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.35 0.51 0.70 FCF Yield % 3.38 3.91 4.20 Buyback Yield % 1.85 0.93 0.00\n\nApple's Short and Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple's stock rose more than 30% in 2024 and is trading at all-time highs. Many fear the stock may lose momentum, as reflected in Guru Focus's flat share price target for the next 12 months. However, Apple investors might not want to unload their stock just yet.\n\nNear-term prospects are mixed due to geopolitical risks related to Apple's supply chain in China and Taiwan. With Trump's return to office, we might see a continuation of his previous trade policies, which previously have included tariffs on Chinese products and stricter enforcement of trade agreements.\n\nApple also has antitrust concerns. Since Google is the default search engine on Safari, Apple has taken an interest in the Department of Justice versus Google case, which may negatively impact Apple's ability to provide premium products to users. Weakened consumer spending may exacerbate these problems.\n\nHowever, the release of the new iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 holds some promise that the stock may maintain a similar 2024 trajectory, including record revenues of 9.4 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase, and a 12% earnings increase. Apple is also developing a proprietary cellular modem, expected to roll out in 2025, starting with the iPhone SE and even eventually moving to premium models by 2027. This vertical integration strategy is expected to drive margin expansion.\n\nWith the adoption of Apple Intelligence, Apple's latest artificial intelligence system, introduced at the company's tradeshow, Worldwide Developers Conference 2024, dedicated Apple users are expected to upgrade their current iPhone models in 2026. The company is also expected to have an 11.4% compounded annual growth rate in service revenue through fiscal year 2027. For these reasons, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 12.3% revenue growth and earnings per share of $8.52 for 2026.\n\nThe Stalwart Parent\n\nCautious investors can't go wrong with Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway shows moderate short-term gain potential with strong financial health and profitability metrics. Net margin, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital indicate strong financial health compared to the S&P 500. The company had a record $325.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 2024, up from $276.9 billion at the end of June 2024. Berkshire Hathaway A and B shares are priced slightly above Guru Focus's calculated values. Investment income trends for the company remain strong due to increased bond reinvestment rates and Berkshire also exhibits attractive long-term prospects due to consistent revenue and net income growth, improved financial health, and a diversified business model. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to earn over $23.00 per share by 2027 through 2029 and may also continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions.\n\nHowever, there are a few cracks in the armor. Operating earnings were $4.68 per share in the third quarter of 2024, a decline due to decreased underwriting income from industrywide catastrophes. The company has a history of rising debt and inconsistent per-share cash flow within the last 5 years.What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nBRK.A Data by GuruFocus\n\nIn November 2024, CFRA downgraded its rating on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares from 'Buy' to 'Hold,' attributing the decision to lower EPS estimates and revenue forecasts caused by widespread declines in operating revenues and insurance premiums.\n\nMorningstar lowered Berkshire Hathaway's moat rating from wide to narrow due to several factors. They observed signs of slippage in the railroad business and increased litigation exposure for the utilities/energy business, which have put downward pressure on excess returns for the noninsurance operations. Moreover, following Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s inevitable departure, the company will likely find it challenging to replicate the historic advantages he provided, making it harder for Berkshire to achieve superior returns consistently over the next decade.\n\nBelow is a comparison of significant metrics for the three main companies discussed in this report (BRK.A & BRK.B refer to the same company but have slightly different metrics due to market fluctuations; Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Apple Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Domino's Pizza Inc Symbol AAPL BRK.A BRK.B DPZ Industry Hardware Insurance Insurance Restaurants GF Score 96 72 69 92 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Narrow Narrow Wide Predictability Rank 5 Stars 1 Star 1 Star 4 Stars GF Value Rank 5/10 5/10 3/10 7/10 GF Valuation Modestly Overvalued Modestly Overvalued Significantly Overvalued Fairly Valued Profitability Rank 10/10 6/10 6/10 10/10 Financial Strength 6/10 7/10 7/10 4/10 Growth Rank 10/10 2/10 2/10 9/10 GF Value 189.76 564,060.75 353.49 429.80 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 144.50 0.00 0.00 443.84 Price Target 243.60 762,340.33 513.00 483.07 Revenue 391,035.00 452,954.00 452,954.00 4,665.47 PE Ratio 37.83 9.47 9.47 26.27 PEG Ratio 2.14 0.00 0.00 2.07 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 34.94 8.78 8.78 27.96 PB Ratio 61.05 1.61 1.61 0.00 PS Ratio 9.07 2.23 2.23 3.22 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 32.60 48.11 48.11 30.09 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 30.00 25.06 25.06 24.37 EV-to-EBITDA 25.99 7.28 7.28 20.00 Debt-to-Equity 1.87 0.20 0.20 -1.31 Interest Coverage N/A 27.47 27.47 4.41 Current Ratio 0.87 0.00 0.00 1.71 ROIC % 32.51 10.65 10.65 56.18 WACC %  11.41 9.07 9.07 10.06 Gross Margin % 46.21 0.00 0.00 39.05 Operating Margin % 31.51 0.00 0.00 18.49 Net Margin % 23.97 23.60 23.60 12.26 ROE %  140.28 18.50 18.50 Negative Equity ROA % 26.93 9.87 9.87 32.99 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate  3.00 25.10 25.10 5.50 Dividends per Share (TTM)  0.98 0.00 0.00 5.74 Dividend Yield % 0.43 0.00 0.00 1.41 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.15 0.00 0.00 0.35 FCF Yield % 3.15 2.08 2.08 3.38 Buyback Yield % 2.75 0.51 0.51 1.85\n\nGiven the current metrics of these three companies, Domino's appears to be the best value investment for those seeking a balance of growth potential and dividend yield. It is fairly valued with a significant expected price increase and offers a high dividend yield. Still, prospective investors should be wary of the company's high debt levels and negative equity.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the clear winner for more risk-averse investors. The company has low PE and EV/EBITDA ratios and a nearly 70% margin of safety based on GuruFocus's discounted cash flow model. Still, these calculations may be highly unpredictable due to the company's narrowing moat, challenges in capital allocation, and inevitable leadership transition.\n\nTake-Aways\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway significantly reduced its Apple holdings, selling over 615 million shares due to concerns about Apple's overvaluation and future tax rates. This shift reflects Buffett's cautious stance on technology stocks following the passing of his partner, Charlie Munger.\n\nThe proceeds from these sales have been partially reinvested in Domino's Pizza, a high-quality, non-technology franchise that aligns more closely with Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\nDespite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds such as decreased underwriting income, rising debt, and a narrowing moat, compounded by the impending leadership transition post-Buffett. Domino's Pizza emerges as a compelling value investment, offering a balance of growth potential and dividend yield despite its high debt levels.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news suggests that Warren Buffett's significant sell-off of Apple shares reflects concerns regarding overvaluation and potential future tax increases, which are likely to cause some investor hesitation. Moreover, geopolitical risks and antitrust issues may add to the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock performance. However, the company has strong recent fundamentals and product offerings that could mitigate the impact of the negative factors. Therefore, the probability of a price decline is assessed to be higher than that of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, Buffett selling a significant portion of his stake due to overvaluation and potential tax implications raises concerns. His preference for Domino's, a non-tech company, further highlights potential reservations about Apple's current valuation. Near-term geopolitical risks and antitrust concerns also weigh on Apple. On the other hand, new product launches (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4), development of a proprietary cellular modem, and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential upside. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue and EPS growth for 2026 also supports a positive outlook. Considering these conflicting factors, the probability of a fall is slightly higher. The analysis indicates both factors pushing the price up and pushing the price down, hence the probability is not extremely one-sided.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant reduction of Apple stock holdings and his investment in Domino's Pizza.  Buffett's sell-off is attributed to Apple's overvaluation, tax concerns, and a potential shift away from technology stocks following the death of Charlie Munger. While Apple's future prospects are mixed due to geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential weakening consumer spending, new product releases offer some hope.  The article also highlights the potential for growth in Apple's services revenue.  In contrast, Domino's is presented as a favorable investment due to its strong financial performance and dividend yield, despite its high debt. Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, shows moderate short-term gain potential but faces challenges such as decreased underwriting income and an impending leadership transition.  Considering Buffett's actions and the mixed outlook for Apple, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, though not overwhelmingly so. The focus is on the reasons for Buffett's selling, which suggests a negative sentiment, rather than any significantly bullish news for Apple. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis considers multiple factors affecting Apple's stock price, including Buffett's significant reduction in holdings, overvaluation concerns, tax considerations, and geopolitical risks. While Apple has strong fundamentals, new product launches, and AI integration, the stock's current overvaluation and Buffett's sell-off indicate potential downside pressure. However, its strong market position and future growth prospects provide some upside potential. The probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight tilt towards a potential fall due to the immediate negative sentiment from Buffett's actions and overvaluation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reducing its Apple holdings by over 615 million shares, citing concerns about Apple's overvaluation and potential future tax rate increases. Despite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. The article also highlights Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Domino's Pizza, which aligns more closely with Buffett's investment philosophy. Given these factors, it seems that the news may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term due to reduced support from a major investor and concerns about overvaluation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reducing its Apple holdings due to concerns about Apple's overvaluation and future tax rates.

Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds such as decreased underwriting income, rising debt, and a narrowing moat, compounded by the impending leadership transition post-Buffett. Domino's Pizza emerges as a compelling value investment, offering a balance of growth potential and dividend yield despite its high debt levels. Considering these factors, I analyzed the situation and estimated the probabilities of the stock prices rising or falling for each company.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges affecting Apple Inc., including overvaluation, geopolitical risks, and increased competition. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also reduced its stake, citing concerns over future tax rates and a shift towards more conservative investments. While Apple has promising product rollouts, the combination of overvaluation and geopolitical uncertainties creates headwinds. These factors suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns about Apple's stock, particularly regarding Warren Buffett's decision to sell a large portion of his shares due to overvaluation and anticipated tax implications. There are geopolitical risks as well as antitrust issues that could further pressure the stock price. While Apple's strong recent performance and upcoming product launches offer some potential for upside, these factors are overshadowed by the negative sentiment stemming from Buffett's actions and the stock's overvaluation. This analysis suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds, highlighting Buffett's sell-off due to overvaluation and tax concerns, continues to outweigh the potential positives of new product releases. While some see potential for revenue growth, the immediate impact of Buffett's reduced stake and the looming geopolitical and antitrust challenges are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the short-term. The slight decrease in the estimated probability of the stock falling, down from the most common .6 to .55, indicates confidence in Apple's capabilities in mitigating these negative impacts, especially due to new product pipelines.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Buffett's significant sale of Apple stock is a major bearish signal, citing overvaluation and tax concerns, Apple's strong 2024 performance and upcoming product releases offer potential for continued growth.  Geopolitical risks and antitrust concerns introduce uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so.  Considering the conflicting factors\u2014a large sell-off versus strong recent performance and future product potential\u2014a slightly higher probability of a price fall is warranted, but not a dramatic one. The overall market sentiment towards tech stocks is also a factor to consider; any broader downturn could amplify the bearish pressure from Buffett's actions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings, citing overvaluation and tax concerns, signals a lack of confidence from a major investor. Additionally, geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential weakening consumer spending add to the downside risks. On the positive side, Apple's strong recent performance, new product launches (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4), and developments in AI and proprietary cellular modem technology provide some upside potential. However, the immediate negative sentiment from Buffett's sell-off and the stock's overvaluation tilt the probabilities towards a potential fall. The previous predictions also predominantly favor a higher probability of a price decline, aligning with this cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to overvaluation concerns and potential future tax rate increases. Despite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. The mixed outlook for Apple, with both positive and negative factors, suggests that the stock's short-term prospects are uncertain. However, considering Buffett's actions and the reasons behind them, along with the company's strong fundamentals and future growth prospects, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling than rising. The recent product launches and AI integration offer some hope for future growth, but they are not enough to outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings due to concerns about overvaluation and potential future tax rate increases. Despite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. The analysis of previous predictions and the article's content suggests a cautious outlook with a slight tilt towards a potential fall due to the immediate negative sentiment from Buffett's actions and overvaluation.

Additionally, the potential geopolitical risks and antitrust issues surrounding Apple create further uncertainty for investors. While Apple's strong product lineup and market position may support its fundamentals, the prevailing sentiment is more negatively skewed due to Buffett's actions and the stock's valuation pressure. Given the previous predictions and the mixed outlook for the company, I assess a higher probability of the stock price falling in the near term than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The recurring theme across both the news article and previous model predictions emphasizes the negative impact of Warren Buffett's significant Apple stock sell-off, primarily driven by overvaluation and potential tax implications. While new product launches and AI integration offer some potential for growth, the overarching sentiment remains bearish. Most predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a fall. There are no strong contrary indications. However, because the article mentions positive outlook on new product lauch, a slightly higher probability of falling is warranted, but not a dramatic one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Buffett's significant share reduction is a major bearish signal, driven by overvaluation concerns, potential tax implications, and a perceived shift away from technology investments.  Geopolitical risks and antitrust concerns further add to the uncertainty. However, strong 2024 performance, upcoming product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4), development of a proprietary cellular modem, and the potential for growth in services revenue offer counterbalancing bullish factors.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the immediate negative impact of Buffett's actions.  While the long-term outlook remains positive due to innovation and strong fundamentals, the short-term impact of the sell-off, overvaluation, and external risks suggests a higher likelihood of a price decline. The consensus leans towards a fall but not dramatically so, reflecting the presence of both bullish and bearish signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings, citing overvaluation and tax concerns, is a strong bearish signal. This action by a major investor like Buffett could lead to negative sentiment among other investors. Additionally, geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential weakening consumer spending add to the downside risks. On the other hand, Apple's strong recent performance, new product launches (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4), and developments in AI and proprietary cellular modem technology provide some upside potential.
