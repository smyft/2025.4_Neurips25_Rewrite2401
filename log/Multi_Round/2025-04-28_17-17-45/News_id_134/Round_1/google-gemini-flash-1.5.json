      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Streaming turned profits in 2024. Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.\nNews Content: For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in profitability for streaming services, particularly highlighting Netflix's significant earnings boost. This improvement could be seen positively by investors, as it reflects a shift toward sustainable profitability in the streaming sector. However, the cautious outlook from analysts regarding continued profitability and the risks associated with customer retention and increased competition could temper enthusiasm for broader media stocks. For Apple, which is not directly involved in the streaming wars but does benefit from overall consumer spending and media consumption trends, the news is somewhat supportive but not conclusive. Therefore, the probabilities for stock price movement are cautiously optimistic for a rise, but with certain risks present. Thus, I estimate a higher probability for a rise in price than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader streaming landscape and its positive trend toward profitability in 2024. While it doesn't directly mention Apple's streaming service (Apple TV+), the overall positive sentiment in the industry is likely to have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock. The article highlights Netflix's success and explores challenges faced by traditional media companies in achieving consistent and significant streaming profits. Therefore, Apple may be indirectly affected by overall trends in the industry, but it is not a main focus considering this analysis. The news does not give a strong directional impetus for Apple's stock, considering, if any, Apple's streaming profits are likely to be small as compared to other ventures by Apple. Therefore, the probability for its stock rising is only slightly higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on the profitability of streaming services in 2024, highlighting the collective success of major players like Netflix, Disney, and others. While this is generally positive, the article also emphasizes significant challenges.  These include maintaining profitability (margins are still low for most except Netflix), combating subscriber churn in the face of price increases, and the competitive landscape.  The uncertainty around the sustainability of this newfound profitability and the potential limitations of growth (both subscriber base and price increases) create a cautious outlook. While the positive news of streaming profits could initially boost Apple's stock (as Apple TV+ is part of their services segment), the overall cautious tone regarding the future of streaming profitability and the article's focus on other companies limits the extent of any positive impact on AAPL. The news is not directly about Apple's performance, making a strong prediction difficult.  Therefore, a slight probability of price increase is assumed, balanced by a higher probability of sideways movement or slight decline due to the overall cautious outlook for the streaming industry, which is a small segment of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant turnaround in the profitability of streaming services for major media companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which has its own streaming service, Apple TV+. The collective profitability of the streaming industry in 2024, after years of losses, is a positive development. However, concerns about sustaining this momentum, potential price increases leading to higher churn rates, and the need for continued scale to maintain profitability introduce uncertainty. Apple's strong ecosystem and brand loyalty may mitigate some of these risks, but the overall competitive landscape and challenges in the streaming industry could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, highlighting Netflix's leadership and the challenges faced by other media companies in achieving sustainable profits. While Netflix's performance is a positive indicator for the industry, the article also mentions concerns about the sustainability of this momentum, increased competition, and potential limits to subscriber growth and price increases. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the article, but as a company with its own streaming service, Apple TV+, it could be indirectly affected by the industry trends. However, given that the news is more directly relevant to Netflix and other media companies, and without specific information about Apple's performance in streaming, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral or mildly positive due to the overall positive trend in the industry.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the profitability of streaming services, with a focus on the major players in the industry, including Netflix, Disney, and Apple's competitor companies. While the article highlights the challenges faced by these companies, it also notes the progress made in achieving profitability. However, the article's tone suggests that the streaming wars are far from over, and the companies' ability to maintain profitability is uncertain. As Apple is not directly mentioned in the article as a major player in the streaming wars, the impact on its stock price is likely to be indirect. Considering the overall market trends and the competitive landscape, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive trend in streaming profits for media giants, including Apple Inc. However, it also notes challenges related to subscriber churn and maintaining profitability. While Apple's involvement in streaming services is relatively newer compared to Netflix or Disney, the overall positive sentiment towards streaming profitability may influence investor confidence positively. Nevertheless, uncertainties around sustainability pose a risk.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
