The headline suggests a general inquiry about the stock's potential rather than announcing a specific event or financial result. Therefore, it's likely that the stock price will remain stable with a slight bias towards a positive outlook due to the general optimism typically associated with such inquiries. However, without specific positive or negative catalysts, the probabilities of a significant rise or fall are relatively balanced but lean slightly towards stability or a minor increase.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.30\n}\n```"
