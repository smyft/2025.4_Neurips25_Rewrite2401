Since it's presenting an analysis rather than a concrete recommendation, it could suggest a neutral sentiment in the market. However, as the largest publicly traded company, Apple generally has robust fundamentals and investor interest. The lack of negative news in the report may lead to a higher probability of price stability or rise versus a fall. Given these factors, I would estimate a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise compared to a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}"
