(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple's current share price of $223 is perceived as undervalued, with an estimated fair value of $279, suggesting a 20% upside potential. Analyst price targets averaging around $246 also support a bullish outlook despite a noted decline in earnings over the past year. Given the positive valuation sentiment and the forecast for annual earnings growth in the next three years, the overall market reaction is likely to be positive. However, the mention of threats regarding slower growth compared to the market could introduce some caution among investors. Overall, there is a stronger inclination for a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a 20% undervaluation based on a DCF analysis. While DCF models have limitations, this analysis, alongside positive earnings growth forecasts for the next 3 years, create a positive sentiment. The report also mentions Apple's debt being well covered and identifies the company as a good value based on P/E ratio and fair value. However, the slower earnings growth forecast compared to the overall American market, and the general caution advised against over-reliance on DCF, tempers exuberance. Although the article highlights both upsides and downsides regarding the stock, I believe that the estimated undervaluation will nudge investors to action which will cause the price to move upward.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a discounted cash flow (DCF) model valuation of Apple Inc., suggesting a 20% undervaluation based on a fair value estimate of US$279 compared to the current share price of US$223.  However, the article also highlights the inherent limitations of DCF models, such as sensitivity to input assumptions (discount rate, growth rates, etc.) and the exclusion of qualitative factors. While the undervaluation claim is compelling, the significant reliance on a single valuation method, along with acknowledged uncertainties, prevents a definitive conclusion. The probability estimates below consider both the positive valuation and the inherent uncertainties associated with DCF models and market reactions. A moderate increase in probability of price rise is assigned due to the valuation, balanced by the acknowledgment of market volatility and other factors not considered in this valuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents an analysis suggesting that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. The DCF model is a widely respected valuation method, and the article highlights that the fair value estimate is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial position, with debt well covered by earnings and cash flows, and forecasts annual earnings growth for the next three years. These factors collectively suggest a positive outlook for Apple's stock price. However, the article also notes some weaknesses, such as declining earnings over the past year and a low dividend compared to peers, which could temper the bullish sentiment. Given the overall positive tone of the analysis and the significant undervaluation indicated by the DCF model, it is reasonable to conclude that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple's stock is undervalued by 20% based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, with an estimated fair value of $279. The article highlights Apple's strong financials, including well-covered debt by earnings and cash flows, and forecasts annual earnings growth for the next three years. However, it also mentions that the dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market and that annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. The overall tone of the article is neutral to positive, suggesting that the stock might be a good value. Given this information, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising as investors may see the current price as an attractive entry point.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a detailed analysis of Apple Inc.'s valuation using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, estimating the company's fair value to be US$279, which is 20% higher than the current share price of US$223. This suggests that the stock may be undervalued. However, it's essential to consider that valuation models have limitations and are not foolproof. The article also mentions that annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years, which could be a positive factor for the stock. Given this information, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential undervaluation and positive earnings growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by around 20% based on a DCF valuation model. The key insight is that the fair value of the stock is estimated at $279, which is higher than the current stock price of $223. Additionally, the company's financials and future growth expectations suggest positive momentum, which supports a higher intrinsic value.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is undervalued by about 20%, with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. This suggests a significant upside potential. The report contains positive factors such as projected annual earnings growth for the next three years and strong financial health, with debt well covered by earnings. However, it also acknowledges potential risks, including a decline in earnings over the past year and a low dividend compared to peers, which may temper investors' enthusiasm. Overall, the sentiment is more positive due to the undervaluation insight, leading to a higher likelihood of a price increase. Thus, I estimate a probability of 0.68 for the stock price to rise, and correspondingly, 0.32 for it to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The consistent undervaluation identified by the DCF model and echoed across multiple analyses in the previous round continues to be the primary driver for a likely increase in stock price. All previous rounds indicated a higher probability of stock price rise. While vulnerabilities like slower-than-market growth and comparative dividend yield exist, the core argument of undervaluation, combined with forecasted earnings growth, appears to be a stronger pull for potential investors. Considering the high consensus estimate from previous rounds, I am maintaining a high probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a DCF analysis suggesting Apple is undervalued by 20%, with a fair value of $279 compared to the current price of $223.  This is a significant positive factor. However, the analysis acknowledges the limitations of DCF models and their sensitivity to input assumptions.  Furthermore, while positive growth is projected, there are also mentions of declining earnings and slower growth compared to the market. The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. Considering the inherent uncertainties of valuation models, the positive valuation, and the generally bullish sentiment from previous models, a moderate-to-high probability of a price rise is assigned. The probability of a price fall is correspondingly low, acknowledging the potential for negative market reactions or unexpected information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news article presents a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggesting that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is undervalued by 20% with a fair value estimate of $279 compared to the current share price of $223. The article highlights Apple's strong financial position, including well-covered debt and positive earnings growth forecasts for the next three years. These factors collectively indicate a bullish outlook. However, the article also notes some weaknesses, such as declining past earnings and slower growth forecasts compared to the broader market, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Considering the overall positive sentiment from the DCF analysis and the supportive financial metrics, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Previous predictions from other models also align with this view, generally favoring a price increase with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The overall tone of the article is positive, highlighting Apple's strong financial position and forecasting annual earnings growth for the next three years. Although there are some noted weaknesses and limitations to the DCF model, the consensus among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential undervaluation and positive earnings growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently undervalued by around 20% based on a DCF valuation model. Multiple models and analysts predict a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, citing the undervaluation and strong financial metrics. While the slow growth relative to the market and some weaknesses pose challenges, the dominant sentiment remains optimistic.
