(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This may signal a more favorable stance towards tech companies in the near future, which can be perceived positively by investors. However, there are potential concerns regarding antimonopoly cases that could affect the stock negatively. Overall, the presence of tech CEOs may lead to optimism about regulatory outcomes, resulting in a higher probability of price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially improving relationship between Apple and the Trump administration, as evidenced by Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. Historically, positive relationships with political leaders have generally been viewed favorably by the market, as it indicates a reduced risk of unfavorable regulations or policies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could present potential risks. Considering these conflicting factors, the projected impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the long-term implications are very dependent on unknown factors. Because of the uncertainty, this effect is likely to be small. The focus of the article is not solely on Apple, which further dampens potential stock movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  While past tensions between Trump and Big Tech existed, this event offers a signal of potential future cooperation or at least a reduction in overt conflict. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which introduces uncertainty.  The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term, given that the news primarily focuses on political relations rather than on company-specific performance or policy changes.  The probability of a price increase is slightly higher due to the positive signal of improved political relations, but the overall impact is expected to be muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential easing of tensions between President Trump and Big Tech, specifically noting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could be perceived as a positive signal for future regulatory relations between Apple and the government, potentially reducing regulatory risks. However, the news does not provide concrete policy changes or immediate impacts, making the effect somewhat speculative. The market might view this as a neutral to slightly positive development, but the overall impact is likely limited given the lack of specifics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. It mentions that Apple CEO Tim Cook attended Trump's inauguration, which could be seen as a positive sign for Apple's relationship with the administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases. Overall, the news seems to be neutral or slightly positive for Apple, as it implies a potential improvement in the company's relationship with the government. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the president. This could potentially lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple and other Big Tech companies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the potential benefits of a positive relationship with the president may outweigh the potential risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, particularly highlighting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This attendance may signal a move toward a more favorable relationship with Apple's administration, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, there are lingering concerns about potential antimonopoly legal challenges facing Big Tech, which creates uncertainty and could counterbalance the positive outlook. Overall, while the indication of improved relations is a positive sign, the lack of immediate policy changes or specific benefits leads to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall, but with only a modest effect expected.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, specifically mentioning Tim Cook's presence at Trump's inauguration as a sign of potentially improved relations. This is generally perceived as a positive signal for Apple, suggesting a reduced risk of adversarial regulations or policies. However, the news also highlights ongoing antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech, introducing a counteracting negative factor. Given the consistently neutral to slightly positive predictions from previous rounds (mostly hovering around 0.55 for a price increase), and considering that no directly impactful company-specific policies or performance metrics are discussed, a slightly positive adjustment seems appropriate, but not significantly altering the overall outlook. Therefore, I'll slightly increase the rise probability based on the consensus of previous model predictions leaning towards a small rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price.  While Tim Cook's presence at Trump's inauguration suggests a potential easing of tensions and a more favorable political climate (potentially reducing regulatory risk), this is a very soft signal with no concrete policy changes mentioned. The ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech remain a significant countervailing risk. The previous models' predictions cluster around a slightly higher probability of a price rise (0.55) than a fall (0.45), reflecting this nuanced situation.  Given the lack of substantial positive or negative news directly impacting Apple's financials or business operations,  I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly towards neutrality, acknowledging the uncertainty and lack of directly Apple-specific information in the news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights an evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration. This could signal a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple, which is generally positive for the stock. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases, which introduce uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. Considering previous predictions, which mostly leaned towards a slight rise (around 0.55), and the lack of strong negative indicators, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, highlighting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This event suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, which could lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the positive signal of improved political relations may outweigh the potential risks. The overall impact is expected to be minimal in the short term, given the lack of specifics on policy changes or immediate impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the president. This could potentially lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple and other Big Tech companies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the potential benefits of a positive relationship with the president may outweigh the potential risks. Considering the previous predictions, the majority of models estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65, with the average being around 0.58. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.58, and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.42.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending his inauguration. This event might suggest a more favorable stance towards Apple and other tech companies from the Trump administration, which could have a positive impact on stock prices. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges such as antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. Based on the provided previous predictions and considering the mixed signals, it is evident that the overall impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. Hence, while positive sentiments from improved relations may influence investor confidence, these could be offset by potential regulatory risks.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news indicates a potentially improving relationship between Apple, as represented by CEO Tim Cook, and the Trump administration, inferred from Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This attendance could be interpreted by the market as a sign of reduced regulatory risks for Apple, which may boost investor sentiment. However, the mention of ongoing antimonopoly legal challenges for Big Tech introduces uncertainty, which tempers the overall positive outlook. Given the mixed signals, my prediction leans towards a modest increase in probability for the stock price to rise due to the favorable relationship being cultivated, despite the potential risks highlighted.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, specifically Apple. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration signals a potential for improved relations, which is generally viewed positively by the market as it reduces regulatory risk. However, the news also mentions ongoing antitrust scrutiny, a negative countervailing force. Previous rounds of predictions have consistently hovered around a slightly positive outlook (0.55-0.65 range for price increase), indicating a consensus view that the news is mildly positive. Given the lack of fundamentally game-changing information, and the fact that much of the content is forward looking and not directly impacting balance sheets, I'm sticking with a slight upward bias, acknowledging that this article alone isn't enough to drastically shift investor sentiment. Also, I am slightly discounting the previous round's predictions since they are mostly converging towards 0.55, which, based on my analysis, appears to be anchoring. The article is more of a \"wait and see\" narrative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price, offering weak signals in both directions.  Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggests a potential improvement in relations, which could reduce regulatory risk and be viewed positively by investors. However, this is a soft signal with no concrete policy changes mentioned.  The ongoing antitrust investigations represent a significant countervailing risk.  The previous models' predictions are relatively consistent, clustering around 0.55 probability of a price rise.  Considering the lack of strong positive or negative news directly affecting Apple's financials or business operations, and given the overall consensus of previous predictions, I am maintaining a relatively neutral stance. The slight upward trend in the predictions across rounds suggests a cautious optimism, but the lack of substantial news warrants a prediction close to even odds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential easing of tensions between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, which could signal improved relations and a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges, such as antimonopoly cases, which introduce uncertainty. Previous predictions from other models generally lean towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise (around 0.55-0.58) due to the positive signal of improved political relations, but the overall impact is expected to be modest given the lack of concrete policy changes. Balancing these factors, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, highlighting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This event suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, which could lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which mostly leaned towards a slight rise, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling. The overall impact is expected to be minimal in the short term, given the lack of specifics on policy changes or immediate impacts.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending his inauguration. This event might suggest a more favorable stance towards Apple and other tech companies from the Trump administration, which could have a positive impact on stock prices. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges such as antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. Previous predictions from various models indicate a slight bias towards a stock price rise, with probabilities largely clustering around 0.55 to 0.60. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly above the probability of a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
