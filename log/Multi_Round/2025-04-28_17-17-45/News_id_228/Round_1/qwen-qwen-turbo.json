(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the evolving relationship between Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This may signal a more favorable stance towards tech companies in the near future, which can be perceived positively by investors. However, there are potential concerns regarding antimonopoly cases that could affect the stock negatively. Overall, the presence of tech CEOs may lead to optimism about regulatory outcomes, resulting in a higher probability of price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially improving relationship between Apple and the Trump administration, as evidenced by Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. Historically, positive relationships with political leaders have generally been viewed favorably by the market, as it indicates a reduced risk of unfavorable regulations or policies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could present potential risks. Considering these conflicting factors, the projected impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the long-term implications are very dependent on unknown factors. Because of the uncertainty, this effect is likely to be small. The focus of the article is not solely on Apple, which further dampens potential stock movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  While past tensions between Trump and Big Tech existed, this event offers a signal of potential future cooperation or at least a reduction in overt conflict. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which introduces uncertainty.  The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term, given that the news primarily focuses on political relations rather than on company-specific performance or policy changes.  The probability of a price increase is slightly higher due to the positive signal of improved political relations, but the overall impact is expected to be muted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential easing of tensions between President Trump and Big Tech, specifically noting Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This could be perceived as a positive signal for future regulatory relations between Apple and the government, potentially reducing regulatory risks. However, the news does not provide concrete policy changes or immediate impacts, making the effect somewhat speculative. The market might view this as a neutral to slightly positive development, but the overall impact is likely limited given the lack of specifics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. It mentions that Apple CEO Tim Cook attended Trump's inauguration, which could be seen as a positive sign for Apple's relationship with the administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases. Overall, the news seems to be neutral or slightly positive for Apple, as it implies a potential improvement in the company's relationship with the government. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the president. This could potentially lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple and other Big Tech companies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the potential benefits of a positive relationship with the president may outweigh the potential risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
