(AAPL). However, as Apple is also a major player in the tech industry and has its own interests in AI, any significant advancements or market movements by competitors could indirectly influence investor perceptions of Apple's competitive standing. Since the news does not directly impact Apple's current product lineup, services, or financials, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Yet, given the competitive nature of the tech industry, especially in emerging technologies like AI, there could be a slight negative perception if investors believe Apple is not keeping pace with innovations in AI. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is low, while the probability of it falling is slightly higher but still not significantly high due to the indirect nature of the news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```"
