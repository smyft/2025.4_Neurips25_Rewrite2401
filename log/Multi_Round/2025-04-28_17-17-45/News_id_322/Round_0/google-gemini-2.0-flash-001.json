While xAI's move signifies increasing competition in the generative AI space, Apple isn't directly competing with standalone AI app developers like xAI, OpenAI, or Google at this moment, but utilizes AI technology within its existing device and software ecosystems.. Therefore, there's no immediate threat to Apple's revenue or market share. However, growing broader concerns regarding the AI race may also be seen as indirectly increasing interest in technology companies, and may boost apple's stock slightly. This reasoning is based on the limited news provided, broader tech sector trends, and assuming a lack of unforeseen details or reactions.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```"
