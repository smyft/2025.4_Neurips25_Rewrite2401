(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi's latest congressional trading disclosure reveals new bets on tech giants Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while offloading Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nAccording to the filing, Pelosi purchased 50 call options on Alphabet and Amazon with a $150 strike price and a Jan. 16, 2026, expiration date, each worth between $250,001 and $500,000. The trades took place on Jan. 14, 2025. Meanwhile, she sold 31,600 Apple shares on Dec. 31, 2024, in a transaction valued between $5M and $25M. On the same day, she sold 10,000 Nvidia shares, worth $1M to $5M, but also purchased Nvidia shares worth up to $500,000 on Jan. 14, 2025.\n\nBeyond big tech, Pelosi added Palo Alto Networks (PANW) shares worth up to $5M, Tempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) shares worth up to $100,000, and Vistra (NYSE:VST) shares worth up to $1M. At 84, Pelosi remains an active market participant, continuing to adjust her portfolio amid shifting economic and tech trends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's decision to sell a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) valued between $5M to $25M may be perceived negatively by the market, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. This could lead investors to follow suit, increasing the probability of a price decline. Additionally, her investment in other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon may shift investor sentiment away from Apple. Given that there are warning signs with Amazon, this may cause some cautious optimism about Apple's comparative stability. However, the direct action of selling Apple shares weighs heavily, leading to a higher probability of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: This news article primarily focuses on Nancy Pelosi's stock trades. While her trades are often followed by investors, it's difficult to directly correlate them with immediate stock price movements. Pelosi selling Apple shares could be interpreted negatively by some investors, potentially leading to a slight decrease in price. Her purchase of Alphabet and Amazon calls could be seen more optimistically for those stocks. However, the market impact of this news depends on how many other high-profile investors follow her trades. In the short term, I believe the small potential psychological fear of the sale leads to a slight dip on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares is the key piece of information regarding AAPL.  While her trades don't necessarily predict market movements, the fact that a prominent figure is selling a significant amount of Apple stock could be interpreted negatively by some investors. This could trigger some selling pressure.  However,  Pelosi's actions are only one data point, and her decision could be based on personal investment strategy unrelated to any fundamental change in Apple's prospects.  The weight of this single event is considerably light against Apple's overall market performance and future predictions., considering the magnitude of Apple as a company, the impact of this news is likely to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi, a notable investor due to her political position and historical investment success, has sold a significant portion of her Apple shares (31,600 shares valued between $5M and $25M). This large-scale divestment may signal a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance or broader market trends affecting the tech sector. While Pelosi's trades are not always predictive, her moves are closely watched and could influence market sentiment. Given the size of the sale and the potential for negative sentiment, there is a higher probability of a short-term price decline for Apple's stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent congressional trading disclosure shows that she sold 31,600 Apple shares, which could be perceived as a negative signal by investors. This sale, valued between $5M and $25M, suggests a potential loss of confidence in Apple's stock. While Pelosi's actions do not directly influence the stock's performance, her trades are closely watched and can impact market sentiment. The news does not provide any direct positive indicators for Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on this information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's decision to sell Apple shares and buy call options on other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon may indicate a shift in her investment strategy, potentially due to her outlook on the companies' future performance. This news could influence investor sentiment, with some perceiving Apple as less favorable compared to other tech companies. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's trades, while notable, are just one aspect of the broad market and economic trends. The sale of Apple shares and purchase of call options on competitors might slightly negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term due to perceived lack of confidence. Nonetheless, Apple's fundamental strengths, market position, and long-term growth prospects should mitigate significant negative impacts.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent trades indicate a shift in her investment strategy, selling Apple shares and buying call options on Alphabet and Amazon. This suggests a negative outlook on Apple and positive outlook on Alphabet and Amazon. Since Pelosi is known for making informed decisions, such actions might influence the public sentiment and market perception, thereby affecting Apple's stock price. However, it's important to note that individual trades do not always translate directly into stock price movements, and many other factors can influence\u80a1\u4ef7\u7684\u4e0a\u6da8\u6216\u4e0b\u8dcc\u7684\u6982\u7387\u53d7\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e02\u573a\u6574\u4f53\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u516c\u53f8\u4e1a\u7ee9\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u60c5\u7eea\u7b49\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u60a8\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u7740\u91cd\u4e8e Pelosi \u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1 Pelosi \u5bf9\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u51cf\u6301\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8d1f\u9762\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8d70\u5411\u8fd8\u4f1a\u53d7\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u91cd\u56e0\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's decision to sell a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) is a major signal that can negatively impact investor sentiment. The size of the sale, valued between $5M to $25M, suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. Furthermore, her investments in competitor stocks like Alphabet and Amazon could shift attention and resources away from Apple. Although Pelosi's trades are not definitive predictors of market movements, they tend to be closely monitored by investors, potentially leading to a short-term price decline for Apple. While some investors might still be optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects, the immediate reaction to such news is likely to be negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The key factor is Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, which continues to be interpreted as a negative signal. While Apple is a large and stable company, Pelosi's transactions still carry weight due to her perceived investment acumen. Past predictions have consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a fall. I will slightly reduce the probability of a stock price falling because it's unlikely that there will be continuous fluctuations. Furthermore, while people may observe Pelosi's behavior, there are also other market participators that believe in investmenting in Apple. Thus the prediction for stock price falling should shrink.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a substantial number of Apple shares is the dominant factor in this news. While her trades don't guarantee market movement, the action itself carries significant weight given her public profile.  The previous predictions largely agree on a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  The size of the sale (31,600 shares, $5M-$25M) is noteworthy and could trigger some selling pressure from investors who follow her trades or interpret it as a negative signal about Apple's prospects.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge that this is just one data point, and Apple's overall performance and market position are much larger factors.  The fact that her purchases are concentrated in other tech companies doesn't inherently strengthen the case for an Apple price drop, but it does add a layer of perceived comparative negativity.  Considering the consensus of previous models and the scale of Pelosi's sale, a slight downward price movement is more probable in the short term, though the impact is likely to be relatively small compared to other market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) valued between $5M to $25M is a notable event that could be perceived negatively by the market, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. This action, combined with her investments in other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon, may shift investor sentiment away from Apple. While Pelosi's trades are not always predictive, they are closely watched and can influence market sentiment. Given the size of the sale and the potential for negative sentiment, there is a higher probability of a short-term price decline for Apple's stock. However, Apple's strong market position and fundamentals may mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of 31,600 Apple shares valued between $5M and $25M may be perceived negatively by the market, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. This could lead investors to follow suit, increasing the probability of a price decline. However, the impact of her trades on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal given the company's overall market performance and future predictions. The purchase of call options on Alphabet and Amazon suggests a positive outlook on those companies, which might comparatively disadvantage Apple in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Nancy Pelosi's recent trades, where she sold a significant number of Apple shares and invested in call options on Alphabet and Amazon. This move could be perceived as a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance, potentially leading to a negative impact on the stock price. However, it's essential to consider that individual trades do not always translate directly into stock price movements, and many other factors can influence the actual price trend. Given the provided predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, and considering the potential negative sentiment resulting from Pelosi's sale, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious outlook on Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent sale of 31,600 Apple shares, representing a significant value between $5M and $25M, may signal a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. Multiple predictions from different models suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily attributing to Pelosi's trades and her shift towards investing in other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon. Although Pelosi's actions are just one factor among many influencing the stock market, the consistent pattern of negative signals from other models indicates a cautionary trend in investor sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's decision to sell a significant amount of Apple shares (31,600 shares valued between $5M and $25M) is likely to be interpreted negatively by the market, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. Given Pelosi's stature as a prominent investor, her trades tend to influence market sentiment. Additionally, her shift towards investing in competitors like Alphabet and Amazon may further detract from confidence in Apple. Despite the company's strong fundamentals and market position, the immediate reaction to such a high-profile divestment is likely to result in downward pressure on the stock. Consistent predictions from previous models indicate a higher likelihood of price decline, reinforcing the cautious sentiment among investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a substantial amount of Apple shares continues to be the primary driver for a negative sentiment. While Apple is a large cap stock, Pelosi's actions still influence market perception due to her public profile. Previous predictions overwhelmingly suggest a higher probability of a price decline. Given that this is the second round of predictions, the effect of her actions might be slightly discounted as the news is already somewhat priced in. Also, Apple's fundamentals remain strong, which provides some support against a significant price drop. Overall, I will predict that the stock price falling is slightly less than the last round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nancy Pelosi selling a substantial number of Apple shares. While her trades don't directly predict market movements, her actions are closely watched and can influence investor sentiment.  The sale could be interpreted negatively, potentially leading to selling pressure.  However, Apple's size and overall market position mean the impact is likely to be limited. The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 in the first round and slightly improving (0.6-0.65) in the second round, suggesting that the initial negative sentiment is somewhat tempered by subsequent analysis. Considering the consensus,  Apple's fundamental strength, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock price movements based on a single individual's trades, I've set the probabilities slightly higher for a price fall than a price rise but acknowledge substantial uncertainty.  The probabilities reflect a cautious approach, reflecting the consensus while accounting for the mitigating factors of Apple's overall market strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) valued between $5M and $25M is a notable event that could be perceived negatively by the market, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance.

Her simultaneous investment in call options on Alphabet and Amazon indicates a shift in her investment strategy, potentially favoring other tech giants over Apple.
