      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: AI in Earnings Calls: How the Largest Companies Are Talking About Generative AI\nNews Content: How do Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon frame their AI narratives?\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on how major companies, including Apple, discuss generative AI in their earnings calls. This indicates a positive trend towards technological advancements and innovation, particularly in AI. Apple has been investing in AI technologies, which could convey confidence to investors about future growth potential. Given that AI is a hot topic and central to many market discussions, it is likely that positive narratives will buoy investor sentiment, leading to an increased probability of stock price rise. However, there is also a risk of volatility in the tech sector, especially if competing narratives from other companies in the same article are divergent or negative. Thus, while there's a strong likelihood of a price increase, a smaller chance of decline exists as well, but it is less probable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on how major tech companies, including Apple, are discussing generative AI in their earnings calls. While the headline mentions Apple, it's more of a comparative analysis across several tech giants. The impact on Apple's stock is less direct than if the news was solely focused on Apple's specific AI initiatives or breakthroughs or failures. A general discussion of AI, even positive, across the industry provides only a moderate boost, if any, to Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities of rise or fall should be relatively close, with a slight lean towards a rise due to the general hype around AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple in a group of companies discussing their AI strategies.  However, the content is vague, offering no specific details about Apple's AI plans or performance. This lack of specific information makes it difficult to assess the direct impact on Apple's stock price.  While positive AI developments generally have a positive market sentiment and Apple is a large tech company with expectations for AI development, the news itself is not directional enough for a strong prediction. Therefore, we assume the impact is minimal and the probabilities will likely remain close to neutral, reflecting the market's broader movements rather than a direct effect from this general news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. Given Apple's strong brand and history of innovation, any positive discussion around AI could be seen as a bullish signal by investors. However, the content is somewhat vague and does not provide specific details about Apple's AI advancements or financial impacts. Therefore, while the news might generate mild optimism, it is unlikely to cause significant price movement. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment implied by the headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple, are talking about generative AI in their earnings calls. This indicates that Apple is actively engaged with AI technology, which can be seen as a positive factor for the company's future growth and innovation. However, the news does not provide specific new information about Apple's financial performance, product launches, or major announcements that would directly impact the stock price. Therefore, the neutral to slightly positive sentiment around AI involvement might lead to a slight increase in stock price, but the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives. Since the article does not contain any negative or critical information about Apple, and instead highlights the company's involvement in AI, a potentially positive and growing field, it could be perceived as neutral to positive for Apple's stock. The mention of Apple alongside other large, innovative companies may also contribute to a positive perception. However, the article does not provide any groundbreaking or unexpected positive news that would significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the general positive sentiment but lack of specific, impactful news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives during earnings calls. Although the content is vague and lacks specific details about Apple's initiatives, the involvement of a renowned company like Apple in the relevant field of generative AI presents a mildly positive signal for investors. The overall market sentiment towards AI technology remains robust, which is likely to provide a slight upward pressure on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of negative information and the general positive connotation of AI discussions in the tech sector, the probabilities lean towards a small increase in stock price, while there is still some risk for a fall due to market volatility and the lack of specific news impacting Apple directly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a focus on how Apple and other tech giants are discussing AI in their earnings calls. This suggests that AI is a key narrative being pushed by these companies. Given Apple's substantial resources and market capitalization, news highlighting their involvement in AI is generally perceived positively by investors as a signal of future growth and innovation. However, the impact of the news is likely to be moderate; it does not specify the details of Apple\u2019s AI strategies or recent achievements, but rather places Apple in the context of trends that involve numerous other tech giants. Considering the previous round estimations, the models predict a slightly positive impact with a range of 0.55 - 0.65 probability of stock price rise. There were no extreme high or low estimates, which indicates that there is no additional information about Apple\u2019s stock. Taking into consideration the slightly positive consensus and the nature of the news headline, there is a likely positive impact on the stock, but due to the news' nature of discussing broader AI trends, this impact is not drastically high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline is general, mentioning Apple among several tech giants discussing AI in earnings calls.  This lacks specific information about Apple's AI strategies or performance. While a generally positive sentiment around AI might slightly favor a price increase, the lack of Apple-specific details significantly limits the impact. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a rise (around 0.55) but with considerable uncertainty reflected in probabilities close to 0.5.  Considering this lack of specific news and the existing range of predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The overall market sentiment towards AI and Apple's general standing will likely have a far greater impact than this news item alone.  Therefore, I am assigning probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. While this indicates Apple's active engagement in AI, a growing and positively perceived field, the content lacks specific details about Apple's AI advancements or financial impacts. Previous predictions from multiple models suggest a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, with probabilities of stock price rise and fall being closely balanced around 0.55 and 0.45, respectively. Given the general hype around AI and Apple's strong brand, there is a mild optimism that could lead to a slight increase in stock price. However, the lack of concrete news limits the potential for significant movement. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to reflect this neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. This indicates that Apple is actively engaged with AI technology, which can be seen as a positive factor for the company's future growth and innovation. However, the news does not provide specific new information about Apple's financial performance, product launches, or major announcements that would directly impact the stock price. The general positive sentiment around AI involvement might lead to a slight increase in stock price, but the impact is likely to be limited. Based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in their earnings calls. This indicates a positive trend towards technological advancements and innovation, particularly in AI. However, the content is somewhat vague and does not provide specific details about Apple's AI advancements or financial impacts. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a range of probabilities but generally leaned towards a slight increase in stock price due to the positive sentiment around AI, I will estimate the probabilities based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment implied by the headline. Given that there is no negative information and the involvement in AI is seen as a positive factor, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives during earnings calls. This indicates broad industry trends and a general engagement with AI technology, which can be viewed positively. However, the news lacks specific details about Apple's AI progress, strategic moves, or any concrete achievements that directly influence its stock price. Given the consistency in previous predictions of a slight lean towards a positive outlook but with minimal direct impact, it is reasonable to maintain a similar stance. Investors' reactions may be tepid, driven primarily by the general trend in the tech sector's interest in AI rather than firm-specific data.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their narratives around generative AI in earnings calls. While the article highlights Apple's involvement, it lacks specific details regarding Apple's unique AI advancements or performance indicators. Nevertheless, given the overall positive market sentiment regarding AI initiatives and Apple's reputation as an innovation leader, it is reasonable to forecast a slight upward trend in its stock price. Most previous predictions indicate a consensus leaning towards a slight increase, but the absence of concrete news limits the potential for significant movement. Therefore, I estimate the probabilities of rising and falling based on this analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Apple's discussion of AI in earnings calls, which is generally perceived as positive due to the current market hype around AI. However, the news lacks specifics about Apple's AI initiatives or financial impact, thus limiting the potential for significant stock movement. Previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a slight increase in stock price, with probabilities ranging from 0.52 to 0.6 for a rise and 0.4 to 0.48 for a fall. Given this consensus and the absence of negative information, I will maintain a slightly positive outlook. However, considering that the information is not specific about Apple, I will adjust my prediction to be a little less positive than the average of the other models' predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news is a general overview of how several major tech companies, including Apple, are discussing AI in their earnings calls.  This lacks specific information about Apple's AI strategy or results. While the overall sentiment around AI is positive, the impact on Apple's stock price from this general news is likely to be minimal.  The majority of previous predictions show a slight bias towards a stock price increase (around 0.55-0.6), but with significant uncertainty reflected in probabilities close to 0.5. This suggests that the market's reaction will likely be muted. The lack of concrete, Apple-specific news means the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. Considering the consensus and the vague nature of the news, I am assigning probabilities closer to neutral but slightly favoring a rise, reflecting the persistent, though weak, positive sentiment surrounding AI in the tech sector and Apple's established position within it.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls. While this indicates Apple's involvement in AI, a positively perceived field, the content lacks specific details about Apple's AI advancements or financial impacts. Previous predictions from multiple models suggest a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, with probabilities of stock price rise and fall being closely balanced around 0.55 and 0.45, respectively. Given the general hype around AI and Apple's strong brand, there is mild optimism that could lead to a slight increase in stock price. However, the lack of concrete news limits the potential for significant movement. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to reflect this neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls.

While the content is vague and lacks specific details about Apple's AI initiatives or breakthroughs, the involvement of a renowned company like Apple in the relevant field of generative AI presents a mildly positive signal for investors. The overall market sentiment towards AI technology remains robust, which is likely to provide a slight upward pressure on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of negative information and the general positive connotation of AI discussions in the tech sector, the probabilities lean towards a small increase in stock price, while there is still some risk for a fall due to market volatility and the lack of specific news impacting Apple directly. Considering the previous predictions from multiple models, which showed a range of probabilities but generally leaned towards a slight increase in stock price due to the positive sentiment around AI, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls, indicating a positive trend towards technological advancements and innovation, particularly in AI. However, the content lacks specific details about Apple's AI advancements or financial impacts. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which generally leaned towards a slight increase in stock price due to the positive sentiment around AI, I estimate the probabilities based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment implied by the headline. The general hype around AI and Apple's strong brand contribute to a mild optimism, but the lack of concrete news limits the potential for significant movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news discusses how major companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives during earnings calls. This indicates broad industry trends and a general engagement with AI technology, which can be viewed positively. The news lacks specific details about Apple's AI progress or any concrete achievements that directly influence its stock price. Given the consistent previous predictions from other models showing a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, the probabilities are estimated to reflect ongoing market optimism for tech stocks with a slight lean towards a positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news discusses how Apple, along with other major tech companies, is framing their narratives around generative AI in earnings calls. Although the content lacks specific details about Apple's individual AI initiatives, the overall sentiment towards AI in the tech sector is positive. Previous predictions from multiple models have generally indicated a slight bias towards an increase in Apple's stock price, reflecting optimism about the company's engagement with AI technology. Given Apple's status as an innovation leader and the continuing interest in AI, I project a modest increase in stock price probabilities. However, the absence of concrete developments or specific metrics about Apple's performance limits the potential for a substantial move, resulting in a conservative estimate leaning slightly positive.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple, among other tech giants, is discussing AI in their earnings calls. This suggests a general trend toward AI adoption in major tech companies, which usually generates market optimism. However, the news lacks specific details about Apple's AI initiatives or financial impact. Previous models' predictions have consistently shown a slight positive sentiment, with the probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.52 to 0.65. Given the consistency in these predictions and the absence of negative details about Apple particularly on AI efforts, I lean towards a slightly positive outlook, but I will constrain the prediction to be in line with the latest round predictions which are around 0.57 to 0.58.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news is rather generic, mentioning Apple's involvement in AI discussions during earnings calls alongside other tech giants.  This lacks concrete details about Apple's specific AI advancements, strategies, or financial performance related to AI.  While the general positive sentiment around AI in the tech sector might exert some upward pressure on Apple's stock,  the lack of Apple-specific information significantly limits the impact of this news.  Analyzing the previous rounds of predictions reveals a consistent trend towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise (around 0.55-0.6) but with considerable uncertainty, as reflected in probabilities always close to 0.5. This indicates a lack of substantial market-moving information directly attributable to this news.  Considering the consensus among previous predictions and the inherent vagueness of the news, I've arrived at probabilities that are slightly above neutral, reflecting the persistent but weak positive sentiment surrounding AI and Apple's established position.  However, the influence of this particular news is likely to be modest, with significant impact more likely stemming from broader market trends or Apple's other announcements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news headline discusses how major tech companies, including Apple, are framing their AI narratives in earnings calls.
