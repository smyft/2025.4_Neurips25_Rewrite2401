      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech Stocks Rising as DeepSeek Fears Fade\nNews Content: Tech stocks looked set to lead the broader market higher on Friday as a wild week for markets drew to a close. The rapid rise of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model\u2013seemingly made on the cheap\u2013triggered a brutal selloff Monday, but tech stocks have pared back some of their losses since then. Apple CEO Tim Cook said DeepSeek was probably a \"good thing\" on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization has taken a \"prudent\" approach to capital spending.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple\u2019s prudent approach to capital spending, could positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend for tech stocks in general, with the initial fears surrounding DeepSeek's AI model subsiding. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. Furthermore, Tim Cook's comments about DeepSeek being 'a good thing' and Apple's 'prudent' approach to capital spending suggest confidence and stability, which can reassure investors. These factors point towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it is important to remain cognizant of the fact that, in the short term, broader market fluctuations and unforeseen circumstances can still negatively impact the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive overall sentiment for tech stocks, with the initial fear surrounding DeepSeek's AI model fading.  Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a prudent approach to capital spending. While the news doesn't directly announce any positive developments for Apple specifically, the broader market positivity and the CEO's comments suggest a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising. The overall market trend is a stronger factor than Apple-specific news in this instance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore higher, though not certain, given inherent market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including Apple, are recovering from a selloff triggered by concerns over DeepSeek's AI model. Apple's CEO Tim Cook's positive comments about DeepSeek and the company's 'prudent' approach to capital spending may reassure investors. Given the broader market recovery in tech stocks and Cook's reassuring remarks, the sentiment appears positive for Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as fears about DeepSeek's AI model have started to fade. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments that DeepSeek's advancements are 'probably a good thing' and that Apple has taken a 'prudent' approach to capital spending likely mitigate any negative impact and could boost investor confidence. Given this context, it seems more probable that Apple's stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to rise as fears about DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model fade. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, viewed DeepSeek's emergence as a 'good thing', suggesting that the company is not significantly threatened by the new competitor. This positive sentiment, combined with the paring back of losses since the initial selloff, suggests a likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the overall market volatility and potential for unexpected developments mean that there is still some probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
