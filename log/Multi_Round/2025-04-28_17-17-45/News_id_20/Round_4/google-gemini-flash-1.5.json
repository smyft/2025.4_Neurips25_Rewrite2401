(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech Stocks Rising as DeepSeek Fears Fade\nNews Content: Tech stocks looked set to lead the broader market higher on Friday as a wild week for markets drew to a close. The rapid rise of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model\u2013seemingly made on the cheap\u2013triggered a brutal selloff Monday, but tech stocks have pared back some of their losses since then. Apple CEO Tim Cook said DeepSeek was probably a \"good thing\" on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization has taken a \"prudent\" approach to capital spending.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek have lessened. CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple\u2019s prudent approach to capital spending, could positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend for tech stocks in general, with the initial fears surrounding DeepSeek's AI model subsiding. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. Furthermore, Tim Cook's comments about DeepSeek being 'a good thing' and Apple's 'prudent' approach to capital spending suggest confidence and stability, which can reassure investors. These factors point towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, it is important to remain cognizant of the fact that, in the short term, broader market fluctuations and unforeseen circumstances can still negatively impact the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive overall sentiment for tech stocks, with the initial fear surrounding DeepSeek's AI model fading.  Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a prudent approach to capital spending. While the news doesn't directly announce any positive developments for Apple specifically, the broader market positivity and the CEO's comments suggest a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising. The overall market trend is a stronger factor than Apple-specific news in this instance.  The probability of a price rise is therefore higher, though not certain, given inherent market volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including Apple, are recovering from a selloff triggered by concerns over DeepSeek's AI model. Apple's CEO Tim Cook's positive comments about DeepSeek and the company's 'prudent' approach to capital spending may reassure investors. Given the broader market recovery in tech stocks and Cook's reassuring remarks, the sentiment appears positive for Apple's stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as fears about DeepSeek's AI model have started to fade. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments that DeepSeek's advancements are 'probably a good thing' and that Apple has taken a 'prudent' approach to capital spending likely mitigate any negative impact and could boost investor confidence. Given this context, it seems more probable that Apple's stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to rise as fears about DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model fade. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, viewed DeepSeek's emergence as a 'good thing', suggesting that the company is not significantly threatened by the new competitor. This positive sentiment, combined with the paring back of losses since the initial selloff, suggests a likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the overall market volatility and potential for unexpected developments mean that there is still some probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in tech stocks, with CEO Tim Cook's positive remarks about DeepSeek suggesting that Apple views the development as an opportunity rather than a threat. This, along with a prudent approach to capital spending, enhances investor sentiment. The probabilities from previous predictions show a consistent belief in a positive trend for AAPL, with most predictions clustering around a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. Given the general recovery in tech stocks and Apple\u2019s strong market position, I estimate a higher probability for rising stock prices than falling ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The overall sentiment appears positive with tech stocks recovering from DeepSeek fears. Tim Cook's positive comments further reinforce a bullish outlook. Previous predictions are mostly positive, clustered around a 0.6 to 0.75 probability of a price rise. Considering this prior information, the continued recovery, and Cook's remarks, I am nudging the rise probability upwards slightly but keeping it consistent with earlier trends in belief. Some caution is warranted as unexpected market corrections are always possible.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. The easing of fears surrounding DeepSeek's AI model benefits the tech sector as a whole, and Apple, as a major tech player, is likely to see positive spillover effects.  Tim Cook's positive comments further bolster investor confidence. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the overall market volatility could still influence Apple's stock price negatively. The previous predictions show a consistent trend of a higher probability for a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Considering this consensus and the inherent uncertainties in the market, I am adjusting the probabilities slightly to reflect the potential for a small downside risk, even though overall sentiment is highly positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment shift in the tech sector, particularly for Apple Inc. (AAPL), as initial fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have subsided. Apple's CEO Tim Cook's comments, describing DeepSeek as 'probably a good thing' and emphasizing Apple's 'prudent' approach to capital spending, likely reassure investors and suggest that the company sees opportunities rather than threats. This, combined with the broader market recovery in tech stocks, supports a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, given inherent market volatility and potential unforeseen events, there remains a non-negligible probability of the stock price falling. The consensus among previous predictions (ranging between 0.6 and 0.75 for a rise) further supports this positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend for tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have lessened. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has positively assessed DeepSeek's advancements, calling them 'probably a good thing' and highlighted Apple's 'prudent' approach to capital spending. This positive sentiment, along with the broader market recovery in tech stocks, suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising rather than falling. However, inherent market volatility means there is still a probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a recovery in tech stocks as fears related to DeepSeek's AI model have lessened. Apple CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek, stating it's 'probably a good thing', and highlighting the company's 'prudent' approach to capital spending, are likely to reassure investors and boost confidence in Apple's stock. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive sentiment and the broader market recovery, the estimated probabilities are adjusted slightly higher than the average of previous predictions to reflect the ongoing positive trend and the potential for further recovery.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend for tech stocks as worries related to DeepSeek's AI model subside. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments suggesting that DeepSeek's development is 'probably a good thing' and that Apple has taken a 'prudent' approach to capital spending may ease investor concerns and bolster confidence. Multiple past predictions suggest a collective belief that the tech sector and Apple, in particular, might see an upward movement due to reduced uncertainty and cautious optimism. Although market volatility remains a factor, the overall trend leans towards a positive outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive shift in sentiment for tech stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (AAPL), as fears surrounding the DeepSeek AI model have diminished. Tim Cook's supportive comments suggest that Apple views these developments as beneficial rather than threatening, which can boost investor confidence. The overall market sentiment is leaning towards a recovery for tech stocks, further contributing to this positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions which clustered around a higher likelihood of price increase, I estimate the probability of rising stock prices for Apple to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The overall sentiment remains positive based on the news. DeepSeek fears are fading, and Tim Cook's comments suggest Apple is not threatened and is managing capital prudently. The previous round of predictions consistently shows a higher probability of the stock price rising, hovering around 0.65-0.78. I am slightly increasing probability of stock rising to account for the overall positive sentiment based on previous round of predictions and no new market volatility news\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple. The easing of concerns regarding DeepSeek's AI model benefits the tech sector broadly, and Apple, as a major player, is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment.  Tim Cook's positive comments further reinforce this bullish outlook. The previous predictions show a consistent trend of a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, with the probabilities generally increasing over the rounds.  While market volatility always presents a risk, the consensus among various models and the positive news suggest a strong likelihood of a price increase.  I've adjusted the probabilities slightly upward compared to the average of the previous round's predictions, reflecting the continued positive sentiment and the strengthening of the overall market trend.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment shift in the tech sector, particularly for Apple Inc.
