Such regulatory scrutiny can negatively impact investor sentiment due to potential fines, required business practice adjustments, and reputational damage. However, the article is behind a paywall, meaning the full details and the severity of the probe are unknown. Without the full content, a strong prediction is difficult. Apple is a large, resilient company and often survives these probes with minimal long-term impact. The initial reaction may be negative, but recovery is likely if the probe doesn't reveal significant wrongdoing. Thus, a slight leaning towards price decline is justified, but the risk is tempered by the lack of complete information and Apple's general stability. The market often overreacts to news like this initially, but then recalibrates.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.40,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.60\n}\n```"
