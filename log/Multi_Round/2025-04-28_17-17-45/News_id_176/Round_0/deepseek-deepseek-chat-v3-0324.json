(AAPL) is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges. Historically, regulatory probes can create uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors, often leading to short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position and financial resilience may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the nature of the news, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
