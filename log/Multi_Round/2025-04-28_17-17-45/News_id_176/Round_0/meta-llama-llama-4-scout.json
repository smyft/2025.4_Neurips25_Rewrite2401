This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased regulatory pressure, fines, or changes in business practices, which are generally perceived as negative factors for stock prices. Given that the news is about a potential regulatory issue rather than a positive development, it is more likely to negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the actual impact depends on the severity of the probe's findings and any subsequent actions. Based on this information, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
