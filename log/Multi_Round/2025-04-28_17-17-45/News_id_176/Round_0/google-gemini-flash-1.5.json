Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often introduce uncertainty into the market. While a significant negative impact seems unlikely given Apple's size and resources,  the investigation creates potential risks (fines, changes to business practices). This uncertainty tends to negatively impact short-term stock prices.  The probability of a price rise is therefore lower, leaning slightly toward a price decrease, although the impact is likely to be relatively minor compared to other factors that influence Apple's stock price in the longer term.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```\n"
