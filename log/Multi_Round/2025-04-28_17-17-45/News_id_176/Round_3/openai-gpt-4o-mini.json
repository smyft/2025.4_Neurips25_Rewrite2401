A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding a probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Such regulatory scrutiny can negatively impact investor sentiment due to potential fines, required business practice adjustments, and reputational damage. However, the article is behind a paywall, meaning the full details and the severity of the probe are unknown. Without the full content, a strong prediction is difficult. Apple is a large, resilient company and often survives these probes with minimal long-term impact. The initial reaction may be negative, but recovery is likely if the probe doesn't reveal significant wrongdoing. Thus, a slight leaning towards price decline is justified, but the risk is tempered by the lack of complete information and Apple's general stability. The market often overreacts to news like this initially, but then recalibrates.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often introduce uncertainty into the market. While a significant negative impact seems unlikely given Apple's size and resources,  the investigation creates potential risks (fines, changes to business practices). This uncertainty tends to negatively impact short-term stock prices.  The probability of a price rise is therefore lower, leaning slightly toward a price decrease, although the impact is likely to be relatively minor compared to other factors that influence Apple's stock price in the longer term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges. Historically, regulatory probes can create uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors, often leading to short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position and financial resilience may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the nature of the news, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased regulatory pressure, fines, or changes in business practices, which are generally perceived as negative factors for stock prices. Given that the news is about a potential regulatory issue rather than a positive development, it is more likely to negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the actual impact depends on the severity of the probe's findings and any subsequent actions. Based on this information, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to negative consequences for the companies, such as fines or changes to their business practices. As a result, investors may become cautious and sell their shares, leading to a potential decrease in stock price. However, it's also possible that the companies will be able to navigate the probe without significant issues, and the stock price may not be significantly affected. Given the uncertainty and potential risks associated with regulatory probes, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that both Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Such regulatory scrutiny often prompts concerns among investors regarding potential legal costs, operational changes, and reputational damage, which can negatively impact stock performance. While these companies have robust financial positions and could manage such issues effectively, the immediate reaction from markets tends to be negative. However, without further details on the severity of the probe, it's challenging to give precise probabilities. The slight positive signal comes from Apple's willingness to respond to the investigation, suggesting they might be addressing these concerns proactively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems raises regulatory concerns, which could create uncertainty and adversely affect investor sentiment. The probabilities from previous analyses predominantly indicate a higher chance of a decline due to potential fines, changes in business practices, and reputational damage. Although Apple is a resilient company with a robust market position, the immediate market reaction is likely to be negative given the nature of the news. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, with the majority leaning towards a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds regarding the UK probe suggests that the market is likely to react negatively to this news. While Apple is a resilient company, regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty, leading to short-term price declines. The lack of detailed information due to the paywall makes it challenging to quantify the impact accurately, but the consensus points towards a higher probability of a fall. Taking into account all previous rounds of predictions, there seems a strong consensus around a negative outlook. I will follow the trend of previous predictions instead of making dramatic changes.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem and operating system introduces uncertainty, a factor that generally leads to short-term market volatility.  While Apple's size and financial strength likely mitigate the risk of a catastrophic drop, the uncertainty itself is a negative factor.  All previous models predict a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase. The lack of detail in the paywalled article reinforces the uncertainty. The consistent predictions from various large language models point to a consensus leaning towards a negative market reaction. Though Apple's response to the investigation could be seen as a positive, it's too early to assess its impact.  Therefore, I am weighting the prediction slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledging the strong possibility the impact is minor and short-lived.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which introduces regulatory uncertainty. Historical trends show that regulatory probes often lead to short-term negative sentiment among investors, potentially causing stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position, financial resilience, and proactive response to the probe may mitigate some of the negative impacts. Given the consensus from previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to negative consequences for Apple, such as fines or changes to its business practices. Historically, regulatory probes have created uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors, often leading to short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position, financial resilience, and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the nature of the news, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty, which can negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple's strong brand, loyal customer base, and history of navigating regulatory challenges may mitigate significant negative impacts. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the regulatory scrutiny, but also acknowledging Apple's resilience and ability to manage such issues, I estimate the probabilities of stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a UK probe into Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which has historically led to regulatory scrutiny and potential operational adjustments. Considering the negative market response typically associated with such probes, the potential for fines, and the resulting uncertainty, the overall sentiment is inclined towards a potential stock price decline. However, the market often overreacts initially and can later recover if the probe does not result in severe findings. Apple, being a well-established company with significant resources, may handle the situation better than a smaller firm would.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Apple facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty that investors typically react negatively to. The previous predictions indicate a strong consensus around the probability of a stock price decline, mainly due to concerns over potential fines and operational changes resulting from the probe. While Apple's strong market position and financial resilience could mitigate some negative impacts, the overall sentiment is leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall given the nature of regulatory scrutiny. Hence, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be considerably higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.27, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.73, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across previous rounds, stemming from the UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem, strongly suggests a likely negative short-term impact on the stock price. While Apple possesses resilience and resources, regulatory scrutiny creates uncertainty. The lack of details within the paywalled article amplifies concerns, leading to a consensus leaning towards a price fall. The market's initial overreaction is anticipated, although the long-term impact is uncertain This prediction aligns with the trend observed in previous rounds, recognizing the potential for market overreaction and the inherent uncertainty associated with regulatory probes.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news of a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystem and operating system introduces uncertainty, which is generally negative for short-term stock prices.  While Apple's size and resources mitigate the risk of a significant drop, the potential for fines, changes in business practices, and negative investor sentiment from regulatory scrutiny remain.  The lack of detail in the paywalled article further amplifies uncertainty.  The overwhelming consensus among the previous model predictions is a higher probability of a stock price fall.  While Apple's response demonstrates a proactive approach, the information available is insufficient to overcome the negative sentiment generated by a regulatory investigation.  Therefore, the prediction leans towards a higher probability of a price decrease, but accounting for Apple's strong historical resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty, which historically leads to negative short-term sentiment among investors. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently indicate a higher probability of a stock price decline due to potential fines, operational changes, and reputational damage. However, Apple's strong market position, financial resilience, and proactive response to the probe could mitigate some of the negative impact. While the lack of detailed information (due to the paywall) adds uncertainty, the consensus leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall. Considering Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges, the impact is likely to be moderate rather than severe.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty, which can negatively impact investor sentiment. Historically, regulatory probes have led to short-term stock price declines due to potential fines, changes in business practices, and reputational damage. However, Apple's strong market position, financial resilience, loyal customer base, and history of navigating regulatory challenges may mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news regarding a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems introduces regulatory uncertainty, which can negatively impact investor sentiment. Considering the consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds of predictions and the historical trend of regulatory probes leading to short-term negative sentiment among investors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, Apple's strong market position, financial resilience, and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact. The lack of detailed information due to the paywall and the uncertainty surrounding the probe's severity also contribute to the negative sentiment. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, while acknowledging Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a UK probe into Apple's mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which raises regulatory concerns. Previous predictions have shown a strong consensus towards a higher probability of stock price decline due to potential fines, changes in business practices, and reputational damage. While Apple's strong market position and financial resilience may mitigate some effects, the immediate market reaction is likely to be negative. Therefore, considering the historical trends and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
