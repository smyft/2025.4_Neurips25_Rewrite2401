A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding a probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems could raise concerns about regulatory pressure on Apple, potentially leading to declines in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate significant negative impacts. Therefore, there is a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Such regulatory scrutiny can negatively impact investor sentiment due to potential fines, required business practice adjustments, and reputational damage. However, the article is behind a paywall, meaning the full details and the severity of the probe are unknown. Without the full content, a strong prediction is difficult. Apple is a large, resilient company and often survives these probes with minimal long-term impact. The initial reaction may be negative, but recovery is likely if the probe doesn't reveal significant wrongdoing. Thus, a slight leaning towards price decline is justified, but the risk is tempered by the lack of complete information and Apple's general stability. The market often overreacts to news like this initially, but then recalibrates.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystem and operating system.  Without access to the full article, it's impossible to gauge the severity of the potential consequences.  However, regulatory investigations often introduce uncertainty into the market. While a significant negative impact seems unlikely given Apple's size and resources,  the investigation creates potential risks (fines, changes to business practices). This uncertainty tends to negatively impact short-term stock prices.  The probability of a price rise is therefore lower, leaning slightly toward a price decrease, although the impact is likely to be relatively minor compared to other factors that influence Apple's stock price in the longer term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges. Historically, regulatory probes can create uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors, often leading to short-term stock price declines. However, Apple's strong market position and financial resilience may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the nature of the news, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to Apple's ability to navigate regulatory challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased regulatory pressure, fines, or changes in business practices, which are generally perceived as negative factors for stock prices. Given that the news is about a potential regulatory issue rather than a positive development, it is more likely to negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the actual impact depends on the severity of the probe's findings and any subsequent actions. Based on this information, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into their mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to negative consequences for the companies, such as fines or changes to their business practices. As a result, investors may become cautious and sell their shares, leading to a potential decrease in stock price. However, it's also possible that the companies will be able to navigate the probe without significant issues, and the stock price may not be significantly affected. Given the uncertainty and potential risks associated with regulatory probes, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that both Apple and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Such regulatory scrutiny often prompts concerns among investors regarding potential legal costs, operational changes, and reputational damage, which can negatively impact stock performance. While these companies have robust financial positions and could manage such issues effectively, the immediate reaction from markets tends to be negative. However, without further details on the severity of the probe, it's challenging to give precise probabilities. The slight positive signal comes from Apple's willingness to respond to the investigation, suggesting they might be addressing these concerns proactively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
