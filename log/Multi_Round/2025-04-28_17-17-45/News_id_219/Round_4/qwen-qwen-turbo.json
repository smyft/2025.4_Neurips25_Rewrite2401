(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple (AAPL) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\nNews Content: Why Apple (AAPL) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.1% in the morning session after Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the stock's rating from Hold to Sell, and echoed concerns about weak iPhone sales. Lee expects AAPL to report Q1'2025 revenue below consensus estimates when it officially reports earnings later in the month. Similarly, Loop Capital downgraded shares of the iPhone maker from Buy to Hold, adding \"Downgrading to Hold With Material Demand Reductions Ahead of iPhone 17.\" Overall, the weak sentiment highlights growing concerns about Apple's sales strength and dominance in the smartphone market.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $222.66, down 3.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nApple\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 3.2% on the news that data from research firm Canalys revealed the company (AAPL) is losing dominance in China. The data revealed that iPhone shipments in China fell 17% to 42.9 million units in 2024, pushing Apple down to third place in market share. The decline was partly blamed on the lack of artificial intelligence features in new iPhones. This weak print is significant for Apple since China accounted for roughly 17% of its total sales in fiscal year 2024.\n\nApple is down 8.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $222.32 per share, it is trading 14.2% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,809.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple shares by both Jefferies and Loop Capital, along with concerns about weak iPhone sales, indicates negative sentiment in the market. The stock has already experienced a significant drop and has a history of price volatility. Given the context of recent news and the fact that the stock has been trending downwards, the probability of a further decline seems higher than that of a rebound in the immediate future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two analyst downgrades, coupled with concerns about weak iPhone sales (particularly in China due to lack of AI features) and Q1'25 revenue below consensus estimates, point to a likely continued downward trend. While the article mentions potential buying opportunities due to market overreaction, the immediate sentiment is bearish. Apple's significant drop already this year and its distance from its 52-week high reinforce this view. Considering the market's reaction to previous similar news, a further fall is more probable than a rise in the short term. Though the stock market can correct, the trend mentioned in the news content is more than just one event. It shows that the stock price will probably fall more than it will rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple due to analyst downgrades citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This follows recent news about declining market share in China. While the article mentions the market's tendency to overreact and that the current drop is within the range of Apple's typical volatility, the confluence of negative factors (analyst downgrades, weak sales data in a key market, and projected lower revenue) suggests a higher probability of further short-term price decline.  However, Apple remains a strong company with a large market cap, and the long-term outlook is not necessarily doomed. The short-term negative sentiment is the primary driver of this probability assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade in Apple's stock rating by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee from Hold to Sell, accompanied by concerns about weak iPhone sales. Additionally, Loop Capital also downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold, citing material demand reductions ahead of iPhone 17. These downgrades reflect growing skepticism about Apple's sales performance and market dominance, particularly in the smartphone sector. The stock has already reacted negatively, closing down 3.2% on the day of the news. Given the heightened concerns and analyst downgrades, the immediate market sentiment is bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) has dropped significantly today due to downgrades from analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and demand reductions ahead of the iPhone 17 launch. Historically, Apple's stock has shown volatility with 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. Given the current negative sentiment and recent declines, there is a higher likelihood that the stock price will continue to fall in the short term. However, the market's tendency to overreact to news might also present a buying opportunity for high-quality stocks like Apple at lower prices.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a downgrade in Apple's stock rating by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales. The stock price has already fallen 3.2% in response to this news. However, the article also mentions that the stock market often overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Additionally, Apple's shares have been volatile, with 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year, suggesting that the market may be overreacting to this news. Considering Apple's strong track record and the potential for the market to overreact, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates multiple downgrades and concerns about weak iPhone sales and revenue expectations, which are likely to have a negative impact on investor confidence. Despite these concerns, market volatility suggests potential opportunities, and past performance shows resilience with a significant appreciation over five years.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent news on Apple Inc. indicates significant negative sentiment due to downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, which highlight concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue misses. The market has reacted by pushing the stock price down 4.1%, reflecting this pessimistic outlook. Given Apple's history of volatility, and considering multiple downgrades along with significant sales declines in key markets such as China, a consensus is building around continued bearish sentiment. Most models predict a high probability of further declines given the current context, outweighing short-term bounce-back potential. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the immediate future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment is bearish due to analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China. The stock has already reacted negatively, and previous predictions consistently leaned towards a price decrease (ranging from 0.7 to 0.8). Despite the mention of potential overreaction and long-term value, the immediate short-term factors heavily suggest continued downward pressure. The llama-3.3-70b-instruct model was an outlier in its prediction, which could represent some unavailable information, but most earlier answers gave probability of stock falling 0.7 or 0.8, so it is more appropriate to stick to these numbers. Recent news also indicates that the company has lost some important market share in China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Two analyst downgrades, coupled with concerns about weak iPhone sales (especially in the crucial Chinese market) and projected lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue, strongly suggest a bearish outlook. While the article mentions the possibility of market overreaction and subsequent buying opportunities, the immediate impact points towards a continued price decline.  The previous drop based on similar concerns of market share loss in China further reinforces this negative sentiment.  Although Apple's long-term prospects might remain strong, the short-term prediction leans heavily towards a price fall.  The previous predictions, largely leaning towards a fall, further support this conclusion. The one outlier (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) predicting a higher probability of a rise is outweighed by the substantial negative indicators presented in the news and the majority of other predictions. I give slightly higher weight to the probability of a price fall compared to the average of the previous predictions due to the concentration of negative factors impacting Apple's near-term prospects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, coupled with concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue. This negative sentiment is further exacerbated by Apple's declining market share in China, a key market. While the article mentions potential buying opportunities due to market overreactions, the immediate impact of the downgrades and the recent downward trend in Apple's stock price suggest a higher probability of further decline in the short term. Historical volatility and the stock's resilience over the long term do provide some counterbalance, but the current news and analyst actions are likely to weigh more heavily on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's stock price has dropped due to downgrades from analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and demand reductions. The stock has already reacted negatively, closing down 3.2% on the day of the news. Historically, Apple's stock has shown volatility with 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. While the market tends to overreact to news and big price drops can present buying opportunities, the immediate sentiment remains bearish due to the analyst downgrades and weak sales data. However, considering Apple's strong track record and potential for market overreaction, there is a balanced view that the stock might see a rebound. Weighing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term but acknowledge the potential for a rise due to market dynamics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a predominantly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to the downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and revenue expectations. The stock has already experienced a significant drop, and historical volatility suggests potential further decline. However, the market's tendency to overreact to news and Apple's strong track record over the years could present a buying opportunity. Considering the confluence of negative factors, including analyst downgrades and weak sales data in key markets, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns about weak iPhone sales and projected lower revenue, which has led to a significant sell-off in the stock. Previous predictions consistently show a bearish sentiment towards Apple's stock given the recent downgrades and market conditions. While the article mentions the stock market often overreacts to news, the prevailing sentiment from recent analyst downgrades and consistent bearish trends suggests a higher probability of continued decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent downgrades from two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, amplify negative sentiment around Apple's stock, with significant concerns regarding weak iPhone sales and an expected revenue miss in Q1'2025. Additionally, the market's reaction with a 3.2% drop immediately reflects bearish investor sentiment. Historical data indicates that Apple has been volatile, but the presence of multiple negative factors suggests a higher likelihood of continued price decline in the short term. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a price fall, confirming the market's cautious outlook amidst pressing challenges in key markets like China.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple is predominantly negative. Two analyst downgrades (Jefferies and Loop Capital) point to concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and potential revenue shortfalls in Q1 2025. The stock has already reacted negatively, experiencing a significant drop. The historical data shows volatility and recent underperformance compared to its 52-week high. While contrarian arguments exist (market overreaction, potential buying opportunity), the immediate pressure suggests continued downward movement. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a greater likelihood of a price decline, solidifying the bearish outlook. Although Llama-3.3-70b-instruct model previously offered an optimistic outlook, its recent prediction has swayed, further reinforcing downward consensus. I'm reducing my probability for a rise slightly to account for the continued negative sentiment and analyst actions in light of declining sales in the Chinese market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Two major analyst firms (Jefferies and Loop Capital) have downgraded Apple, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment is reinforced by Apple's declining market share in China, a crucial market. While the article acknowledges the potential for market overreaction and subsequent buying opportunities, the immediate impact of these downgrades and weak sales data strongly suggests a continued downward trend in the short term.  The consensus among previous predictions also leans heavily towards a price fall.  Although Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the short-term outlook is significantly bearish due to the convergence of negative factors.  The previous price drop following news of declining China market share further supports the probability of a continued decline.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. due to downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue misses. The stock has already reacted negatively, dropping 3.2%, and historical volatility suggests potential further decline. While the article mentions the market's tendency to overreact and potential buying opportunities, the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales data in key markets like China suggests a higher probability of further decline in the short term. Most previous predictions leaned towards a fall, reinforcing this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and revenue expectations. The stock has already reacted negatively, dropping 4.1% in the morning session and closing down 3.2% on the day. Historically, Apple's stock has shown volatility with 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. While the market tends to overreact to news and big price drops can present buying opportunities, the immediate sentiment remains bearish due to the analyst downgrades and weak sales data. Considering the confluence of negative factors, including analyst downgrades and weak sales data in key markets, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple due to analyst downgrades citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue. The stock has already reacted negatively, closing down 3.2% on the day of the news. Given Apple's history of volatility and the current downgrades, the immediate market sentiment is bearish. However, considering Apple's strong track record and the potential for market overreaction, there is a possibility for the stock to rebound. Weighing these factors and considering the previous predictions from various models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns about weak iPhone sales and projected lower revenue, which has led to a significant sell-off in the stock. Previous predictions consistently show a bearish sentiment towards Apple's stock given the recent downgrades and market conditions. While the article mentions the stock market often overreacts to news, the prevailing sentiment from recent analyst downgrades and consistent bearish trends suggests a higher probability of continued decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news presents a clearly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. with multiple analyst downgrades raising concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue misses in Q1 2025. Given the significant recent stock price drop of 4.1% and the historical volatility indicating that Apple tends to react strongly to negative news, the predictions largely align towards a continuation of this downward trend. Previous assessments have consistently indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling, supported by concerns about market share losses, particularly in China. Although some models suggest that the market tends to overreact and potential buying opportunities may arise, the prevailing sentiment remains bearish in the short term, leading to a weighted consensus favoring further price declines.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment driven by analyst downgrades (Jefferies, Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales and potential Q1 2025 revenue miss, coupled with the actual price drop and historical volatility, strongly suggests a continued downward trend. Recent data on declining market share in China reinforces these concerns. Previous model predictions overwhelmingly favor a further price decline, and the latest rounds show an increasing consensus towards this bearish outlook. While a market correction or overreaction could present buying opportunities, the immediate and near-term pressures prioritize a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two prominent analysts have downgraded Apple, citing weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment is compounded by Apple's declining market share in China, a crucial market. While the article suggests the potential for market overreaction and subsequent buying opportunities, the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales data strongly suggests a continued downward trend in the short term. The consistent bearish sentiment across previous predictions further reinforces this view.  Although Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the confluence of negative factors in the short-term significantly outweighs any potential for a near-term rise.  The historical volatility of Apple's stock is noted, but the current negative news is likely to dominate market sentiment in the immediate future.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a strong negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. due to downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue misses in Q1 2025. The stock has already reacted negatively, dropping 3.2%, and historical volatility suggests potential further decline. While the article mentions the market's tendency to overreact and potential buying opportunities, the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales data in key markets like China suggests a higher probability of further decline in the short term. Previous predictions from multiple models also leaned heavily towards a fall, reinforcing this bearish outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue misses. The stock has already reacted negatively, dropping 3.2% on the day of the news. Historically, Apple's stock has shown volatility with 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year.

Considering the confluence of negative factors, including analyst downgrades and weak sales data in key markets, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising in the short term. The consensus among various model predictions also leans heavily towards a continued downward trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a predominantly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. due to downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.
