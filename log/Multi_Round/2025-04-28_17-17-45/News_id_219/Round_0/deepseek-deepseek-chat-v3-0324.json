(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple (AAPL) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\nNews Content: Why Apple (AAPL) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.1% in the morning session after Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the stock's rating from Hold to Sell, and echoed concerns about weak iPhone sales. Lee expects AAPL to report Q1'2025 revenue below consensus estimates when it officially reports earnings later in the month. Similarly, Loop Capital downgraded shares of the iPhone maker from Buy to Hold, adding \"Downgrading to Hold With Material Demand Reductions Ahead of iPhone 17.\" Overall, the weak sentiment highlights growing concerns about Apple's sales strength and dominance in the smartphone market.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $222.66, down 3.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nApple\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 3.2% on the news that data from research firm Canalys revealed the company (AAPL) is losing dominance in China. The data revealed that iPhone shipments in China fell 17% to 42.9 million units in 2024, pushing Apple down to third place in market share. The decline was partly blamed on the lack of artificial intelligence features in new iPhones. This weak print is significant for Apple since China accounted for roughly 17% of its total sales in fiscal year 2024.\n\nApple is down 8.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $222.32 per share, it is trading 14.2% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,809.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
