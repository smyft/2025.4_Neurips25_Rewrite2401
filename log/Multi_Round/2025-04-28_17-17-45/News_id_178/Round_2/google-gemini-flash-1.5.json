      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple faces a 'fork in the road year,' analysts say\nNews Content: Photo: Cheng Xin (Getty Images)\n\nAs Apple (AAPL) stock takes a tumble to kick off 2025, analysts at Wedbush don\u2019t see cause for concern.\n\n\u201cWe believe the panic and bear frenzy around Apple is way overdone\u201d heading into next week\u2019s December earnings report, analysts led by Dan Ives said in a research note Wednesday.\n\nSo far this year, shares of the Cupertino, California-based company are down more than 8% as expectations around sales for the 2025 fiscal year fall short. Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.\n\nShares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.\n\nThis slide in stock price caused chipmaker Nvidia to overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nBut analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are \u201cmanageable,\u201d and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple\u2019s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.\n\nAs a result, the securities firm maintained its \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $325 price target\n\n\u201cWith Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nAlthough Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant\u2019s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a \u201cfork in the road year\u201d for Apple.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will Apple\u2019s AI strategy,\u201d Ives said. \u201cbut the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's situation, with analysts expressing optimism despite some bearish sentiments from others. While the downgrade from Jefferies and concerns over iPhone sales weigh on the stock, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook and a higher price target, suggesting that the current panic may be overdone. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism with a slight inclination toward a potential recovery, but uncertainty remains due to factors like upcoming earnings and product sales expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, the stock is down 8% YTD, and Jefferies downgraded the stock due to concerns about iPhone sales and Apple's AI strategy. The fact that Nvidia surpassed Apple in market cap is also a negative signal. On the other hand, Wedbush maintains an 'Outperform' rating with a significantly higher price target, citing a 'massive growth renaissance' fueled by AI and the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle. They believe the market is overreacting and view the China unit declines as manageable. The uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI partner and its overall AI strategy contributes to the volatility. The 'fork in the road' analogy suggests a pivotal moment where the stock could either continue to decline or rebound significantly depending on the success of their AI initiatives. Given the conflicting analyst opinions and the inherent risk in new technology adoption (AI), the probability of a rise is set slightly lower than a fall, recognizing present market pessimism, the competitive landscape and initial implementation risks with their AI strategy. The current small price increase of .25% is negligible to the overall situation highlighted in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies is bearish, citing weak iPhone sales and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  They downgraded Apple's rating.  Wedbush, however, maintains a bullish outlook, emphasizing the manageable China slowdown, the potential AI partnerships, and the long-term growth potential driven by Apple Intelligence.  While the short-term outlook appears mixed with concerns about immediate sales, the long-term AI strategy and Wedbush's strong price target suggest a more positive outlook.  The probability of a price rise is higher due to Wedbush's influential positive view and the potential for a significant upside if their AI strategy succeeds, despite current challenges.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there are concerns about weak sales expectations for upcoming iPhone models and a recent downgrade by Jefferies, leading to an 8% drop in stock price this year. On the other hand, Wedbush analysts remain optimistic, citing manageable declines in China and a potential AI-driven growth phase starting with the iPhone 16. The mention of a 'fork in the road year' suggests significant uncertainty, but the overall tone leans slightly positive due to the potential long-term benefits of Apple's AI strategy. However, the recent stock price decline and mixed analyst opinions indicate that the market may remain volatile in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's stock performance. On one hand, Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating due to expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades, which could negatively impact the stock price. On the other hand, Wedbush analysts are optimistic, maintaining an 'Outperform' rating and a $325 price target, citing that the panic around Apple is overdone and that the company's AI strategy, despite being late, will drive growth. Given that Wedbush's positive outlook seems to counterbalance Jefferies' negative view, and considering that Apple's stock has already taken a hit, there's a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price rising as the market may have overreacted. However, concerns about iPhone sales and competition in AI remain, keeping the probabilities relatively close.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with some analysts expressing concerns about the company's sales expectations and AI strategy, while others, like Wedbush, believe the panic is overdone and maintain an 'Outperform' rating. The article mentions Apple's stock taking a tumble, down over 8% for the year, but also notes that shares were up slightly on the day of the report. Wedbush analysts predict a 'fork in the road year' for Apple, expecting the company's AI strategy to transform its growth narrative. Given the positive outlook from Wedbush and the relatively minor daily stock movement, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock performance and future outlook. Wedbush analysts maintain a positive outlook and an 'Outperform' rating with a price target of $325, indicating bullish confidence despite current market sentiments. However, there are cautious notes from other analysts like Jefferies, citing weak sales expectations for upcoming iPhone models and concerns about the pace of AI strategy implementation. The current stock price has already factored in some negative expectations based on recent trends, but significant uncertainty remains around the December earnings report.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a complex outlook for Apple's stock. While there are bearish sentiments from analysts like Jefferies regarding weak iPhone sales and a recent stock decline of over 8% YTD, there is a significant counterpoint from Wedbush, which maintains an 'Outperform' rating and sets a high price target, viewing the market's reaction as overdone. The mention of a pivotal 'fork in the road year' suggests potential for rebounds, especially if Apple's AI strategy begins to yield results. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities reflect the underlying uncertainty but lean slightly more toward a potential rise, considering developer optimism and the manageable decline in China operations. The cumulative effect of varying forecasts places the likelihood of a price increase higher than that of a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a classic battle between bulls and bears regarding Apple's future. Jefferies' downgrade and concerns over iPhone 17/18 sales and the slow AI rollout weigh heavily, especially considering Nvidia's recent overtaking of Apple in market capitalization. This creates significant downward pressure, as does the YTD decline of 8%, showing existing investor concern. However, Wedbush's strong 'Outperform' rating and high price target, emphasizing AI's potential and manageable China declines, provides a counterargument. The sentiment 'fork in the road year' captures the high uncertainty. Considering the mixed analyst opinions in previous rounds, the slightly positive prediction in Round 0, I believe the scales tip slightly towards a fall. The initial market pessimism of Jefferies' downgrade and Nvidia's surge suggests stronger headwinds than Wedbush's optimism can immediately overcome, and the AI strategy being a 'phased rollout' suggests there is time for the market to negatively respond to any problems. The small rise of 0.25% on Wednesday is negligible and can be seen as noise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a highly divided analyst sentiment regarding Apple's future.  While Jefferies expresses significant concerns about iPhone sales and AI strategy, citing a potential miss on Q1 results and guidance, Wedbush maintains a strongly bullish outlook, predicting a substantial long-term growth driven by AI and a significant price target increase.  The conflicting viewpoints, coupled with the already significant YTD decline in Apple's stock price, makes accurate probability prediction challenging. The fact that Nvidia overtook Apple as the most valuable company underscores the current market sentiment leaning towards skepticism regarding Apple's near-term prospects. However, Wedbush's optimism, based on their belief in the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence and manageable issues in China, provides a counterbalance. Considering the historical predictions and the inherent uncertainties involved in gauging the success of a new AI strategy, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, acknowledging the risk associated with unmet sales expectations and the competitive landscape. The previous round of predictions show a wide range of probabilities reflecting this uncertainty. I am weighting the bearish viewpoints slightly more heavily given the current market environment and the risks laid out by Jefferies.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with conflicting analyst opinions. On the negative side, Jefferies downgraded Apple's rating due to concerns over weak iPhone sales expectations and limited hardware upgrades, contributing to an 8% YTD decline in stock price. On the positive side, Wedbush maintains an 'Outperform' rating and a $325 price target, citing overblown panic and a potential AI-driven growth phase. The stock's slight uptick (0.25%) on the day of the report suggests some resilience. Given the conflicting signals, the market is likely to remain volatile in the short term, but Wedbush's bullish long-term outlook and the potential for AI-driven growth provide some optimism. However, the immediate concerns about sales and AI strategy implementation weigh on the stock. Considering the previous predictions, which lean slightly toward a rise, but with significant uncertainty, the probabilities are set close to neutral with a slight tilt toward a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's situation, with analysts expressing both optimism and concern. Wedbush maintains a positive outlook and a higher price target, suggesting that the current panic may be overdone. However, Jefferies' downgrade and concerns over iPhone sales weigh on the stock. Considering the mixed analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy, I've taken into account the predictions from other models, which indicate a range of probabilities. The overall trend suggests a slight inclination toward a potential recovery, but with significant uncertainty. Given the influence of Wedbush's positive view and the potential for a significant upside if their AI strategy succeeds, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook on Apple Inc. Despite concerns from analysts like Jefferies regarding weak iPhone sales and AI strategy, the stock is partially recovering as market sentiments might be overreacting according to Wedbush. There's optimism around long-term AI growth and the upcoming December earnings report, yet immediate uncertainties exist due to product sales expectations and initial AI strategy impacts. The overall probabilities need a balancing act between short-term concerns and long-term growth optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
