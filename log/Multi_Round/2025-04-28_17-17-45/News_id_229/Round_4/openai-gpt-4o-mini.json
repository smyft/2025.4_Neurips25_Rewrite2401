(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump\u2019s inauguration can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, being part of a political event may signal alignment with potential pro-business policies or initiatives that could positively affect the stock market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. On the other hand, political events can also introduce uncertainty and potential backlash depending on public perception, which could weigh negatively. However, historical data suggests that such appearances by CEOs do not typically result in drastic movements unless accompanied by specific announcements or policy changes. Given the nature of the event and the overall market sentiment towards tech companies, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is generally neutral news. However, potential market reactions depend on investor perceptions of a Trump administration and its potential impact on Apple. Since Trump's policies are viewed as relatively pro-business, the market may see this as a positive indicator that Apple can navigate the coming political landscape effectively. Also, Apple attending along with CEOs of other big tech companies can provide a more positive view of Apple among investors. Given the very small scope and neutral nature of the news, the change can be expected to be small. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock will rise than fall. However, given market unpredictability, there always exists a possibility that the price will drop instead.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a neutral event with no clear positive or negative implications for Apple's stock price.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration affecting tech companies, the news itself provides no concrete indication of such changes or their impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with some slight skew towards neutral movement due to the lack of strong directional signals in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The presence of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 Inauguration could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might signal potential favorable policies for Big Tech under the new administration, which could be seen as positive for Apple. On the other hand, political events often introduce uncertainty, and market reactions can be mixed depending on investor sentiment. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall, but the impact is likely to be limited as the news does not directly affect Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO is in attendance at Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. This neutral event, which includes various Big Tech CEOs, does not inherently suggest a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The presence of the CEO at a neutral event like an inauguration is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending the Trump inauguration is neutral and does not contain any specific information about the company's financial performance, products, or strategies. The attendance of Big Tech CEOs at the inauguration is more of a political event than a financial one. However, the fact that the CEO of Apple is attending the event might be seen as a positive sign of the company's willingness to engage with the new administration, which could potentially lead to favorable policies or regulations for the tech industry. On the other hand, the news does not provide any concrete evidence of a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low and can be considered as a neutral event.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news mentions Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration, which is unlikely to directly impact investor sentiment or company performance. There's no clear indication in the news that would cause a significant move in Apple's stock price. The event itself is more political than business-related, and no specific business decisions or company changes are mentioned.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is primarily neutral, reflecting a significant political event with no direct implications for Apple's financial standing or future business moves. While appearances at such events can be perceived positively, suggesting alignment with pro-business policies, no specific developments or announcements were made that could lead to a substantial shift in stock price. Previous predictions have shown varied probabilities of slight increases but no overwhelming sentiment, indicating investor caution. Thus, I estimate a marginally higher chance for a price rise based on the general positive connotation of a pro-business administration but keep the probabilities relatively balanced due to the lack of strong directional cues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration, an event also attended by other Big Tech CEOs. This is primarily a political event. While some models interpreted this as slightly positive, others consider it neutral. The Qwen model gave an extremely low probability of movement. Given this range and the lack of concrete financial implications, a small movement is likely, though potentially slightly positive given previous models' slight lean. The slight increase than decrease is probably more in line with expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is largely neutral.  While some models suggest a slight positive bias due to potential pro-business policies under a Trump administration, this is purely speculative. The news itself offers no concrete information about Apple's performance or future prospects. The previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from near equal probabilities to a strong bias towards a price increase.  The lack of consensus among models and the absence of direct implications in the news itself suggest minimal impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the overall neutrality and the wide range of predictions from other models, I assign a probability closer to equal chances of a price rise or fall, with a slight skew towards neutral movement, reflecting the lack of strong directional signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration is primarily a political event and does not directly impact Apple's financial performance or business operations. While the presence of the CEO could be interpreted as a sign of engagement with the new administration, the event itself lacks concrete implications for Apple's stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news and the absence of any specific announcements or policy changes, the probability of a significant stock price movement is low. Previous predictions also indicate a generally neutral to slightly positive sentiment, but with minimal expected impact. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in stock price are roughly balanced, with a slight skew towards neutrality.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple's CEO attended Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, alongside other Big Tech CEOs. This event is neutral in nature and does not provide specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or strategies. The attendance could be seen as a positive sign of engagement with the new administration, potentially leading to favorable policies for the tech industry. However, there is no concrete evidence of a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the neutral tone and lack of specific implications for Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. But considering the slightly positive tone from other analysts and the pro-business environment which might favor tech companies, a marginally higher probability of a stock price rise is estimated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration is a neutral event that does not provide any specific information about the company's financial performance, products, or strategies. The attendance of Big Tech CEOs at the inauguration is more of a political event than a financial one. However, the fact that the CEO of Apple is attending the event might be seen as a positive sign of the company's willingness to engage with the new administration, which could potentially lead to favorable policies or regulations for the tech industry. Considering the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the mixed predictions from other models, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. This estimation takes into account the potential for positive market perception due to the CEO's attendance, but also acknowledges the overall neutrality of the event and the unpredictability of market reactions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO at President Trump's 2025 Inauguration. Although this event might be perceived as a signal of alignment with potential pro-business policies, it lacks concrete implications for Apple's immediate financial performance. The news does not provide any specific details that directly influence the company's operations or profitability. Previous predictions suggest a slightly higher probability of stock price increase due to speculative favorable policies, but the magnitude is expected to be minimal. Considering the neutral to slightly positive context, the probability remains modest.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration is fundamentally a neutral event as it denotes a political gathering rather than a direct business-related announcement. While the event could be viewed positively in terms of potential pro-business policies that might emerge from the new administration, there are no concrete implications for Apple's immediate financial performance or stock potential. The analyses of previous models yield a range of probabilities suggesting a slight overall lean towards a small increase in stock price due to the generally favorable business climate expected under Trump's administration. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability of stock price rise but maintain a balanced perspective considering the overall neutrality of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration continues to be largely viewed as neutral. While some interpret it as a potential sign of engagement with a pro-business administration (which could lead to favorable policies), there's no concrete impact on Apple's financials mentioned. Considering previous models' predictions which range from neutral to a slightly positive sentiment and the event's lack of financial implications, the likely price movement remains small and leaning towards a rise. Qwen's models continue to predict an overall more pessimistic movement that is lower then everyone else. I think its overall a neutral to slightly pro-business story, so a small rise is probably more accurate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is largely neutral.  While some might interpret this as a positive sign due to the potential for pro-business policies under a Trump administration, the news itself provides no concrete information about Apple's future prospects or immediate financial impact. The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities from a nearly even chance to a significant increase, indicating much uncertainty and little market consensus.  The event is primarily political, and the absence of any direct business-related announcements or firm changes means any stock movement will likely be small and short-lived.  Given the overall neutrality and the lack of strong directional signals in the news and the varied predictions across multiple models, I am assigning probabilities closer to equal chances of a price rise or fall, with a slight skew towards a neutral movement.  The convergence of predictions in round 1 towards a near 50/50 split reinforces the notion of limited impact from this event.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration is largely a political event with no direct implications for Apple's financial performance or business operations. While the presence of the CEO could be interpreted as a sign of engagement with the new administration, the event itself lacks concrete implications for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions indicate a generally neutral to slightly positive sentiment, with most models assigning nearly balanced probabilities. Given the neutral nature of the news and the lack of strong directional cues, the probabilities of a rise or fall in stock price are roughly balanced, with a slight skew towards neutrality.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's CEO attended Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, alongside other Big Tech CEOs.

Considering the neutral tone and lack of specific implications for Apple, as well as the mixed predictions from other models, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, taking into account the potential for positive market perception due to the CEO's attendance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO at President Trump's 2025 Inauguration. The event itself is largely neutral and does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, products, or strategies. While attending such a political event might be perceived positively by signaling alignment with potential pro-business policies, it lacks concrete implications for Apple's immediate financial condition or operations. Previous predictions show varied probabilities, with some models leaning slightly towards a stock price rise, while others remain neutral or slightly negative. Considering the neutral nature of the event and the overall mixed predictions, the probability of a significant stock price movement should be relatively low.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration is perceived as a largely neutral event, lacking concrete implications for the company's financial performance or operations. While there is a potential for positive interpretation regarding alignment with pro-business policies under a Trump administration, the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the political nature of the event and the absence of specific announcements affecting Apple's stock. Previous predictions showed slight variations leaning towards a modest price increase, yet overall sentiment remains generally balanced with a slight edge towards a price rise. Thus, I estimate the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration continues to be viewed as a largely neutral event. There's no concrete evidence suggesting direct financial implications for Apple from this event. Previous models have consistently predicted a near-neutral to slightly positive impact, mainly attributing it to the possibility of future pro-business policies under a Trump administration. However, these are speculative, and the event itself is primarily political. Considering the consistently balanced sentiment across previous predictions, I'm leaning towards a conservative estimate with a slight favoritism toward a price rise due to the perceived pro-business lean. Qwen's consistently lower probability of a rise compared to all other models suggests it might be factoring something I'm not, but the general consensus is that there is no concrete reason for the price to drop. Thus, I will stick to a small rise bias.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is largely neutral.  While some models interpret this as potentially positive due to the expectation of pro-business policies under a Trump administration, this is purely speculative. The news itself provides no concrete information about Apple's future prospects or immediate financial impact.  The wide range of probabilities given by the other models (from near-equal chances to a strong bias towards an increase) reflects this uncertainty.  The event is primarily political; any stock price movement will likely be minor and short-lived.  Considering the overall neutrality, the lack of strong signals in the news, and the convergence of predictions towards a 50/50 split in later rounds, I assign nearly equal probabilities for a price rise or fall.  A slight upward bias is acknowledged due to the generally pro-business image associated with Trump's administration, but the lack of specifics about Apple keeps the probabilities tightly clustered around 0.5.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 Inauguration is a political event with no direct implications for Apple's financial performance or business operations. While the presence could be interpreted as a positive sign of engagement with the new administration, potentially leading to favorable policies, the event lacks concrete financial or operational impacts. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, generally leaning slightly towards a stock price rise, but with most models acknowledging the neutrality of the event. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the mixed but slightly positive sentiment from other models, I estimate a marginally higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration is largely neutral, with no direct implications for Apple's financial performance or business operations. While the presence of the CEO could be interpreted as a sign of engagement with the new administration, potentially leading to favorable policies for the tech industry, the event itself lacks concrete implications for Apple's stock price. Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, generally leaning towards a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise but with significant uncertainty and no strong consensus. Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with a relatively balanced perspective.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration is primarily a neutral event, lacking direct implications for Apple's financial performance or business operations.
