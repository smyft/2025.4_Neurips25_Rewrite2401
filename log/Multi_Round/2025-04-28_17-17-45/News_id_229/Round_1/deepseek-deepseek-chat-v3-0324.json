(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance. Yahoo Finance host Rachelle Akuffo joins the program to acknowledge several of the Big Tech CEOs at Trump's swearing-in, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta Platforms' (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) chief executive, and even TikTok president Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAhead of the January 20 ceremony, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang stated he will be out of the country but \"look[s] forward to congratulating the Trump administration when they take office.\"\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump\u2019s inauguration can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, being part of a political event may signal alignment with potential pro-business policies or initiatives that could positively affect the stock market sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. On the other hand, political events can also introduce uncertainty and potential backlash depending on public perception, which could weigh negatively. However, historical data suggests that such appearances by CEOs do not typically result in drastic movements unless accompanied by specific announcements or policy changes. Given the nature of the event and the overall market sentiment towards tech companies, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is generally neutral news. However, potential market reactions depend on investor perceptions of a Trump administration and its potential impact on Apple. Since Trump's policies are viewed as relatively pro-business, the market may see this as a positive indicator that Apple can navigate the coming political landscape effectively. Also, Apple attending along with CEOs of other big tech companies can provide a more positive view of Apple among investors. Given the very small scope and neutral nature of the news, the change can be expected to be small. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance that the stock will rise than fall. However, given market unpredictability, there always exists a possibility that the price will drop instead.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a neutral event with no clear positive or negative implications for Apple's stock price.  While some might speculate about potential policy changes under a Trump administration affecting tech companies, the news itself provides no concrete indication of such changes or their impact on Apple.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with some slight skew towards neutral movement due to the lack of strong directional signals in the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The presence of Apple's CEO at Trump's 2025 Inauguration could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might signal potential favorable policies for Big Tech under the new administration, which could be seen as positive for Apple. On the other hand, political events often introduce uncertainty, and market reactions can be mixed depending on investor sentiment. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall, but the impact is likely to be limited as the news does not directly affect Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO is in attendance at Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. This neutral event, which includes various Big Tech CEOs, does not inherently suggest a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The presence of the CEO at a neutral event like an inauguration is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's CEO attending the Trump inauguration is neutral and does not contain any specific information about the company's financial performance, products, or strategies. The attendance of Big Tech CEOs at the inauguration is more of a political event than a financial one. However, the fact that the CEO of Apple is attending the event might be seen as a positive sign of the company's willingness to engage with the new administration, which could potentially lead to favorable policies or regulations for the tech industry. On the other hand, the news does not provide any concrete evidence of a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low and can be considered as a neutral event.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news mentions Apple's CEO attending Trump's 2025 Inauguration, which is unlikely to directly impact investor sentiment or company performance. There's no clear indication in the news that would cause a significant move in Apple's stock price. The event itself is more political than business-related, and no specific business decisions or company changes are mentioned.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
