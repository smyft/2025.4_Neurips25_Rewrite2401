(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The recent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok installed, driven by the temporary ban of the app, highlights the intertwined relationships between consumer demand, social media presence, and brand loyalty for Apple. However, while this situation creates a unique short-term market phenomenon, it does not have a long-term impact on Apple's core business fundamentals. The stock may experience volatility in the short term, but the company's strong brand and product ecosystem can support a resilient price. Market reactions can vary; some investors might view the frenzy positively, considering the increased demand for Apple products, while others may see it as a temporary spike. Overall, I estimate a higher likelihood of stability or slight increase rather than a significant drop in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: This news article, while sensational, has a negligible impact on Apple's overall financial performance and stock price. While it highlights the demand for devices running a banned application, it represents a very small niche market. The increased demand for iPhones with TikTok is temporary and doesn't fundamentally alter Apple's revenue streams, product demand, or market position. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a significant price movement. Potentially harmful associations by association with the 'frenzy' could cause a slight dip.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban and subsequent reinstatement of the app. While the high prices fetched on eBay for these phones illustrate the strong user base of TikTok, this event is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The core business of Apple remains largely unaffected by the temporary TikTok ban.  The inflated prices are a result of scarcity and short-term speculation, not a reflection of increased demand for Apple products or fundamental changes in its market position. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is very low. The probability of a stock price fall is also low, as the news is ultimately insignificant to Apple's overall financial health.  Any price movement would likely be minor and short-lived.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to the app's removal from the App Store. While this indicates strong brand loyalty and potential short-term revenue from secondary markets, it does not directly impact Apple's core business or financial performance. The situation is more of a social phenomenon rather than a fundamental change in Apple's operations. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral or slightly positive due to increased visibility and brand engagement. However, the long-term effect is uncertain and depends on broader market reactions and Apple's ability to capitalize on such trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed, selling for thousands to millions of dollars on eBay. This unusual market reaction could potentially benefit Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the short term due to increased demand for their devices. However, the long-term impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain and likely negligible, as the situation with TikTok is temporary and specific to a niche market. The overall impact on Apple's financials is expected to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a frenzy in the market for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a temporary ban of the app in the US. This situation has led to some iPhones being sold for thousands or even millions of dollars on eBay. The ban's impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-term, as the company's revenue is not directly tied to the availability of a specific app. However, the frenzy could lead to a slight increase in iPhone sales, potentially benefiting Apple. On the other hand, the ban and the subsequent uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the US may have a negative impact on Apple's reputation and customer satisfaction, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a surge in demand for iPhones as they contain the banned TikTok application, driving sellers to list these phones at significantly higher prices on eBay. While Apple benefits from increased interest in its products, the news also underscores regulatory uncertainty around popular apps, potentially affecting the broader technology sector environment. Moreover, Apple doesn't directly benefit from reselling used iPhones on eBay. Therefore, there might be a short-term positive impact due to increased sales and visibility of the company\u2019s products, but long-term effects could be mixed.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent frenzy around iPhones with TikTok installed suggests a spike in demand due to the app's temporary removal, leading to inflated prices on resale platforms. While this indicates a short-term interest boost for Apple's products, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be limited and transient. Most analysts predict that the core fundamentals remain solid, and while some may perceive the frenzy as positive for brand visibility, it is unlikely to cause a significant long-term effect. In weighing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower but notable probability of it falling due to potential negative associations with regulatory impacts surrounding TikTok.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment regarding the impact of the TikTok ban and subsequent iPhone frenzy on Apple's stock price. Most models consider the event a short-term phenomenon with negligible long-term effects on Apple's core business. While some see a slight positive impact due to increased visibility or short-term iPhone sales, others emphasize the regulatory uncertainty or lack of direct financial benefit for Apple from resold iPhones. Overall, the leaning is towards a neutral to slightly positive impact. However, considering the actual context based on my expertise, I think the previous round provided overweighted reasoning. The short-term volatility that I expect is based on speculation, rather than a fundamental shift in value for the company related to their actual business performance. While this would show up in short-term price movements, those with any long-term investment horizon wouldn't give this much weight. The lack of a sustained business model would further lower probability of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a short-term, anecdotal event with minimal impact on Apple's long-term financial performance. The frenzy is driven by a temporary ban on TikTok, not by inherent changes in Apple's product demand or market position. While the event might generate some minor positive short-term publicity, it's unlikely to significantly influence the stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. The consensus leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the magnitudes are low. I've considered this range and the ultimately negligible impact of the news to arrive at my estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban leading to a frenzy in the secondary market for iPhones with the app installed is a unique but temporary phenomenon. While it demonstrates the strong brand loyalty and demand for Apple products, it does not significantly impact Apple's core business fundamentals or revenue streams. The event is more of a short-term social media frenzy rather than a fundamental change in Apple's market position or financial health. Previous predictions from other models suggest a range of opinions, with some seeing a slight positive impact due to increased demand visibility and others considering it negligible. Overall, the likelihood of a significant stock price movement is low, but if any, the probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the increased attention on Apple products.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses a temporary frenzy in the market for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban of the app in the US. This situation led to some iPhones being sold for thousands or even millions of dollars on eBay. However, this phenomenon is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's core business or financial performance. The demand for these specific iPhones is temporary and represents a niche market. While there might be a short-term positive impact due to increased visibility and potential sales of used devices, the overall effect on Apple's stock price is expected to be minimal. The probabilities reflect a slightly higher likelihood of a stock price rise due to short-term demand and visibility, but both rise and fall probabilities are relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses a temporary frenzy in the market for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban of the app in the US. This situation has led to some iPhones being sold for thousands or even millions of dollars on eBay. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-term, as the company's revenue is not directly tied to the availability of a specific app. The frenzy could lead to a slight increase in iPhone sales, potentially benefiting Apple, but the overall effect on the company's financials is expected to be negligible.

While Apple benefits from increased interest in its products, the news also underscores regulatory uncertainty around popular apps, potentially affecting the broader technology sector environment. Moreover, Apple doesn't directly benefit from reselling used iPhones on eBay. Therefore, there might be a short-term positive impact due to increased sales and visibility of the company\u2019s products, but long-term effects could be mixed. Additionally, the high predictions and reasoning from past rounds suggest a cautious optimism, balancing between increased market visibility and regulatory uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The recent TikTok ban has caused a temporary surge in demand for iPhones that have the app pre-installed, leading to inflated resale prices. This phenomenon highlights strong brand loyalty and indicates interest in Apple products, although it represents only a niche market. Most models suggest that the long-term implications on Apple's stock price are minimal, expressing a consensus towards stability with slight optimism for a short-term rise in stock price due to increased visibility. Regulatory uncertainties surrounding TikTok and the temporary nature of the demand introduces caution, suggesting a moderate probability of a rise and a lower probability of a fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of stock price rise somewhat above that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The previous rounds of predictions show a general consensus that the TikTok ban and subsequent iPhone frenzy is a short-term phenomenon with minimal long-term impact on Apple's stock. Most models lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact due to increased visibility of Apple products. However, the argument that consumers will choose to pay a premium for an iphone because it has a specific app on it is weak because consumers will likely choose another product such as Amazon Fire Tablet if their desire it to only use tiktok. The temporary nature of the news event, the regulatory uncertainties, and the fact that Apple doesn't directly benefit financially from resold iPhones on eBay, all point to limiting any significant impact. I'll nudge the probability of a rise even lower than previous rounds, given the weak core argument that Apple benefits and the unlikelihood of a sustained demand from this short-term ban.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices is a short-term, anecdotal event with minimal impact on Apple's long-term financial health. The frenzy is driven by a temporary ban, not fundamental changes in Apple's product demand or market position.  While it generates some positive short-term publicity and *might* marginally increase used iPhone sales (which Apple doesn't directly profit from),  it's unlikely to significantly move the stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly towards a price rise, but magnitudes are low.  Considering the negligible impact of the news on Apple's core business and the consensus of previous models, a small probability of a price increase is warranted, but the probability of a price fall is even lower, reflecting an overall neutral-to-slightly-positive outlook but acknowledging the temporary and speculative nature of the event.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy in the secondary market for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban of the app in the U.S. While this highlights strong brand loyalty and demand for Apple products, it is a short-term, niche phenomenon that does not significantly impact Apple's core business fundamentals or revenue streams. The event is more of a social media frenzy rather than a fundamental change in Apple's market position or financial health. Previous predictions from other models suggest a range of opinions, with some seeing a slight positive impact due to increased demand visibility and others considering it negligible.

Considering the temporary nature of the ban and the niche market it affects, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively low.
