(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and Meta Surge While AI Giants Crumble--Is the AI Boom Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by rising iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan and investor optimism about more efficient on-device AI. The company's strong position in response to the overall market's AI sell-off indicates resilience. However, it does face concerns about iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts, creating some uncertainty. The looming earnings report on January 30 could also influence investor sentiment. Considering these factors, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The stock is currently up 3.7% in early afternoon trading. Positive factors include: 1) Perception that more cost-effective AI models benefit Apple's on-device AI strategy; 2) JPMorgan raising iPhone build estimates due to strong Chinese demand for the iPhone SE4. Counterbalancing these positive factors are: 1) The stock being 12% off recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns; 2) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital; and 3) Uncertainty pending the January 30 earnings report. Given the positive momentum today and the JPMorgan report, the probability of further positive price movement is favorable in the short term. However, the potential for negative news in the earnings report and the earlier analyst downgrades temper the overall rise, thus it is slightly favored for a rise. I am increasing probability of fall slightly to incorporate the mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant jump in iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan, suggesting strong demand, and the perception that smaller, more efficient AI models will benefit Apple's on-device AI capabilities.  This led to a 3.7% surge in the stock price during early trading. However, counteracting this is Apple's stock still being 12% off its recent highs, reflecting ongoing concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. The upcoming earnings report is also a significant uncertainty.  The broader AI market shift, with cost-effective models emerging, could indirectly benefit Apple, but it also creates uncertainty about the future valuation and growth potential of the overall tech sector. Considering these factors, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems reasonable, leaning more towards a rise due to the immediate positive market reaction and increased iPhone production estimates.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a 3.7% stock price jump due to optimism around cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand in China, which is a strong positive signal. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical event that could sway investor sentiment further. Overall, the positive news outweighs the negatives in the short term, but uncertainties remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock jumped more than 3.7% as investors interpreted the emergence of smaller, more efficient AI models as a potential benefit for Apple's on-device AI capabilities for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand from China, which could boost Apple's stock. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The overall sentiment seems cautiously optimistic, with a focus on the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to its potential to benefit from smaller and more efficient AI models, as well as an increase in iPhone build estimates. The article also mentions that Apple's stock has rallied, with a 3.7% increase, and that JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, but not extremely high due to the existing concerns and downgrades.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
