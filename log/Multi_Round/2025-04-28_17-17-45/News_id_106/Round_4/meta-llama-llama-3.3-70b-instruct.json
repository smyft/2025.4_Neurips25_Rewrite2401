(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and Meta Surge While AI Giants Crumble--Is the AI Boom Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by rising iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan and investor optimism about more efficient on-device AI. The company's strong position in response to the overall market's AI sell-off indicates resilience. However, it does face concerns about iPhone sales and downgrades from analysts, creating some uncertainty. The looming earnings report on January 30 could also influence investor sentiment. Considering these factors, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). The stock is currently up 3.7% in early afternoon trading. Positive factors include: 1) Perception that more cost-effective AI models benefit Apple's on-device AI strategy; 2) JPMorgan raising iPhone build estimates due to strong Chinese demand for the iPhone SE4. Counterbalancing these positive factors are: 1) The stock being 12% off recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns; 2) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital; and 3) Uncertainty pending the January 30 earnings report. Given the positive momentum today and the JPMorgan report, the probability of further positive price movement is favorable in the short term. However, the potential for negative news in the earnings report and the earlier analyst downgrades temper the overall rise, thus it is slightly favored for a rise. I am increasing probability of fall slightly to incorporate the mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include a significant jump in iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan, suggesting strong demand, and the perception that smaller, more efficient AI models will benefit Apple's on-device AI capabilities.  This led to a 3.7% surge in the stock price during early trading. However, counteracting this is Apple's stock still being 12% off its recent highs, reflecting ongoing concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts. The upcoming earnings report is also a significant uncertainty.  The broader AI market shift, with cost-effective models emerging, could indirectly benefit Apple, but it also creates uncertainty about the future valuation and growth potential of the overall tech sector. Considering these factors, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems reasonable, leaning more towards a rise due to the immediate positive market reaction and increased iPhone production estimates.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several positive developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a 3.7% stock price jump due to optimism around cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand in China, which is a strong positive signal. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical event that could sway investor sentiment further. Overall, the positive news outweighs the negatives in the short term, but uncertainties remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock jumped more than 3.7% as investors interpreted the emergence of smaller, more efficient AI models as a potential benefit for Apple's on-device AI capabilities for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand from China, which could boost Apple's stock. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The overall sentiment seems cautiously optimistic, with a focus on the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to its potential to benefit from smaller and more efficient AI models, as well as an increase in iPhone build estimates. The article also mentions that Apple's stock has rallied, with a 3.7% increase, and that JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, but not extremely high due to the existing concerns and downgrades.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The recent developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL) present a blend of positive and negative signals. The significant 3.7% surge in stock price reflects strong investor confidence, primarily attributed to JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and perceived benefits from emerging cost-effective AI models. This momentum is bolstered by expectations surrounding upcoming earnings, which analysts predict will be strong. However, concerns about iPhone sales, downgrades from analysts, and the stock being 12% off its recent highs contribute to uncertainties. Therefore, while the positive indicators seem to outbalance the negatives in the short term, the potential for volatility due to earnings reports and market dynamics indicates a balanced outlook. Thus, the probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is mixed but leans positive for Apple. JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for H1 2025, driven by strong Chinese demand, are a strong positive catalyst. The market's interpretation of cost-effective AI models as benefiting Apple's on-device AI capabilities also contributed to the stock's 3.7% rise. However, it's important to note that Apple's stock is 12% off recent highs and faces downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital as well as concerns about overall iPhone sales. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 introduces uncertainty. Considering the previous rounds of predictions averaging around 0.63, I am slightly lowering my prediction to account for the potential pullback after an initial surge, and market volatility. This rounds prediction is also influenced by observing others' opinions from the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include a significant 3.7% intraday jump driven by JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates (8% increase, citing strong Chinese demand for the iPhone SE4) and the perception that more efficient AI models will benefit Apple's on-device AI strategy. This is further supported by several previous model predictions leaning towards a price increase. However, significant counterpoints exist. Apple's stock remains 12% below recent highs due to persistent concerns about iPhone sales and analyst downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report carries substantial uncertainty. The broader AI market shift, while potentially indirectly beneficial to Apple's on-device AI, also introduces uncertainty regarding future valuation and tech sector growth.  While the short-term positive market reaction and increased iPhone production estimates suggest a higher probability of a rise, the existing headwinds and the inherent uncertainty surrounding the upcoming earnings report temper the overall bullish sentiment.  The consensus of previous models, while predominantly favoring a rise, also reflects this nuanced situation. I've adjusted the probabilities to reflect the overall mixed signals and the potential for negative news in the earnings report to have a larger impact than initially reflected in some of the previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mix of positive and negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's stock surged 3.7% due to optimism around cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones, and JPMorgan raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand in China. These factors suggest potential for further upward momentum. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds uncertainty. Given the immediate positive market reaction and increased production estimates, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling, but not overwhelmingly so due to existing concerns. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a rise, which reinforces this outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock price surged 3.7% due to optimism about cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones and increased iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan. However, concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts keep the stock 12% off its recent highs. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical event that could sway investor sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but uncertainties remain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, the emergence of smaller and more efficient AI models is seen as a potential benefit for Apple's on-device AI capabilities for iPhones, leading to a 3.7% stock price jump. Additionally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand from China. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical event that could sway investor sentiment further. Considering these factors and the trend of previous predictions, which generally favor a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.62 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.38.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors for Apple Inc., including a robust 3.7% stock price jump due to investor optimism about on-device AI benefits and improved iPhone build estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s bullish stance on iPhone orders, particularly for the upcoming iPhone SE4, further supports a positive outlook. However, lingering concerns over iPhone sales and recent analyst downgrades introduce some uncertainty. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report scheduled for January 30th could sway investor sentiment. Despite these potential negative sentiments, the overall reaction from major entities (JPMorgan) leans towards a bullish trend. Previous predictions have indicated a general consensus favoring a rise in stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but predominantly positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock has seen a significant increase of 3.7%, driven by optimistic investor sentiment regarding the advantages of cost-effective AI models for Apple's on-device capabilities and upticks in iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan, indicating healthy demand. However, the stock still faces headwinds from being 12% off recent highs, concerns regarding iPhone sales, and downgrades by analysts. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds an element of uncertainty that could impact the stock. Taking into account both positive momentum and potential risks, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising but remain cautious given the existing challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.64, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.36, Reasoning: Apple's stock saw a significant jump driven by optimistic sentiment regarding cost-effective AI and raised iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan. This positive momentum is tempered by existing concerns about iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and the stock being off its recent highs. The upcoming earnings report introduces additional uncertainty but is generally expected to be positive. Previous predictions lean towards a rise but are converging slightly downwards, suggesting an adjustment to a more neutral stance is appropriate without completely dismissing the initial positive signals. Given the slight lowering of probabilities by others model may be driven by the earnings. This may be correct or a contrarian signal. The contrarian signal make me slightly more bullish again.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include a significant intraday price surge (3.7%) driven by increased iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan (8% increase for Q1 2025, due to strong Chinese demand for the iPhone SE4), and the market's positive interpretation of cost-effective AI models as beneficial for Apple's on-device AI strategy. This is further supported by the consistent trend of previous model predictions leaning towards a price increase. However, significant counterpoints exist. Apple's stock remains 12% below recent highs due to persistent concerns about iPhone sales and analyst downgrades.  The upcoming earnings report on January 30th introduces substantial uncertainty. While the short-term positive market reaction and increased iPhone production are bullish signals, the existing headwinds and the uncertainty surrounding earnings suggest a more balanced outlook than a purely bullish one. The consensus of previous models, while favoring a rise, reflects this nuance.  Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect the overall mixed signals and the potential for negative news in the earnings report to outweigh the positive short-term momentum.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock price surged 3.7% due to optimism about cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones and increased iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan. These factors suggest potential for further upward momentum.

Given the immediate positive market reaction and increased production estimates, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling, but not overwhelmingly so due to existing concerns. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a rise, which reinforces this outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock price surged 3.7% due to optimism about cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones and increased iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan. However, concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts keep the stock 12% off its recent highs. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a critical event that could sway investor sentiment. Considering these factors and the trend of previous predictions, which generally favor a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.61 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.39.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news presents a mix of positive and negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the stock surged 3.7% due to optimism around cost-effective AI models benefiting on-device AI for iPhones, and JPMorgan raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand in China. Additionally, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds uncertainty. Considering these factors and the trend of previous predictions, which generally favor a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.63 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.37.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.64, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.36, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple positive factors for Apple Inc., including a robust 3.7% stock price jump due to investor optimism about on-device AI benefits and improved iPhone build estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s bullish stance on iPhone orders, particularly for the upcoming iPhone SE4, further supports a positive outlook. However, lingering concerns over iPhone sales and recent analyst downgrades introduce some uncertainty. Additionally, the upcoming earnings report scheduled for January 30th could sway investor sentiment. Despite these potential negative sentiments, the overall reaction from major entities (JPMorgan) leans towards a bullish trend. Previous predictions have indicated a general consensus favoring a rise in stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple Inc. presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. The stock saw a significant increase of 3.7% driven by strong investor sentiment stemming from JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates, fueled by optimistic projections surrounding demand in China. Additionally, the perception that smaller, more efficient AI models could enhance Apple's on-device capabilities contributes positively. However, the stock is still facing headwinds due to concerns over iPhone sales and recent downgrades from analysts, remaining 12% off its recent highs. The upcoming earnings report scheduled for January 30 introduces further uncertainty. Balancing these factors, there is a higher likelihood of a stock price rise, but caution is warranted given the existing challenges and potential volatility. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.63 for the stock price to rise and 0.37 for it to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: Apple's stock jumped 3.7% and JPMorgan raised iPhone build estimates, signaling strong demand, especially in China. Cost-effective AI models are viewed favorably for Apple's on-device AI. However, the stock is 12% off recent highs due to iPhone sales worries and analyst downgrades. The upcoming earnings are a major uncertainty, and previous rounds show a slight, converging downward trend in predicted probability of rise, suggesting caution. I will adjust my prediction to a converging value with a slight drop due to earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include a significant 3.7% intraday price surge driven by increased iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan (8% increase for Q1 2025, due to strong Chinese demand for the iPhone SE4), and the market's positive interpretation of cost-effective AI models as beneficial for Apple's on-device AI strategy.  This is supported by the consensus of previous model predictions leaning towards a price increase. However, significant counterpoints exist. Apple's stock remains 12% below recent highs due to persistent concerns about iPhone sales and analyst downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th introduces substantial uncertainty. While the short-term positive market reaction and increased iPhone production are bullish signals, the existing headwinds and the uncertainty surrounding earnings suggest a more balanced outlook than a purely bullish one. The probability of a rise is tempered by the significant percentage off recent highs and the analyst downgrades.  The upcoming earnings report is a major wildcard.  Considering the overall mixed signals and the potential for negative news in the earnings report to outweigh the positive short-term momentum, a probability slightly higher than 0.5 for a rise is appropriate, reflecting the balance between positive and negative factors. The analysis of the previous predictions also informs this estimate, indicating a gradual convergence towards this range.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc.
