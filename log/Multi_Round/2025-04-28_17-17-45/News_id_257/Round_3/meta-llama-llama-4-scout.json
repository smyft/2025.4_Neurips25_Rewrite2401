If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple's strong performance over the past decade, detailing significant stock appreciation and dividend payments that could attract long-term investors. It also notes that Apple is expected to report solid earnings growth, with a consensus 'Buy' rating and a modest price target upside of over 4%. However, given the modest upside and low dividend yield, growth-focused investors may seek better opportunities elsewhere, which could create some downward pressure. Therefore, the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, leaning towards rising probabilities but acknowledging potential market fluctuations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and potential future growth. While the historical data is positive, showcasing significant returns over the past 10 years, it also points out that the stock may not be as attractive to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to a relatively low dividend yield and limited upside potential based on current analyst price targets. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is important, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue. However, the article doesn't provide a strong catalyst for immediate stock price appreciation, more likely a neutral influence and future growth. Therefore, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price staying relatively stable or increasing modestly than decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price. This suggests a modest potential upside. However, the article also points out that the 4% upside potential may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield is not appealing to income-focused investors.  The article's inclusion of alternative investment options (real estate) might even suggest some readers will allocate funds away from Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, and the probability of a price fall or stagnation is higher due to the lack of significant bullish news and the potential for investor allocation to other opportunities highlighted in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, highlighting that an investment of $10,000 ten years ago would now be worth $92,281, representing an 822.81% total return. The article also mentions upcoming earnings reports, current analyst price targets, and recent financial performance. Despite a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target of $245.17, which implies a 4% upside, the article suggests that growth-focused investors may find the stock less attractive due to the limited upside potential. Additionally, the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may not appeal to income-focused investors. Based on this information, the probability of the stock price rising seems moderate, while the probability of it falling seems low but not negligible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's historical stock performance, with a 10-year return of 822.81% compared to the S&P 500's 228.10% return during the same period. The company is set to report its Q1 2025 earnings, with analysts expecting an EPS of $2.35 and quarterly revenue of $124.40 billion. The consensus rating among analysts is 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside potential from the current stock price. However, the dividend yield is relatively modest at 0.43%. Considering the positive earnings expectations and consensus 'Buy' rating, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. Nevertheless, the modest upside potential and dividend yield might limit significant growth, leading to a lower probability of a substantial stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations. The company's historical success and strong expected earnings have led to a positive analyst outlook. Despite the modest dividend yield and limited expected upside potential, the overall context suggests a stable and potentially growing stock. The news does not introduce any negative factors that would likely cause a stock price fall but does highlight a limited upside potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong past performance and significant returns over the last decade, which may instill confidence in potential investors. The upcoming Q1 earnings report is expected to showcase growth in both EPS and revenue, and analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating with a modest price target suggesting some upside. However, the limited upside potential of 4% and a low dividend yield of 0.43% could deter growth-focused and income-focused investors alike. Overall, while the historical performance is strong, the lack of compelling short-term catalysts reduces the immediate bullish sentiment, leading to a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance, showing significant returns over the past decade. Analyst expectations for upcoming earnings are positive (increased EPS and revenue), and there is a \"Buy\" rating with a modest price target increase. However, the article also notes that the 4% upside potential may not appeal to growth-focused and/or income focused investors due to the low dividend yield. Previous round opinions fluctuated depending on how much weight models gave to the positive history vs the concerns about growth potential. Almost all previous rounds gave a higher probability to price increase but none overwhelmingly so. Considering the factors, I would reduce the probability of price increasing due to the modest upside potential mentioned and the article implicitly directing growth-focused investors to other opportunities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news article focuses heavily on Apple's impressive past performance, which is positive but doesn't offer strong predictive power for future price movements.  While upcoming earnings are anticipated to be positive, the projected 4% upside is modest and might not excite growth investors.  The low dividend yield further limits appeal to income investors.  Several previous models express a similar sentiment, with probabilities for a price rise clustering around 0.55-0.65 and probabilities for a fall around 0.25-0.4. The lack of significant new information (beyond expected earnings) suggests the market will likely react with muted enthusiasm. Considering the consensus of previous predictions and the relatively limited potential for substantial growth, I am assigning a slightly higher probability for a rise than a fall, but overall the probabilities are relatively close to neutral due to the lack of strong catalysts in either direction. The significant historical return detailed is largely old news and not a strong predictor of short-term performance. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article provides a comprehensive overview of Apple Inc.'s historical performance, highlighting significant returns over the past decade. It also discusses upcoming earnings expectations, with analysts predicting growth in EPS and revenue. The consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target implying a 4% upside suggest a positive outlook. However, the modest upside potential and low dividend yield may not attract growth-focused or income-focused investors, potentially limiting significant price appreciation. The absence of negative catalysts and the overall positive sentiment from analysts support a higher probability of the stock price rising, albeit with tempered expectations due to the limited upside. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance over the past 10 years, with an investment of $10,000 growing to $92,281. It also mentions upcoming earnings expectations with a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors may find the stock less attractive due to the modest upside potential, and income-focused investors may be deterred by the low dividend yield of 0.43%. Considering the positive historical performance and earnings expectations, but also the limited upside potential and low dividend yield, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising, with a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Considering the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm. The predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some giving higher probabilities to the stock price rising and others being more cautious. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the modest upside potential, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's impressive historical performance, showing a significant return on investment over the past decade. Analyst expectations for future quarters and the consensus 'Buy' rating add to the positive outlook. However, the modest dividend yield and limited upside potential suggest that the stock might not immediately attract aggressive growth-focused investors or income-focused investors looking for higher yields. The overall tone of the articles leans positive but acknowledges a lack of immediate compelling catalysts for substantial price appreciation. The trend from previous predictions indicates a moderate belief in stock price stability or modest growth.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong historical performance, achieving an impressive total return over the past decade, and analysts expect positive growth in EPS and revenue for the upcoming earnings report. The consensus rating is 'Buy' with a modest price target indicating a slight potential upside. However, concerns arise from the relatively low dividend yield and the modest upside potential of 4%, which may deter some growth-focused investors. While the overall sentiment appears positive due to historical performance and strong earnings expectations, the limited attractiveness to specific investor types tempers enthusiasm for significant price appreciation. Thus, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting cautious optimism while acknowledging the risks of limited growth potential.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's strong historical performance but acknowledges limited upside potential and a low dividend yield, potentially deterring certain investor types. Upcoming earnings are expected to be positive. Previous models have generally leaned towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but not overwhelmingly so, suggesting a balanced outlook. Considering this, I slightly favor a price increase but account for the limited catalysts for significant growth, making the probabilities less extreme.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Apple's impressive past performance, which is positive but doesn't offer strong predictive power for short-term price movements. While upcoming Q1 2025 earnings are expected to be positive, the projected 4% upside is modest and may not be enough to excite growth investors. The low dividend yield further limits its appeal to income investors.  The previous rounds of predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight consensus leaning towards a price increase, but nothing definitive. The lack of significant new information beyond expected earnings suggests a muted market reaction.  Considering the modest upside, low dividend yield, and the consensus of previous predictions, the probabilities remain fairly balanced, although slightly favoring a price increase due to the positive earnings expectations. The historical performance data is largely old news and not a strong indicator of short-term price movement. The article also highlights alternative investments, which might implicitly suggest some readers will allocate funds away from AAPL. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's historical performance over the past 10 years, showcasing significant returns and a strong market position. However, it also highlights that the current price target implies only a 4% upside, which may not attract growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield might deter income-focused investors. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show growth, but the overall market sentiment seems cautiously optimistic rather than strongly bullish. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a moderate belief in stock price stability or modest growth. Therefore, while there is a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive historical data and earnings expectations, the limited upside potential tempers this optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance over the past decade, with a significant return on investment. It also mentions upcoming earnings expectations with a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the modest upside potential and low dividend yield may deter growth-focused and income-focused investors. Considering the positive historical performance, earnings expectations, and analyst outlook, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm. Based on the trend from previous predictions, there is a moderate belief in stock price stability or modest growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.31, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance over the past decade, with a significant return on investment.
