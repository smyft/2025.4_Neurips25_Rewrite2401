If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article highlights Apple's strong performance over the past decade, detailing significant stock appreciation and dividend payments that could attract long-term investors. It also notes that Apple is expected to report solid earnings growth, with a consensus 'Buy' rating and a modest price target upside of over 4%. However, given the modest upside and low dividend yield, growth-focused investors may seek better opportunities elsewhere, which could create some downward pressure. Therefore, the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, leaning towards rising probabilities but acknowledging potential market fluctuations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and potential future growth. While the historical data is positive, showcasing significant returns over the past 10 years, it also points out that the stock may not be as attractive to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to a relatively low dividend yield and limited upside potential based on current analyst price targets. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is important, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue. However, the article doesn't provide a strong catalyst for immediate stock price appreciation, more likely a neutral influence and future growth. Therefore, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the stock price staying relatively stable or increasing modestly than decreasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it doesn't provide new information directly impacting the stock price in the short term.  The article mentions analyst expectations for Q1 2025 earnings and a consensus \"Buy\" rating with a slightly higher price target ($245.17) than the current price. This suggests a modest potential upside. However, the article also points out that the 4% upside potential may not be attractive to growth-focused investors, and the low dividend yield is not appealing to income-focused investors.  The article's inclusion of alternative investment options (real estate) might even suggest some readers will allocate funds away from Apple. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, and the probability of a price fall or stagnation is higher due to the lack of significant bullish news and the potential for investor allocation to other opportunities highlighted in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the historical performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, highlighting that an investment of $10,000 ten years ago would now be worth $92,281, representing an 822.81% total return. The article also mentions upcoming earnings reports, current analyst price targets, and recent financial performance. Despite a consensus 'Buy' rating and a price target of $245.17, which implies a 4% upside, the article suggests that growth-focused investors may find the stock less attractive due to the limited upside potential. Additionally, the modest dividend yield of 0.43% may not appeal to income-focused investors. Based on this information, the probability of the stock price rising seems moderate, while the probability of it falling seems low but not negligible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's historical stock performance, with a 10-year return of 822.81% compared to the S&P 500's 228.10% return during the same period. The company is set to report its Q1 2025 earnings, with analysts expecting an EPS of $2.35 and quarterly revenue of $124.40 billion. The consensus rating among analysts is 'Buy' with a price target of $245.17, implying a 4% upside potential from the current stock price. However, the dividend yield is relatively modest at 0.43%. Considering the positive earnings expectations and consensus 'Buy' rating, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. Nevertheless, the modest upside potential and dividend yield might limit significant growth, leading to a lower probability of a substantial stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's past performance and future expectations. The company's historical success and strong expected earnings have led to a positive analyst outlook. Despite the modest dividend yield and limited expected upside potential, the overall context suggests a stable and potentially growing stock. The news does not introduce any negative factors that would likely cause a stock price fall but does highlight a limited upside potential.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
