A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), are experiencing gains. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, positive movements in tech stocks generally correlate with favorable outcomes for Apple stock. Thus, there is a higher likelihood that AAPL's stock price will rise in response to positive market sentiment in the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend for tech stocks in general, as the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is increasing. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector and heavily influences the XLK, it is reasonable to assume a slightly higher probability of its stock price increasing than decreasing. However, the lack of specific information about Apple and the general nature of the news make a strong prediction difficult. I have adjusted probabilities to reflect the likely positive influence of the sector-wide gains, while acknowledging that without Premium access, I can't determine the actual gain, and it may be nominal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), showing gains.  However, the content is incomplete, lacking specifics about Apple's performance or any specific news related to the company.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is based purely on the general sector trend.  It's plausible that Apple would participate in the overall positive sector movement, but there's no guarantee. A lack of company-specific news lowers our confidence in predicting a price movement, leading to closer probabilities to 0.5 than a definitive prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and often moves in tandem with sector trends. Given the positive momentum in tech stocks, it is likely that AAPL's stock price will also experience an upward movement. The probability of a rise is higher than a fall based on this sector-wide positive trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech stock. Given that the overall tech sector is experiencing gains, it is likely that AAPL will also see a positive movement in its stock price. The news suggests a general upward trend in the tech sector, which typically includes major players like Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), are gaining. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, a rise in tech stocks could positively affect Apple's stock price. However, the news provided is very general and does not specifically mention Apple or any significant events directly related to the company. Therefore, while there is a positive trend in the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple's stock is uncertain without more specific information. Given the general positive movement in tech stocks, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but both probabilities are relatively balanced due to the lack of specific news about Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, in general, are gaining as of Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the technology sector, and therefore, it is likely that it would benefit from the upward trend in tech stocks. There is no specific negative news mentioned that could cause concern for investors. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), experienced gains, suggesting a positive overall market sentiment in the tech sector. Apple Inc. (AAPL), being a significant player within this sector, is likely to benefit from the upward trend of tech stocks. Previous predictions are also weighted towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, owing to the positive sector performance. While the news lacks specific mentions of Apple, the overall trend in tech stocks supports a higher likelihood of a price increase than a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The previous round of predictions consistently leans towards a higher probability of AAPL stock price rising, driven by the positive sector update regarding tech stocks. The consensus centers around the idea that Apple, as a major tech player, will likely benefit from the overall upward trend in the sector. The premium news access restriction remains a constraint, preventing a more definitive assessment based on concrete gains. However, considering the prevalent sentiment in prior predictions, I am maintaining focus around the rise, but reducing the margin slightly due to the limited additional information between turns, and lack of news, just sector movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is positive for the tech sector as a whole, but lacks specific information about Apple.  The previous models show a range of predictions, mostly leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (0.55 to 0.75).  The consensus suggests a positive correlation between overall tech sector performance and Apple's stock price. However, the absence of Apple-specific news means the impact might be less direct than suggested by some models.  Considering the general positive sentiment and the historical correlation, a moderate probability of a price increase is predicted, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty due to limited information.  The prediction is adjusted slightly downwards compared to the most optimistic predictions from previous models, reflecting the possibility of the overall market impacting Apple less significantly than originally anticipated.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) gaining. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and typically moves in tandem with sector trends. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 for a rise, reflecting confidence in the sector-wide positive momentum. While the news is general and lacks specifics about Apple, the overall sentiment in the tech sector suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech industry, it is reasonable to assume that the company's stock price would also see an upward movement. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or direct news related to the company, the prediction relies on the general sector trend. The positive movement in tech stocks suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising compared to falling, but the lack of company-specific news prevents a more extreme prediction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), are experiencing gains. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, positive movements in tech stocks generally correlate with favorable outcomes for Apple stock. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models predicting a higher likelihood of an increase. The lack of specific information about Apple's performance and the general nature of the news lead to a balanced but slightly positive prediction. The positive trend in the tech sector, as indicated by the news, suggests that Apple's stock price is likely to rise, but the absence of company-specific news prevents a stronger prediction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend in tech stocks as of Friday afternoon, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) adding gains. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is often significantly influenced by the overall performance of the sector. While the news itself does not provide specific details about Apple, the positive sector-wide trend generally correlates with positive movements in individual tech stocks, including AAPL. Most previous predictions suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the lack of company-specific positive news keeps this probability slightly lower than the initial models' estimates.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.66, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.34, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend for tech stocks, including Apple Inc., which is a major player in this sector. Most previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to the overall positive sentiment in tech stocks. While the news does not specify any direct impacts on Apple, the general upswing in the tech sector suggests that Apple is likely to benefit from this trend. Therefore, considering all information and trends, I predict a higher likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The consistent positive sentiment around the tech sector's performance (indicated by XLK gains) and Apple's position as a major player drive the prediction. Previous models largely converge on an increased likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. While specific AAPL news remains absent, the prevailing sector-wide optimism justifies a higher probability of the stock price going up. A slight moderation from the initially higher estimates (0.75) acknowledges the lack of Apple-specific catalysts beyond the broad sector trend. All previous reactions predict that based on the information (a positive sector performance with some of the predictions being around 0.7) the model should weight on the side of predicting the probability that the stock will rise higher than the fall. Given that others lowered their predictions from the first to the second round, a slight decrease is also considered for this prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news reports a general positive trend in the tech sector, with the XLK fund showing gains.  Apple, as a major tech company, is likely to be positively affected by this broader trend.  However, the lack of Apple-specific news weakens the prediction.  The previous rounds show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of Apple's stock rising, ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 initially and converging around 0.65 for a rise in the second round. This convergence suggests a degree of confidence in the positive correlation between overall tech sector performance and Apple's stock price, despite the limited information.  Considering this consensus and the generally positive sector news, but acknowledging the absence of company-specific details,  I am adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards from the initial predictions to reflect the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector and typically moves in tandem with sector trends. Previous predictions from other models lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. While the news is general and lacks specifics about Apple, the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the lack of company-specific news prevents a more extreme prediction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, and its stock price often moves in tandem with sector trends. Previous predictions from various models consistently suggest a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The lack of specific information about Apple limits the confidence in a more extreme prediction. However, the general positive sentiment in the tech sector suggests that Apple's stock price is likely to rise. Considering the consensus from previous models and the positive sector trend, a moderate to high probability of a price rise is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) experiencing gains. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to benefit from this upward trend. Although the news lacks specific information about Apple's performance, the overall sentiment in the tech sector suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL. Considering the previous predictions, which consistently lean towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and taking into account the general positive trend in the tech sector, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The overall tech sector is showing positive movement as indicated by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) gaining. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in this sector, it is likely to benefit from the general positive sentiment in the tech market. Previous predictions have consistently leaned towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, with predictions ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 across multiple models. Although there is a lack of specific news regarding Apple, the historical trend shows that its stock often moves in tandem with sector performance. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.69, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.31, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, reflected by gains in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK). Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant component of this sector, and its stock price typically aligns with sector-wide trends. Previous predictions consistently favor a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. Considering this positive sector sentiment and the established trend from previous rounds, the likelihood of AAPL's stock price increasing is higher than that of it falling. slight increasing compare to the round 2, because of the stable positive performence between the rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news reports a general positive trend in the tech sector, with the XLK fund showing gains.  Apple (AAPL), as a major tech company, is likely to be influenced by this broader trend. However, the lack of Apple-specific news weakens the prediction.  The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent trend towards a rise in probability for the AAPL stock price, with earlier predictions ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 and later converging around 0.65 for a rise.  This convergence, despite the limited information, strengthens the belief in the positive correlation between overall tech sector performance and Apple's stock price.  While the initial optimism has waned slightly across the rounds of predictions, reflecting the absence of company-specific news and the inherent uncertainty in the market, the overall consensus maintains a weighted probability toward an increase in stock price. I've chosen to balance this general positive sentiment with the lack of AAPL-specific catalysts by converging towards the most common prediction, which centers around 0.65 for a price rise.  The absence of specific information, leads to a slightly lower probability of rise compared to the most optimistic earlier predictions. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.

Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but the lack of company-specific news prevents a more extreme prediction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech industry, and its stock price often moves in tandem with sector trends. Given the overall positive sentiment in tech stocks and the lack of specific negative news about Apple, there is a higher likelihood that AAPL's stock price will rise compared to fall. The predictions from previous models range from 0.55 to 0.75 for a rise, indicating a general consensus on the positive impact of the sector-wide trend on Apple's stock price. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or direct news related to the company, the predictions remain cautiously optimistic.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.
