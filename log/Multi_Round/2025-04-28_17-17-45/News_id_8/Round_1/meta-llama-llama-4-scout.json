A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), are experiencing gains. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, positive movements in tech stocks generally correlate with favorable outcomes for Apple stock. Thus, there is a higher likelihood that AAPL's stock price will rise in response to positive market sentiment in the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend for tech stocks in general, as the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is increasing. Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector and heavily influences the XLK, it is reasonable to assume a slightly higher probability of its stock price increasing than decreasing. However, the lack of specific information about Apple and the general nature of the news make a strong prediction difficult. I have adjusted probabilities to reflect the likely positive influence of the sector-wide gains, while acknowledging that without Premium access, I can't determine the actual gain, and it may be nominal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), showing gains.  However, the content is incomplete, lacking specifics about Apple's performance or any specific news related to the company.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is based purely on the general sector trend.  It's plausible that Apple would participate in the overall positive sector movement, but there's no guarantee. A lack of company-specific news lowers our confidence in predicting a price movement, leading to closer probabilities to 0.5 than a definitive prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and often moves in tandem with sector trends. Given the positive momentum in tech stocks, it is likely that AAPL's stock price will also experience an upward movement. The probability of a rise is higher than a fall based on this sector-wide positive trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major tech stock. Given that the overall tech sector is experiencing gains, it is likely that AAPL will also see a positive movement in its stock price. The news suggests a general upward trend in the tech sector, which typically includes major players like Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including those in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), are gaining. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector, a rise in tech stocks could positively affect Apple's stock price. However, the news provided is very general and does not specifically mention Apple or any significant events directly related to the company. Therefore, while there is a positive trend in the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple's stock is uncertain without more specific information. Given the general positive movement in tech stocks, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but both probabilities are relatively balanced due to the lack of specific news about Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, in general, are gaining as of Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the technology sector, and therefore, it is likely that it would benefit from the upward trend in tech stocks. There is no specific negative news mentioned that could cause concern for investors. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
