(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't\nNews Content: By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The ban on TikTok could positively impact Apple's stock price in the short term due to increased user reliance on Apple's infrastructure for alternative social media apps. However, the removal of TikTok from Apple's App Store could also create negative sentiment among investors, as this represents a reduced revenue stream from app purchases and subscriptions. The overall outlook suggests a slight upward trend in Apple stock due to potential gains from new users turning to other platforms and increased demand for Apple devices that might offer similar functionalities to TikTok.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of removing TikTok from its App Store and halting updates within the US, the ban itself doesn't directly and significantly impact Apple's core business. The removal from the app store could have a very minor impact (potentially a very slight negative, due to a slightly reduced user experience and perception of limited app choice), the scale is so small relative to Apple's overall revenue that it hardly register on Wall Street's radar. The article specifically quotes Apple declining to comment, indicating it is not a major concern. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a substantial positive or negative swing in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impending ban of TikTok in the US, and how Apple will be directly involved by removing the app from its app store and ceasing to distribute updates.  While Apple is a massive company and TikTok represents a small portion of its overall revenue, the ban could have a slightly negative impact on Apple's App Store revenue in the short term. However, the impact is likely to be minimal and not significantly affect Apple's overall financial performance.  The article also highlights that workarounds are difficult and unlikely to substantially mitigate the impact of the ban.  Therefore, the negative impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be small and temporary.  The market likely already anticipates this event, given the prior knowledge of the impending ban.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price change is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the U.S. and its implications for various service providers, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). As the article mentions, Apple and Google would be barred from distributing TikTok updates or the app itself in the U.S., which could indirectly affect Apple's App Store revenue. However, TikTok is just one app among millions in the App Store, and its absence is unlikely to have a significant material impact on Apple's overall revenue. Furthermore, Apple's diversified product lineup and strong ecosystem mitigate any potential negative effects. Given these factors, the news is unlikely to have a substantial impact on Apple's stock price. The probability of a stock price movement in either direction due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about a potential TikTok ban in the United States does not have a direct significant impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The ban primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, as well as other involved companies like Oracle and Alphabet's Google. For Apple, the impact is minimal as it is simply one of the app store providers that will be barred from distributing TikTok. The core business of Apple seems unaffected by this news. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this specific news is low. However, given that tech stocks can be volatile and news about other tech companies can have spillover effects, a slight negative reaction could be possible due to general market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which would affect Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the app is distributed through the Apple App Store. The ban would prevent Apple from distributing TikTok to U.S. users and would likely result in the app being removed from the App Store. This could have a negative impact on Apple's revenue and user engagement, as TikTok is a popular app with a large user base. However, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited, as the company has a diverse range of products and services and the App Store is just one part of its business. Additionally, the ban on TikTok may not be permanent, and the company may find ways to work around the restrictions. Overall, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is low, and the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which would impact its functionality and accessibility for millions of users. Given that TikTok is widely used and popular among younger demographics, a ban could lead to potential user loss and revenue reduction. While Apple itself is not directly affected, it will play a role in the enforcement of the ban by removing TikTok from its App Store. This enforcement might raise concerns about future regulatory interventions affecting major applications, creating market uncertainty, which typically leads to more conservative stock valuations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The potential TikTok ban could create a mixed impact on Apple's stock. On one hand, the removal of TikTok from the App Store may affect user engagement and create a slight negative sentiment among investors regarding Apple's revenue from app purchases and subscriptions. However, given that TikTok represents a small portion of Apple's overall revenue, the impact is expected to be minimal, and Apple remains a strong, diversified company. While some analysts predict a slight negative trend, the broader market context, which already accounts for such regulatory news, suggests limited volatility. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability for a rise in stock price as users may shift to alternative platforms and devices that require Apple products.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications. Apple is mentioned in the context of removing TikTok from its App Store and halting updates within the US. This could have a slightly negative impact on Apple's App Store revenue and user engagement, but the impact should be minimal in the short term. The previous model predictions are mostly leaning towards a slightly negative impact. Most predictions are that banning tiktok won't significantly affect Apple's stock price, due to its minimal impact. Considering the minimal direct financial impact on Apple, and the general trend of beliefs demonstrated by previous rounds of prediction, I expect the stock price to slightly decrease. However, the market may have priced in this information already.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news regarding a TikTok ban in the US has a very limited direct impact on Apple.  While Apple will remove TikTok from its App Store, the revenue generated from TikTok is likely a tiny fraction of Apple's overall revenue.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a slight probability of a price increase (due to potential shifts towards alternative platforms using Apple's infrastructure) to a small probability of a price decrease (due to a minor loss of App Store revenue).  However, the consensus leans towards minimal impact. Given the scale of Apple and the relatively insignificant nature of the TikTok revenue loss, any stock price movement is likely to be short-lived and small.  The market likely already discounted the event, given the previously announced ban.  Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to equal, with a slight tilt towards no significant change. The uncertainty in the market is a larger factor compared to this singular news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the United States primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, with indirect implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store. While this could slightly impact Apple's App Store revenue and user engagement, the overall effect is likely to be minimal given Apple's diversified product portfolio and the relative insignificance of TikTok's revenue contribution to Apple's total revenue. Previous predictions suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact, with most estimates leaning towards minimal stock price movement. Considering the broader context and Apple's strong market position, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the United States has a minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple will be required to remove TikTok from its App Store and cease updates for U.S. users, which could slightly affect user engagement and revenue from the App Store. However, given Apple's diversified business and the relatively small contribution of TikTok to its overall revenue, the impact is expected to be minor. The market likely already anticipates this event, and the ban does not provide significant new information that would drastically alter Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive sentiment from other emerging trends or market conditions, and a moderate probability of the stock price falling due to general market volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which would impact its functionality and accessibility for millions of users. Apple Inc. (AAPL) would be involved in the enforcement of the ban by removing TikTok from its App Store. While the direct impact on Apple's revenue is likely to be minimal, the ban could create market uncertainty and raise concerns about future regulatory interventions affecting major applications. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a general consensus that the impact on Apple's stock price will be small and temporary, with some models predicting a slight negative reaction due to general market sentiment. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which would impact its functionality and accessibility for millions of users. Given that TikTok is widely used and popular among younger demographics, a ban could lead to potential user loss and revenue reduction, though mainly for TikTok and its providers rather than Apple directly. While Apple will play a role in enforcing the ban by removing TikTok from its App Store, the core business operations of Apple remain largely unaffected. Previous model predictions suggest varying sentiments, but overall trends lean towards a minor negative impact, especially considering past forecasts and the relatively insignificant impact for Apple's overall business. However, there is a possibility of market uncertainty impacting Apple\u2019s stock negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
