(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, suggesting that these stocks may not perform as well due to slowing earnings growth and rising bond yields. Apple has already seen a decline in its stock price year-to-date, and the broader market sentiment seems cautious due to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic outlook. Thus, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price falling compared to rising in the current environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article suggests a potential shift in market focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other opportunities within the S&P 500. Key points include: 1) Apple's stock is already down year-to-date (-8%); 2) The article highlights potentially faster earnings growth in the other 493 S&P 500 companies; 3) It also mentions that expectations for Mag 7 earnings growth are slowing; 4) Rising bond yields are negatively affecting the Mag 7; and 5) BlackRock is advocating for investments in quality and growth at a reasonable price, which suggests some investors might be seeking bargains outside the Mag 7. The overall tone is that Apple might underperform relative to other stocks. There is a slight positive note as the IT sector (where Apple is) is projected for double digit profit growth. Given the negative sentiment towards the Mag 7, combined with some double digit growth, a moderate probability of the stock price to fall is assigned with a roughly equivalent probability for a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article focuses on a shift away from the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, towards a broader diversification within the S&P 500.  While Apple's recent performance is noted as down 8% year-to-date, the article doesn't directly offer bullish or bearish sentiment toward Apple specifically. The overall thesis is that the market may be over-concentrated in a few tech giants, and other sectors (like financials) offer better growth opportunities and more reasonable valuations. This indirectly suggests that Apple's growth might be comparatively slower than other sectors in the near future. The article highlights higher bond yields and potentially fewer Fed rate cuts, which generally negatively impacts tech stocks, to which Apple belongs. Thus, while the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling AAPL, it doesn't provide any positive news to drive an immediate price rise. The probability of a price rise is thus comparatively lower.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks, citing slower earnings growth expectations for the Mag 7 in 2025 (18% vs. 25% in 2024) and better opportunities in sectors like financials. Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, and the article implies that the Mag 7 may underperform due to higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations. The emphasis on 'growth at a reasonable price' and defensive strategies further supports a potential decline in Apple's stock as investors reallocate funds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag 7) stocks, which include Apple Inc. (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks. The article suggests that the Mag 7 stocks, including AAPL, may experience a slowdown in earnings growth, with AAPL being down 8% year to date. The overall sentiment implies a more challenging environment for tech stocks like AAPL, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, the article also mentions that investors are looking for 'quality and growth' and 'growth at a reasonable price,' which could mitigate the negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article suggests that the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple (AAPL), have been overcrowded and may experience a slowdown in earnings growth. In contrast, the other 493 S&P 500 stocks are expected to post solid earnings growth, making them more attractive investments. The article highlights the potential for double-digit profit growth in various sectors, including financials, information technology, and consumer discretionary. Given this information, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as investors may shift their focus away from the 'Mag 7' stocks and towards other opportunities.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks in the S&P 500 and recommends considering the remaining 493 stocks as they show potential for better earnings growth and better valuations. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven', it has shown recent declines which could potentially continue due to broader shifts away from these high-performing tech giants. The focus on quality and growth, along with defensive trading strategies, may further impact Apple negatively compared to other S&P 500 stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news suggests a shift in investor focus from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, which include Apple (AAPL), to potentially better performing stocks within the remaining S&P 493. The expectation of slowing earnings growth for the Mag 7, highlighted concerns about rising bond yields, and the focus on 'growth at a reasonable price' all imply a challenging environment for AAPL. Given that AAPL has already dropped 8% year-to-date and is part of a declining category of stocks, the probabilities lean towards a continued decline rather than a rise, supported by broader market sentiment and recent performance trends.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds strongly leans towards a negative outlook for Apple (AAPL) based on the provided news. The article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' towards the other 493 S&P 500 stocks due to factors like: slowing earnings growth for the Mag 7, relatively better opportunities in sectors like financials, rising bond yields negatively impacting tech stocks, and an emphasis on value investing. Apple's stock is already down 8% YTD which reflects existing investor concerns. Given these factors, a falling stock price is more probable. The fact that almost all models predicted a higher probability of stock price fall in the previous round reinforces the conclusion that there is not any other positive information that suggests the price will go up.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a shift in investor preference away from the 'Magnificent Seven', including Apple, towards other S&P 500 companies offering potentially higher growth and more reasonable valuations.  While Apple's IT sector is projected for double-digit profit growth, the article highlights several factors that could negatively impact Apple's stock price: slowing earnings growth for the Mag 7, rising bond yields, and a generally cautious market sentiment due to macroeconomic factors.  The year-to-date decline of 8% in Apple's stock price further supports a bearish outlook. Although the article doesn't explicitly recommend selling AAPL, the overall narrative suggests that Apple may underperform compared to other sectors in the short term. Considering the consensus of previous models leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, and the lack of strong bullish indicators in this news, I've assigned a slightly higher probability to a price fall. However, the possibility of a price rise still exists due to the IT sector's double-digit profit growth projection.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks due to slowing earnings growth expectations for the Mag 7 (18% in 2025 vs. 25% in 2024) and better opportunities in sectors like financials. Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, and the article suggests that higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations may further pressure the Mag 7. The emphasis on 'growth at a reasonable price' and defensive strategies implies a reallocation of funds away from high-valuation tech stocks like Apple. While the IT sector is projected for double-digit profit growth, the overall sentiment is cautious, favoring other sectors. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks. This shift is driven by expectations of slower earnings growth for the Mag 7 in 2025 and better opportunities in sectors like financials. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, and the overall sentiment implies a more challenging environment for tech stocks like AAPL due to higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations. However, the emphasis on 'quality and growth' and 'growth at a reasonable price' could provide some support for AAPL's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks due to slower earnings growth expectations and higher bond yields. Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, and the emphasis on 'growth at a reasonable price' and defensive strategies supports a potential decline in Apple's stock. However, the information technology sector, where Apple belongs, is projected for double-digit profit growth. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the overall market sentiment, the probability of Apple's stock price falling seems higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple (AAPL), to other S&P 500 stocks that may show stronger growth and better valuations. The article mentions that Apple has already declined year-to-date and that the broader market is becoming cautious due to rising bond yields and a changing economic environment. Although the IT sector (where Apple operates) is expected to see double-digit profit growth, the overall sentiment is against the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. This suggests that there is a higher probability that Apple's stock price may fall despite the growth prospects.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, towards other S&P 500 stocks that may have better growth potential. It points to slower earnings growth for the Mag 7, including Apple, along with the impact of rising bond yields, which traditionally affects technology stocks negatively. Apple's year-to-date decline of 8% further reflects existing negative sentiment. While there is mention of double-digit profit growth in the IT sector, the overall market sentiment appears cautious, favoring other sectors over Apple. The trends and previous predictions lean heavily towards a higher probability of decline in Apple's stock price, given the broader economic and sector-specific challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The trend from previous rounds and the current news article continues to suggest a negative outlook for Apple. The article highlights the potential for slower earnings growth compared to other S&P 500 stocks, factors like rising bond yields that negatively impact tech stocks, and an overall shift in investor preference away from the 'Magnificent Seven.' Apple being down 8% YTD is a significant negative indicator. The slight uptick in probability of price rising doesn't offset the strong bearish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is still considerably higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a shift in investor sentiment away from the 'Magnificent Seven', including Apple, towards other S&P 500 companies perceived as offering better value and growth prospects.  Several factors contribute to a bearish outlook for Apple in the short term: slowing earnings growth for the Mag 7, rising bond yields impacting tech stocks negatively, Apple's existing year-to-date decline of 8%, and the overall cautious market sentiment. While the IT sector shows projected double-digit profit growth, the article's central theme suggests that Apple may underperform relative to other sectors in the near future.  The consensus from previous prediction rounds strongly reinforces the negative sentiment. Although there is potential for a rise considering the IT sector's positive outlook and the possibility that the market might overreact to the shift in investor focus, the overwhelming factors suggest a higher probability of a fall. I am slightly increasing the probability of a fall compared to previous rounds due to the accumulating evidence of negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks due to slower earnings growth expectations and higher bond yields.

Multiple previous predictions indicate a consistent belief that Apple might underperform relative to other sectors due to slower earnings growth, rising bond yields, and a focus on growth at a reasonable price. Despite a positive outlook for the IT sector, the overall market sentiment and existing downward trend in Apple's stock price suggest a higher likelihood of a continued decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
