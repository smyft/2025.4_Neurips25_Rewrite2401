(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today\nNews Content: Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple by two analysts due to disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in the Chinese market, suggests negative sentiment around the stock. Jefferies' revision of its price target down to $200.75 and the concerns over the potential for a decline in sales reinforce a bearish outlook. Although some analysts maintain a long-term positive view, the immediate impacts from both downgrades and disappointing sales figures will likely lead to further selling pressure on the stock in the short term. Given the current valuation and market conditions, the probabilities lean towards a decrease in stock price until new data or positive momentum materializes.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two analysts downgraded Apple due to concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in China. The article highlights potential issues with consumer perception of Apple Intelligence and concerns about valuation. While there's a mention of long-term potential from AI, the immediate outlook is pessimistic and suggests possible weak forward guidance. The article also contains some generic advertising content that's not relevant to objective analysis of the current situation. I am assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling in the short term due to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. Two analysts downgraded Apple's rating, citing disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China.  Concerns about weaker-than-expected AI integration and a high valuation relative to growth also contribute to the negative sentiment. While there is optimism regarding potential future growth, the immediate outlook seems bearish due to current sales figures and analyst predictions. The 4.1% drop on the day of the news release further supports the negative sentiment.  The mention of a \"Double Down\" opportunity is marketing material and not relevant to evaluating the immediate impact of the reported news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a 4.1% drop in Apple's stock price due to downgrades from two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China. The analysts also expressed concerns about the delayed impact of Apple's AI initiatives and weak forward guidance. While Loop Capital remains optimistic about long-term growth, the immediate outlook appears negative. Given the downgrades, weak sales data, and high valuation, the short-term sentiment is bearish. However, Apple's strong customer base provides some downside protection.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales and potential weak guidance for the March quarter. The downgrades and lowered price targets suggest a negative outlook for Apple's short-term performance. Additionally, concerns about Apple's valuation, with a high P/E ratio of over 36 times earnings, and its complications in China, both from a demand and manufacturing perspective, contribute to the negative sentiment. While Loop Capital still believes in Apple's long-term growth prospects, particularly in AI, the immediate outlook appears bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to being downgraded by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China. The analysts' downgrades and lowered price targets suggest a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's valuation appears expensive, and the company's ability to execute on AI is uncertain. However, the article also notes that Apple has a huge, sticky customer base, which could provide some support for the stock. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and projections of weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, which has led to a significant drop in stock price. With concerns regarding the market response to poor performance in key geographies and the timing of an anticipated AI-powered upgrade cycle being delayed, the stock faces challenges. Moreover, the current valuation is considered high, further complicating bullish sentiment. These factors collectively contribute to a negative outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrades by two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, coupled with significant revisions to iPhone sales forecasts, particularly in the critical Chinese market, present a strong negative sentiment for Apple Inc. The news highlights a 4.1% decrease in stock price immediately following the downgrades, suggesting the market's reaction is already bearish. Both analysts express concerns over current trends and the potential for weak guidance, with Jefferies showing a particularly pessimistic outlook regarding sales declines. Although Loop maintains a long-term positive view due to AI potential, the immediate impact still leans towards a decline in stock price, reinforced by the overall high valuation of Apple that leaves less room for error. Therefore, the probabilities tilt significantly towards falling stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous predictions is strongly bearish, with an average probability of stock price falling around 0.73. The primary drivers are negative news including analyst downgrades, disappointing iPhone sales (especially in China), and concerns about AI execution. Although Apple has a strong customer base, current valuation is high, leaving little room for error, according to the news article. Given the consistent negative sentiment across various models and the actual 4.1% price drop, the likelihood of the stock falling remains elevated. No updates since Round 0 indicate a change in the negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two prominent analysts downgraded Apple, citing disappointing iPhone sales, particularly a significant drop in China.  Concerns about the delayed impact of AI integration and Apple's high valuation relative to its growth rate further exacerbate the negative sentiment. While some analysts express long-term optimism regarding Apple's AI potential, the immediate concerns around current sales and near-term guidance strongly suggest a bearish outlook. The 4.1% drop on the day of the news release reinforces this negative sentiment. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Considering all these factors, I am assigning a slightly higher probability of a price fall than the previous models, reflecting the significant negative impact of the analyst downgrades and weak sales data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reports a 4.1% drop in Apple's stock price following downgrades by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital. The downgrades were due to disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, especially in China, and concerns about weak forward guidance. Additionally, Apple's high valuation and uncertainties around its AI execution further contribute to negative sentiment. While there is some optimism about long-term growth, the immediate outlook is bearish. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple's stock price due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China.

While Loop Capital still believes in Apple's long-term growth prospects, particularly in AI, the immediate outlook appears bearish. Considering the consensus among multiple models, which generally predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, the estimated probabilities are aligned with the negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to being downgraded by two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China.
