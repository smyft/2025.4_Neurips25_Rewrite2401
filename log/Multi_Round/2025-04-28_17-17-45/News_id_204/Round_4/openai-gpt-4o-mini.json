(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge.

The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares can be interpreted as a bearish signal, as significant insider selling often raises concerns among investors. However, the impact of such a trade on the overall market sentiment regarding Apple may be mitigated by the broader context, including the performance of their products and financial standing. The news might lead to increased skepticism in the short term, but given Apple's strong brand and market fundamentals, the stock might not fall drastically. Therefore, while the probability of a price fall increases due to the news of the sale, the overall strength of Apple's position in the market maintains a reasonable probability of price stability or a slight rise in the longer term if investor sentiment remains resilient. Ultimately, the probabilities are derived by weighing both the negative signal from the sell-off against the prevailing positive fundamentals of the company.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple (AAPL) stock. While Pelosi's trades have garnered attention and sometimes outperform the market, her actions don't automatically guarantee a specific stock price movement. The potential negative impact of a large sale of AAPL stock described in this article is somewhat balanced by the fact that this happened in the recent past (Dec 31st). Therefore, its influence has been somewhat included in the current market price. However, the negative sentiment of the sale and how people potentially react to the sale need to be considered. Hence, there is a slightly increased probability of a stock price fall. Also, broader market conditions and company-specific factors will significantly impact the price. So while the news might exert some pressure, the potential for the stock to maintain or slightly increase is still there. Overall sentiment can potentially push it down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple stock. While Pelosi's trades don't inherently predict market movements, the sale of a large holding by a prominent figure can be interpreted by some investors as a negative signal, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock price. However, this effect is likely to be relatively small compared to broader market factors and Apple's own performance.  The article also highlights that a Pelosi stock tracker had high returns in 2024, which could be interpreted by some as adding weight to the trades made by Pelosi. In contrast, it also mentions criticism of her trading activity and calls for stricter regulation, which may not directly affect AAPL but might highlight investor uncertainty. Overall, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, with the probability of a price decrease being slightly higher than the probability of an increase, though neither is likely to be significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term performance. Given Pelosi's track record of successful trades, her actions might influence market sentiment negatively for AAPL. However, Apple is a large-cap stock with strong fundamentals, and Pelosi's sale might not have a substantial long-term impact. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the potential short-term negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi, a prominent political figure, has sold her shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and has instead invested in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The sale of Apple shares by a high-profile investor like Pelosi might be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, it is essential to note that stock movements are influenced by a myriad of factors, and Pelosi\u2019s actions alone may not dictate the stock's direction. Given the information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but the overall market conditions and other influencing factors should also be considered.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, as disclosed in the news, could be perceived as a negative signal by some investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's trades, including her recent purchase of Alphabet and Amazon calls, are part of her investment strategy and may not directly influence the overall market sentiment towards Apple. The news may have a short-term impact on the stock price, but the company's fundamentals, product releases, and overall market conditions will likely have a more significant influence on its long-term performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent trades indicate she disposed a significant amount of Apple shares on Dec 31. While individual trades by political figures do not necessarily predict market movements, they can be interpreted as signs of confidence or lack thereof in those companies. There is no specific positive or negative news about Apple Inc directly mentioned in the article apart from her selling actions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding Nancy Pelosi's sale of $5 million to $25 million in Apple shares can be seen as a significant indicator of potential negative sentiment towards AAPL. Generally, the sale of large stock holdings by notable figures is often interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term performance. Past predictions have consistently shown a higher probability of falling prices following similar news. While Apple's strong market fundamentals may support its price resilience, the critical takeaway from Pelosi's actions suggests a prevailing bearish sentiment, leading to an estimated slight increase in the probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price due to Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant number of shares. This action is generally seen as a bearish signal, although the impact might be buffered by Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering that the sale already occurred on December 31st, much of its effect might be priced into the current stock value. However, Pelosi's trading activities elicit strong reactions from the market, and her actions are closely watched, with some associating a negative signal to the stocks she sells. The general prevailing sentiment is that there is slightly more probability of a stock price fall. I will maintain the general consensus and adjust slightly to reflect her actions already being priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports Nancy Pelosi selling a substantial amount of Apple stock. While her trading activity doesn't directly predict market movements, the sale of such a large holding by a prominent figure like Pelosi could negatively influence investor sentiment.  This could lead to some downward pressure on the stock price, particularly in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and market position likely mitigate the impact.  The fact that the sale occurred on December 31st suggests the market has already partially digested this information.  The consensus among previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the probabilities are generally clustered around 0.4 for a rise and 0.6 for a fall, suggesting a relatively muted impact.  Considering the previous predictions and weighing the negative sentiment against Apple's strong position, I'm adjusting slightly to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price fall, though it is unlikely to be dramatic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile political figure, sold a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which could be perceived as a negative signal by the market. Historically, large insider sales can influence investor sentiment negatively, especially when coming from a figure with a track record of successful trades. While Apple's strong fundamentals and market position may mitigate some of the downward pressure, the short-term impact of this news is likely to skew towards a negative reaction. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reinforcing this view. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising in the immediate aftermath of this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which could be interpreted as a negative signal by some investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are part of her investment strategy and may not directly influence the overall market sentiment towards Apple. The company's strong fundamentals, product releases, and overall market conditions will likely have a more significant influence on its long-term performance. Given the information, there is a slightly higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but the overall market conditions and other influencing factors should also be considered.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Nancy Pelosi selling Apple shares can be seen as a bearish signal, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and market fundamentals might mitigate the negative impact. Considering the track record of Pelosi's trades and the market's potential reaction, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise. The news does not mention any specific negative or positive developments about Apple directly, apart from Pelosi's selling actions. Weighing these factors and the overall market conditions, the estimated probabilities are derived.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent sale of a significant number of Apple shares can be interpreted as a negative signal by investors, potentially leading to short-term stock price movements. Although insider selling is often viewed negatively, other factors such as Apple's strong market fundamentals, consistent product innovation, and robust sales remain unchanged. Moreover, previous predictions show a recurring theme of slightly higher probabilities of a stock price fall. However, a prolonged fall would require more direct negative signals impacting the broader company performance or market conditions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's significant sale of Apple shares can be perceived as a negative signal by investors, particularly given her track record of successful trades. This information, combined with the broader concerns surrounding insider selling and public debates about congressional stock trading, could put downward pressure on the stock. However, it's important to consider Apple's strong market fundamentals, brand strength, and previous performance, which may mitigate the immediate impact of this news. The consensus among predictions has demonstrated a pattern of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall post-news, suggesting that while there is increased bearish sentiment, the overall strength of Apple may prevent a drastic decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The consistent interpretation of Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares as a bearish signal across previous rounds and by various models suggests a persistent negative sentiment. While Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the market often reacts to insider trading activity, particularly when it involves a figure whose trades are closely followed, like Pelosi. The fact that the sale occurred earlier mitigates the impact somewhat, but the perceived lack of confidence can still put downward pressure on the stock. Considering the existing bearish sentiment and the lack of significantly positive offsetting news, reinforces the higher likelihood of a stock price fall. However, strong fundamentals and a possibility of overreaction limits the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares is the primary news item. While insider selling can be a bearish signal, the sale occurred on December 31st, so the market likely already partially factored this into the price.  Apple's strong fundamentals and market position mitigate the negative impact of this single event.  The previous predictions overwhelmingly point to a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but the consensus consistently places the probability of a fall only slightly above 0.5. The broad agreement across multiple models underscores a degree of uncertainty, with the sale acting as a slight negative influence rather than a significant catalyst for a major price movement.  Given the previous rounds' analysis and the fact that the news is already somewhat priced in, I am adjusting the prediction slightly toward a more balanced probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile political figure, sold a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which could be perceived as a negative signal by the market. Historically, large insider sales can influence investor sentiment negatively, especially when coming from a figure with a track record of successful trades. While Apple's strong fundamentals and market position may mitigate some of the downward pressure, the short-term impact of this news is likely to skew towards a negative reaction. Previous predictions also leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reinforcing this view. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising in the immediate aftermath of this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which could be interpreted as a negative signal by some investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. While Pelosi's trades don't inherently predict market movements, her actions are closely watched, and her sale of Apple shares on December 31st could contribute to a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's strong fundamentals, including its market position and product performance, are likely to mitigate the impact. Previous predictions have consistently shown a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7, with an average leaning towards a slight decrease. Considering these factors, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news about Nancy Pelosi selling Apple shares can be seen as a bearish signal, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and market fundamentals might mitigate the negative impact. Considering the track record of Pelosi's trades and the market's potential reaction, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise. The overall market conditions, company-specific factors, and the fact that the sale has already occurred on December 31st, which might have been partially priced into the current stock value, are also taken into account. Weighing these factors, the estimated probabilities are derived.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple shares. Historically, such sales by high-profile individuals, especially when they are associated with strong performance, can influence market sentiment negatively. However, Apple has a strong market presence, solid fundamentals, and consistent innovation, which may partly offset the negative implications. The repeated patterns from previous predictions suggest a consistent belief in higher probabilities of a price fall post such events. Hence, weighing both historical precedence and the company\u2019s robust position in the market, while the negative sentiment is present, it is not expected to drastically affect long-term prospects.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the recent news regarding Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant amount of Apple shares suggests a prevailing negative sentiment among investors. Historically, substantial insider sales, particularly by high-profile figures, are perceived as bearish signals and can lead to downward price pressure. Despite this, Apple's strong market fundamentals and brand presence offer some mitigation against drastic declines. The predictions from various models indicate a consistent pattern of higher probabilities for a price fall following such news. Overall, the combination of negative sentiment from the insider selling and the robust fundamentals leads to the conclusion that while there is a higher likelihood of a price fall, it may not result in extreme movements.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consistent trend across previous rounds indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding Apple (AAPL) due to Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant number of shares. While Apple's robust fundamentals are acknowledged, the market's reaction to insider trading activity, particularly by a closely-followed figure like Pelosi, tends to exert downward pressure. The fact that the sale occurred in late December suggests that its impact may already be partially priced in. However, acknowledging the consistent downward probability bias, and that there has been no strong offseting piece of information about AAPL to cause people to change their bearish viewpoint, I am adjusting my prediction to still reflect the trend. I am increasing the fall probability to 0.7 due to the lack of any change in positive sentiment toward AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news of Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple stock is the primary driver of the analysis.  While this could be interpreted as a bearish signal, several mitigating factors exist. First, the sale occurred on December 31st, so the market likely already partially priced this information.  Second, Apple possesses strong fundamentals and a resilient market position.  Third, the consistent predictions across multiple rounds show a clustering of probabilities around a slight increase in the probability of a price fall, generally ranging from 0.55 to 0.7, but never exceeding a dramatically high probability of a fall, suggesting a muted impact.  Considering the already-priced-in effect, the robust fundamentals of Apple, and the consensus prediction of a modest downward pressure (but not a significant drop), I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this more nuanced outlook. The overall sentiment remains slightly bearish, but the magnitude of the potential impact is limited.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple Inc.
