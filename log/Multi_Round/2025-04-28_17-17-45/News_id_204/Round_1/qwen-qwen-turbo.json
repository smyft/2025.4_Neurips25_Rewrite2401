(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge.

The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock sales that preceded a Department of Justice lawsuit against the company.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares can be interpreted as a bearish signal, as significant insider selling often raises concerns among investors. However, the impact of such a trade on the overall market sentiment regarding Apple may be mitigated by the broader context, including the performance of their products and financial standing. The news might lead to increased skepticism in the short term, but given Apple's strong brand and market fundamentals, the stock might not fall drastically. Therefore, while the probability of a price fall increases due to the news of the sale, the overall strength of Apple's position in the market maintains a reasonable probability of price stability or a slight rise in the longer term if investor sentiment remains resilient. Ultimately, the probabilities are derived by weighing both the negative signal from the sell-off against the prevailing positive fundamentals of the company.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple (AAPL) stock. While Pelosi's trades have garnered attention and sometimes outperform the market, her actions don't automatically guarantee a specific stock price movement. The potential negative impact of a large sale of AAPL stock described in this article is somewhat balanced by the fact that this happened in the recent past (Dec 31st). Therefore, its influence has been somewhat included in the current market price. However, the negative sentiment of the sale and how people potentially react to the sale need to be considered. Hence, there is a slightly increased probability of a stock price fall. Also, broader market conditions and company-specific factors will significantly impact the price. So while the news might exert some pressure, the potential for the stock to maintain or slightly increase is still there. Overall sentiment can potentially push it down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple stock. While Pelosi's trades don't inherently predict market movements, the sale of a large holding by a prominent figure can be interpreted by some investors as a negative signal, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock price. However, this effect is likely to be relatively small compared to broader market factors and Apple's own performance.  The article also highlights that a Pelosi stock tracker had high returns in 2024, which could be interpreted by some as adding weight to the trades made by Pelosi. In contrast, it also mentions criticism of her trading activity and calls for stricter regulation, which may not directly affect AAPL but might highlight investor uncertainty. Overall, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, with the probability of a price decrease being slightly higher than the probability of an increase, though neither is likely to be significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term performance. Given Pelosi's track record of successful trades, her actions might influence market sentiment negatively for AAPL. However, Apple is a large-cap stock with strong fundamentals, and Pelosi's sale might not have a substantial long-term impact. The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the potential short-term negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi, a prominent political figure, has sold her shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and has instead invested in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The sale of Apple shares by a high-profile investor like Pelosi might be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, it is essential to note that stock movements are influenced by a myriad of factors, and Pelosi\u2019s actions alone may not dictate the stock's direction. Given the information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but the overall market conditions and other influencing factors should also be considered.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, as disclosed in the news, could be perceived as a negative signal by some investors, potentially leading to a decrease in the stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's trades, including her recent purchase of Alphabet and Amazon calls, are part of her investment strategy and may not directly influence the overall market sentiment towards Apple. The news may have a short-term impact on the stock price, but the company's fundamentals, product releases, and overall market conditions will likely have a more significant influence on its long-term performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's recent trades indicate she disposed a significant amount of Apple shares on Dec 31. While individual trades by political figures do not necessarily predict market movements, they can be interpreted as signs of confidence or lack thereof in those companies. There is no specific positive or negative news about Apple Inc directly mentioned in the article apart from her selling actions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
