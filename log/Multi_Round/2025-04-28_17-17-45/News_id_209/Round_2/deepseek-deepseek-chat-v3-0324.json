(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates a notable decline in Apple's stock, driven by a downgrade from Jefferies analysts and evidence of weak iPhone sales expectations. Key points include a 4% drop in stock price, a downgraded analyst rating, and disappointing forecast for upcoming iPhone models, which may suggest ongoing negative sentiment among investors. Given these factors, the likelihood of Apple's stock price continuing to fall seems high, while the probability of it rising appears low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple (AAPL). Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization highlights a shift in investor sentiment. The Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" coupled with weak iPhone 17/18 sales expectations and cautiousness regarding the iPhone SE 4 suggests potential revenue declines and reduced investor confidence. The analyst's note directly cited concerns over consumer adoption of Apple Intelligence and potential consumer preference for older iPhone models over the SE4. Furthermore, reported declines in iPhone shipments, particularly in China, strengthen the bearish view. Taking all of this into account, the chances of a stock price decrease are higher than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article highlights a significant downgrade of Apple's stock by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales, particularly the iPhone 17 and 18, and concerns about the upcoming iPhone SE 4.  The analysts point to limited hardware upgrades, weak demand in China, and the potential attractiveness of used iPhones as factors contributing to this weak outlook.  The fact that Apple's market cap was overtaken by Nvidia further supports a bearish sentiment. While there's always the possibility of a market correction or positive unexpected news, the current information overwhelmingly points towards a negative short-term outlook for AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors impacting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a recent downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform' due to expected weak sales for upcoming iPhone models and disappointing fiscal results. Additionally, iPhone shipments have declined year-over-year, particularly in China, which is a critical market for Apple. The overall sentiment in the news is bearish, as Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day of the news and is down 9% year-to-date. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price has slipped, allowing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable company. The content further explains that Apple's shares fell by almost 4% due to a downgrade by Jefferies analysts, who cited expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. This negative sentiment and the actual stock price drop suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports a decline in Apple's stock price and a downgrade in its rating by Jefferies analysts, citing weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. The analysts also express caution over demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4. This negative sentiment and decline in market capitalization suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the comparison with Nvidia, which has reclaimed its title as the world's most valuable public company, further puts downward pressure on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued downward trend for Apple's stock due to multiple factors such as a downgrade by Jefferies, weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales expectations, and potential issues with the upcoming iPhone SE 4. Additionally, there is cautious outlook on iPhone sales and shipments, especially in China. These factors suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates significant bearish sentiment driven by a downgrade from Jefferies analysts and expectations of weak sales for upcoming iPhone models. The company's stock has already fallen by nearly 4% and is down over 9% year-to-date. With concerns over iPhone shipments, particularly in the critical Chinese market, and a shift in market capitalization as Nvidia surpasses Apple, the likelihood of further declines in Apple's stock price is strong, as multiple analysts predict a negative outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple's market cap is a significant event that reflects investor sentiment shifting away from Apple. The downgrade by Jefferies, with explicit mentions of weak iPhone sales forecasts (iPhone 17/18, SE 4), paints a bleak picture. The concerns regarding the iPhone SE 4 potentially underperforming even older models like the iPhone 13 due to a lack of compelling features is another red flag. The drop in iPhone shipments, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, further corroborates the bearish outlook. The previous rounds indicate a consistent negative prediction, with probabilities of stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.85. Therefore, it makes sense to adjust the probability slightly closer to these values, putting more weight on the consistent negative analyst sentiment and market data. Although market bounces can happen there is nothing in this new that indicates that this bounce will happen for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.18, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.82, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  A significant stock price drop of almost 4% accompanied the release of the news, and a downgrade to \"Underperform\" by Jefferies analysts further reinforces the bearish sentiment.  Jefferies' concerns about weak iPhone sales (particularly the iPhone 17 and 18 and the anticipated SE 4) and the disappointing performance in the crucial Chinese market strongly suggest continued downward pressure. The fact that Nvidia surpassed Apple in market capitalization underscores a shift in investor confidence. While there's always a possibility of a market correction or unexpected positive news, the current information points towards a higher probability of a continued price decline in the short term. The previous predictions also heavily favor a price drop, ranging from 0.7 to 0.85 probability.  Considering all these factors, a slightly more conservative estimate than the previous predictions is warranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors impacting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a recent downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform' due to expected weak sales for upcoming iPhone models, disappointing fiscal results, and declining iPhone shipments, particularly in China. The overall sentiment in the news is bearish, as Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day of the news and is down 9% year-to-date. Given these factors and the consensus from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling appears significantly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock price fell by almost 4% due to a downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales expectations, limited hardware upgrades for iPhone 17 and 18, and cautiousness over the iPhone SE 4. Additionally, iPhone shipments have declined year-over-year, particularly in China. The fact that Nvidia reclaimed its title as the world's most valuable public company further highlights the negative sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising appears low, while the probability of it falling seems high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights multiple negative factors affecting Apple's stock, including a downgrade by Jefferies analysts, weak iPhone sales expectations, and a decline in market capitalization. The analysts' concerns over limited hardware upgrades, weak demand in China, and the potential attractiveness of used iPhones further support a bearish sentiment. Additionally, the fact that Nvidia has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable public company adds to the downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Considering these factors and the overall trend of previous predictions, which mostly indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Jefferies analysts, expected weak iPhone sales for upcoming models, and weak iPhone shipment numbers, especially in China. The market perception is significantly influenced by these indicators of declining performance and reduced investment confidence. Given the consistent negative sentiments across recent predictions from various models, it seems there is a high level of consensus that the stock price will continue to fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
