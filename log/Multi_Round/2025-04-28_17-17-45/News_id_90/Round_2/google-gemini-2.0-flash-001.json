(AAPL)\nNews Headline: The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Microsoft\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Apple Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAppleis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nApple expects the December quarter's (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAAPL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\n\nLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple's fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion.\n\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple's installed base has been a concern.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL's Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple's Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple's Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple's estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC's vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo's growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies and HP saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies' 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple's market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\n\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner's list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 27.5%.\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple's AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \"Magnificent 7\" group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple's stringent privacy standards.\n\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple's near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. indicates several factors that could impact its stock price. The upcoming Q1 earnings report is a crucial event, and while there is expected revenue growth, the decline in iPhone sales\u2014a key revenue driver\u2014poses a risk. Meanwhile, growth in the Services segment and favorable momentum in Mac shipments may provide some support. However, the market is reacting to concerns about competitive pressures in China and general valuation stretched relative to peers. Given the current Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), the sentiment appears negative, suggesting a higher probability of a decline than an increase in stock price in the immediate term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This analysis considers several factors. While Apple's overall expected revenue and EPS growth are positive (3.73% and 8.26% respectively), a projected decline in iPhone sales (-0.7%) is a significant concern. China competition and a delayed AI launch contribute further negative pressure. The positive growth in Services (projected +13.2%) and Mac sales (+17.3% shipment increase) partially offset this. Zacks's current Rank #4 (Sell) reinforces a bearish outlook. Comparing Apple's past performance to the overall performance of the Zacks Computer & Technology sector paints a picture of underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, I weigh the negative pressure slightly higher, leading to a higher probability of a fall in the stock price. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 will provide critical context, and this is a pre-earnings estimate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Zacks analyst blog presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q1 revenue is expected to grow slightly and the Services segment shows strong growth potential, concerns exist regarding slowing iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) strongly suggests a negative outlook.  However, growth in the Mac segment and the potential long-term benefits of Apple Intelligence mitigate some of the negative factors. Considering the overall mixed signals, with significant downside risk highlighted by the Zacks rating and China headwinds, a price fall is more likely in the short term, though not guaranteed.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news reveals mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. On the positive side, Apple is expected to show revenue growth, albeit modest (3.73% YoY), and earnings growth (8.26% YoY), with a consistent track record of beating EPS estimates. The Services segment is anticipated to grow steadily (13.2% YoY), and the Mac sales are expected to increase significantly (17.3% YoY). Additionally, Apple's focus on AI with Apple Intelligence could bolster long-term prospects. However, there are significant concerns: iPhone sales are projected to decline (0.7% YoY) due to competition in China, the stock is currently overvalued (forward P/E of 28.97X vs. sector's 27.54X), and the company faces regulatory and competitive headwinds in China. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation further dampens sentiment. Given these factors, the news presents a balanced but slightly negative outlook ahead of earnings.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its Q1 earnings on January 30. The company's revenue is expected to grow low to mid-single digits year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. However, iPhone sales are likely to fall due to stiff competition in China, which could negatively impact the stock price. On the other hand, the Services segment is expected to grow steadily, with a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. Apple's AI push with Apple Intelligence is expected to improve its competitive position in the long run. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector, returning 16.2% compared to 27.5% for the sector. Given these mixed factors, the stock price movement seems uncertain but with a slightly higher chance of falling due to short-term concerns like weak iPhone sales and competition in China.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report, with expectations of low to mid-single digit revenue growth. The article highlights the potential decline in iPhone sales due to stiff competition in China, but also notes the steady growth of the Services segment. Additionally, Apple's AI push and expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ are seen as positive factors. However, the article assigns a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) to Apple, indicating a stretched valuation and near-term risks, particularly in China.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there's a focus on strong services growth and the potential for Apple Intelligence to drive future growth. On the other hand, concerns around iPhone sales declines and valuation challenges in the short term indicate potential headwinds. Moreover, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggests a cautious view on the stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings report shows a mixed outlook. While there is expected revenue and earnings growth, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China is a significant concern. The report highlights positive growth in the Services segment, which may partially offset weaknesses in iPhone sales, but the overall sentiment is weighed down by a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This suggests greater investor caution and may lead to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to price rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock price amidst the current uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The previous rounds have consistently leaned towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling, driven primarily by concerns about declining iPhone sales due to competition in China and a generally stretched valuation despite growth in Services and Mac segments. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) remains a significant bearish indicator across rounds. While Apple's AI initiatives offer long-term potential, immediate concerns regarding iPhone sales and short to mid term economic pressures carry strong weight.\n\nGiven the established sentiment and the absence of significantly new positive information and that we are close to earnings with multiple analysts' pointing this out, I'm adjusting the probabilities slighly to more bearish side as this seems to be a more stable expectation for imminent price changes.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While positive factors exist, such as expected revenue and earnings growth, strong Services segment performance, and the potential long-term benefits of Apple Intelligence, significant concerns overshadow them.  The projected decline in iPhone sales due to Chinese competition is a major red flag.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the relatively high valuation further contribute to a negative sentiment. The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7. Considering all factors, including the consensus of previous predictions and the significant near-term risks, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. Positive factors include expected revenue growth (3.73% YoY), steady growth in the Services segment (13.2% YoY), and strong Mac sales (17.3% YoY). Additionally, Apple's AI push with Apple Intelligence could bolster long-term prospects. However, significant concerns include a projected decline in iPhone sales (-0.7% YoY) due to competition in China, a stretched valuation (forward P/E of 28.97X vs. sector's 27.54X), and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation. Given these mixed signals, the stock price movement appears uncertain but leans slightly negative due to short-term headwinds.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) reveals mixed signals. On the positive side, the company is expected to report low to mid-single digit revenue growth in Q1 2025, with the Services segment anticipated to grow steadily at a double-digit rate. Additionally, Apple's focus on AI with Apple Intelligence could enhance its long-term prospects. However, concerns exist regarding a projected decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China, a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further supports a cautious view. Considering these factors, the outlook appears slightly negative in the short term, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the news surrounding Apple Inc. indicates mixed signals for the company's stock price ahead of its Q1 earnings report. Positive factors include expected revenue growth, steady growth in the Services segment, and significant growth in Mac sales. However, concerns about a decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China, a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence, and a stretched valuation relative to the sector are notable negatives. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further suggests a cautious outlook. Considering these factors and the predictions from previous rounds, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to short-term concerns, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced but slightly negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are positive aspects such as expected revenue growth, growth in the Services segment, and the potential for long-term benefits from Apple Intelligence, there are significant concerns including a decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and the current overvaluation. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation reinforces a bearish sentiment. These mixed signals suggest a balanced outlook, but with a slight tilt towards a negative sentiment due to significant short-term concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
