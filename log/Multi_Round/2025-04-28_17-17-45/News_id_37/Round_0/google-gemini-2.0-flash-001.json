(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple reports record earnings, but misses on iPhone estimates\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) met Wall Street\u2019s expectations with fiscal first-quarter earnings driven by the holiday season.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenues of $124.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 \u2014 a 4% increase year over year. Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While the company reported record overall earnings and met revenue expectations, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, a critical segment. The initial after-hours surge suggests investors reacted positively to the overall earnings and future growth guidance. However, the Jefferies downgrade citing weak future iPhone sales and the lack of traction for current AI features introduce a significant negative factor. The market's initial enthusiasm might cool down as investors further digest the iPhone miss and the potential impact of negative analyst sentiment. The provided detail that shares are down 0.74% at market close on Thursday and are down by 5.1% so far this year shows the stock has been performing weakly, making downward momentum potentially stronger. Weighing these factors, the positive aspects (record earnings and growth guidance) are somewhat offset by the iPhone revenue miss and negative analyst sentiment. Apple Intelligence is said to have yet to gain traction with consumers so the overall positive and negative factors are somewhat balanced, giving slightly more weight to the fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple reports record earnings, but misses on iPhone estimates\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
