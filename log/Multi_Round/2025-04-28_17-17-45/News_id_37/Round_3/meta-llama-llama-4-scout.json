(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple reports record earnings, but misses on iPhone estimates\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) met Wall Street\u2019s expectations with fiscal first-quarter earnings driven by the holiday season.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenues of $124.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 \u2014 a 4% increase year over year. Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported strong earnings, meeting the expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share, which is positive. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which raises concerns about future sales particularly as it may indicate weakening demand for iPhones. Despite the positive guidance for low to mid single-digit growth for the next quarter and a rise in after-hours trading, the downgrade from Jefferies and the negative outlook for iPhone sales suggests bearish sentiment. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to good earnings results, while the probability of a fall is also significant due to the missed iPhone revenue estimates.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the company reported record overall earnings and met revenue expectations, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, a critical segment. The initial after-hours surge suggests investors reacted positively to the overall earnings and future growth guidance. However, the Jefferies downgrade citing weak future iPhone sales and the lack of traction for current AI features introduce a significant negative factor. The market's initial enthusiasm might cool down as investors further digest the iPhone miss and the potential impact of negative analyst sentiment. The provided detail that shares are down 0.74% at market close on Thursday and are down by 5.1% so far this year shows the stock has been performing weakly, making downward momentum potentially stronger. Weighing these factors, the positive aspects (record earnings and growth guidance) are somewhat offset by the iPhone revenue miss and negative analyst sentiment. Apple Intelligence is said to have yet to gain traction with consumers so the overall positive and negative factors are somewhat balanced, giving slightly more weight to the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings, exceeding expectations on revenue and EPS. However, iPhone sales missed expectations, and guidance for the next quarter also fell short of analyst predictions.  While the exceeding overall earnings initially pushed the stock price up in after-hours trading, the miss on iPhone sales and weaker-than-expected guidance are significant negative factors. Jefferies' prior downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales further contribute to a bearish outlook. The positive news of record earnings is counterbalanced by the negative news of missed iPhone sales targets and conservative guidance, creating uncertainty.  The overall market sentiment (down 5.1% YTD) also plays a role. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings with revenues of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase YoY, and earnings per share of $2.41, which met Wall Street expectations. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates ($69.1 billion vs. expected $70.7 billion). Despite this, the stock price rose by more than 3% in after-hours trading due to positive guidance for the March quarter ('low to mid single digits' growth). The market's reaction seems to outweigh the iPhone miss, likely because of the overall strong performance and future growth prospects. The downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over iPhone SE 4 demand may have some negative impact, but the immediate reaction is positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's record earnings, which meets Wall Street's expectations, driven by the holiday season. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates. Despite this, Apple's guidance for the March quarter is expected to be 'low to mid single digits' growth, which is somewhat positive. The stock price was up by more than 3% in after-hours trading, indicating a positive initial reaction to the news. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate due to the mixed nature of the earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. Additionally, the guidance for the next quarter suggests low to mid-single digit growth, which could be seen as modest compared to previous quarters. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings and met overall revenue and EPS expectations, which are positive indicators for investor sentiment. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, a critical part of its business, which raises concerns about future sales growth. The mixed signals from the earnings report, combined with recent analyst downgrades and caution regarding the iPhone SE 4's demand, yield uncertainty in the market. The stock's positive reaction in after-hours trading suggests some optimism, yet the potential for negative sentiment regarding the missed iPhone sales and weaker-than-expected guidance cannot be overlooked. Balancing these factors leads to a more modest estimate of upward movement likelihood compared to the potential for downward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: Apple's financial news presents a mixed bag. Record earnings and meeting overall revenue expectations are strong positives, initially reflected in the after-hours trading surge. The \"low to mid single digits\" growth guidance for the March quarter also adds to investor optimism. However, the significant miss in iPhone revenue estimates is a red flag, as iPhones remain a core revenue driver. Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak future iPhone sales due to limited hardware upgrades and slow adoption of Apple Intelligence, further dampens the outlook. Considering the others' estimations the trend seems to be adjusting towards a neutral viewpoint on the stock. Given all these factors, I'm slightly leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, factoring in the strong earnings and forward guidance, but significantly weighting downside risk from the iPhone revenue miss and negative analyst sentiment..\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: Apple's mixed earnings report presents a complex picture. While exceeding overall revenue and EPS expectations is positive, the missed iPhone sales target is a significant negative. This miss, combined with a cautious outlook and the Jefferies downgrade, creates uncertainty. The initial after-hours surge suggests some positive sentiment towards overall performance and future growth, but the longer-term impact is unclear.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most models slightly favoring a price fall or a roughly even split. Considering the mixed signals and particularly the importance of iPhone sales to Apple's overall performance, I lean slightly toward a greater probability of a price fall, although the overall certainty is low.  The 3%+ after-hours jump is a mitigating factor but the significant number of negative indicators counters this. The year-to-date performance of the stock being down by 5.1% also suggests there's downward pressure, reinforcing a more pessimistic outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple reported record earnings, meeting Wall Street's expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share, and provided guidance for low to mid-single-digit growth in the next quarter, which initially led to a 3% rise in after-hours trading. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, a critical segment, and faces concerns from analysts like Jefferies about weak future iPhone sales and limited traction for new AI features. The stock has also been underperforming year-to-date, down 5.1%. Given these mixed signals\u2014strong overall earnings but weak iPhone performance and bearish analyst sentiment\u2014the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall. The initial after-hours surge may not fully offset the underlying concerns about iPhone demand and future growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings with revenues of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase YoY, and earnings per share of $2.41, which met Wall Street expectations. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical segment. The guidance for the next quarter is 'low to mid single digits' growth, which is modest. Despite the positive guidance, the miss on iPhone sales and concerns over future demand and hardware upgrades could weigh on investor sentiment. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and negative outlook for iPhone sales also introduce a significant bearish factor. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with a cautious outlook due to the iPhone revenue miss and downgraded guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple, with record earnings but a miss on iPhone revenue estimates. The company's guidance for the March quarter is somewhat positive, with expected 'low to mid single digits' growth. Considering the mixed signals, the initial positive reaction in after-hours trading, and the negative sentiment from the Jefferies downgrade and concerns over iPhone sales, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than the probability of falling. The overall market sentiment, with shares down 5.1% so far this year, also contributes to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share, which is a strong positive signal. On the other hand, they missed iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. This miss could potentially indicate weakening demand for iPhones. Although the company's shares saw a positive reaction in after-hours trading, suggesting temporary optimism, the guidance for modest growth in the next quarter and the recent downgrade from Jefferies add to the bearish sentiment. The probabilities reflect a balance between these factors, leaning slightly towards a potential decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: Apple's recent earnings report reflects a mixed outlook. The company achieved record revenues and met overall earnings expectations, which is a positive indicator. However, the miss on iPhone revenue estimates raises concerns about future sales, as the iPhone is a critical revenue driver for Apple. Despite positive after-hours trading reaction, the sentiment is tempered by a downgrade from Jefferies and mixed guidance for the upcoming quarter. Given these factors, while there is some momentum from the overall strong earnings, the concerns from missed expectations and negative analyst sentiment weigh heavily. Thus, the probabilities suggest a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising due to the unresolved concerns related to iPhone sales and overall market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 fiscal 2025 presented a mixed financial picture. Record overall earnings meeting expectations and positive growth guidance for the March quarter are bullish signals. The missed iPhone revenue, downgrade from Jefferies citing weak iPhone sales, and slow adoption of Apple Intelligence are bearish. Previous rounds show a shift toward a more bearish outlook with falling probability predictions. Given mixed signals, especially the missed iPhone estimates which carry substantial weight coupled with persistent concerns from analysts and the market sentiment, I'm leaning more bearish but taking other predictions and after-hours rise into account.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's earnings report presents a mixed bag. While record overall earnings and meeting revenue expectations are positive, the significant miss on iPhone revenue estimates is a major concern. This is compounded by Jefferies' downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales and the slow adoption of Apple Intelligence.  The positive initial market reaction in after-hours trading suggests that investors are initially focused on the overall strong earnings and positive guidance, but the long-term impact is uncertain.  The previous predictions show a trend toward a more neutral or slightly bearish outlook. The year-to-date underperformance of the stock also points towards downward momentum.  Balancing the positive overall earnings with the negative iPhone sales miss and negative analyst sentiment, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall. The consensus of the previous models also points to a higher probability of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, but with a cautious outlook due to the iPhone revenue miss and downgraded guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) indicates mixed signals regarding the company's performance. On the positive side, Apple reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share. The company's guidance for the March quarter, expecting 'low to mid single digits' growth, also suggests optimism about future performance. However, the miss on iPhone revenue estimates, a critical segment for Apple, and the cautious outlook from analysts like Jefferies due to limited hardware upgrades and slow adoption of Apple Intelligence, introduce significant negative factors.

(AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met overall revenue and EPS expectations, which are strong positive indicators. The initial positive market response in after-hours trading suggests optimism around this overall strong performance. However, the company missed its iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical part of its business and could indicate potential concerns about future sales growth. Additionally, guidance for modest growth next quarter and the recent downgrade by Jefferies regarding weak iPhone sales also introduce negative factors. Considering these points and the trend of mixed predictions from previous rounds, the probabilities seem fairly balanced. However, given the importance of iPhone sales, the concern about the iPhone revenue miss, and the overall weak year-to-date performance, there is a slightly higher concern of a potential stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
