(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple reports record earnings, but misses on iPhone estimates\nNews Content: Apple CEO Tim Cook on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) met Wall Street\u2019s expectations with fiscal first-quarter earnings driven by the holiday season.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenues of $124.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 \u2014 a 4% increase year over year. Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple reported strong earnings, meeting the expectations for overall revenue and earnings per share, which is positive. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates, which raises concerns about future sales particularly as it may indicate weakening demand for iPhones. Despite the positive guidance for low to mid single-digit growth for the next quarter and a rise in after-hours trading, the downgrade from Jefferies and the negative outlook for iPhone sales suggests bearish sentiment. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high due to good earnings results, while the probability of a fall is also significant due to the missed iPhone revenue estimates.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the company reported record overall earnings and met revenue expectations, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, a critical segment. The initial after-hours surge suggests investors reacted positively to the overall earnings and future growth guidance. However, the Jefferies downgrade citing weak future iPhone sales and the lack of traction for current AI features introduce a significant negative factor. The market's initial enthusiasm might cool down as investors further digest the iPhone miss and the potential impact of negative analyst sentiment. The provided detail that shares are down 0.74% at market close on Thursday and are down by 5.1% so far this year shows the stock has been performing weakly, making downward momentum potentially stronger. Weighing these factors, the positive aspects (record earnings and growth guidance) are somewhat offset by the iPhone revenue miss and negative analyst sentiment. Apple Intelligence is said to have yet to gain traction with consumers so the overall positive and negative factors are somewhat balanced, giving slightly more weight to the fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings, exceeding expectations on revenue and EPS. However, iPhone sales missed expectations, and guidance for the next quarter also fell short of analyst predictions.  While the exceeding overall earnings initially pushed the stock price up in after-hours trading, the miss on iPhone sales and weaker-than-expected guidance are significant negative factors. Jefferies' prior downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales further contribute to a bearish outlook. The positive news of record earnings is counterbalanced by the negative news of missed iPhone sales targets and conservative guidance, creating uncertainty.  The overall market sentiment (down 5.1% YTD) also plays a role. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple reported record earnings with revenues of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase YoY, and earnings per share of $2.41, which met Wall Street expectations. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates ($69.1 billion vs. expected $70.7 billion). Despite this, the stock price rose by more than 3% in after-hours trading due to positive guidance for the March quarter ('low to mid single digits' growth). The market's reaction seems to outweigh the iPhone miss, likely because of the overall strong performance and future growth prospects. The downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over iPhone SE 4 demand may have some negative impact, but the immediate reaction is positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's record earnings, which meets Wall Street's expectations, driven by the holiday season. However, the company missed iPhone revenue estimates. Despite this, Apple's guidance for the March quarter is expected to be 'low to mid single digits' growth, which is somewhat positive. The stock price was up by more than 3% in after-hours trading, indicating a positive initial reaction to the news. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate due to the mixed nature of the earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company reported record earnings and met Wall Street's expectations for revenues and earnings per share. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which is a critical component of their business. Additionally, the guidance for the next quarter suggests low to mid-single digit growth, which could be seen as modest compared to previous quarters. The recent downgrade by Jefferies and concerns over hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
