(AAPL). Warren Buffett is a highly respected investor, and his substantial investment in AAPL could be perceived as a strong vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects. This news may lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL stock, potentially driving the price up. However, the impact might be moderate since Buffett's holdings in AAPL are already well-known, and the news does not introduce any new fundamental changes to the company. The probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but the effect may not be dramatic.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
