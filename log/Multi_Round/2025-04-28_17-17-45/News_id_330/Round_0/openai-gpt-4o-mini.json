Given Buffett's reputation as a value investor, this may signal strong confidence in these companies, which could positively influence investor sentiment. If Apple Inc. is one of the top holdings in Buffett's portfolio, this could lead to increased demand and a rise in stock price. However, without specific confirmation that Apple is one of those stocks, the impact is less certain. Based on this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising as a result of potential increased investor interest while acknowledging the risks involved.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nearly 66% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks as 2025 Begins\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}"
