(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Tom Forte acknowledges potential challenges in the iPhone upgrade cycle and has a Hold rating, he also points out that Apple's hybrid CapEx model offers some resilience compared to its peers. This suggests that while there are concerns about sales, particularly with potential mismatches in product rollouts, Apple's position in leveraging AI spending from other Big Tech companies could be beneficial. Overall, the cautious tone may lead to a slight increase in selling pressure, but the less vulnerable status may not lead to major declines.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollout could negatively impact iPhone sales, leading analyst Tom Forte to maintain a \"Hold\" rating and express uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. However, the article also highlights Apple's less vulnerable position in the AI race due to its hybrid capital expenditure model, allowing it to leverage the investments of other Big Tech players while spending less itself. This could be seen as a positive factor, mitigating the threat from rising AI companies. The downgraded ratings earlier in the week might put extra pressure on Apple. Considering these factors, the stock is likely to have a slightly higher probability of a slight fall, though news is fairly neutral overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive compared to other Big Tech companies facing challenges due to DeepSeek, a concern remains regarding the iPhone upgrade cycle's dependence on AI software integration.  The analyst's 'Hold' rating suggests neither strong bullish nor bearish sentiment. The uncertainty around the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of AI on it is a key factor.  While the reduced risk from DeepSeek is positive, it is not a strong enough driver to predict a significant price rise. The lack of clear positive catalysts from the AI boom, coupled with concerns about iPhone sales, points towards higher probability of sideways movement or a slight decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model, which makes it less vulnerable compared to other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft. The analyst maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, indicating uncertainty about a super-cycle or upgrade cycle driven by AI. The mixed sentiment (lack of clear positive catalysts but also less vulnerability to certain risks) suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price. However, the unique CapEx model could be seen as a modest positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending. The analyst, Tom Forte, has a Hold rating on Apple stock, citing concerns about an iPhone upgrade cycle and AI impact. He notes that Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable to threats like DeepSeek. The tone of the article is neutral, and there is no strongly positive or negative sentiment expressed about Apple's stock performance. Given this neutral stance and the lack of a clear catalyst for a significant stock price movement, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the article also mentions that the emergence of DeepSeek has negatively impacted several Big Tech names, and Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to this threat. Additionally, the analyst has a Hold rating on Apple stock, citing uncertainty about an iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. Taking these points into consideration, the overall sentiment of the news article seems neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple's stock performance and its position in the AI boom. The analyst, Tom Forte, maintains a Hold rating on AAPL, citing uncertainties surrounding an iPhone upgrade cycle and potential threats from AI advancements like DeepSeek. However, he notes that Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable compared to other tech giants. The overall sentiment seems cautious with no clear positive or negative signals.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While concerns exist regarding the iPhone upgrade cycle and a Hold rating from an analyst, the less aggressive CapEx model compared to peers positions Apple to weather the impact of AI-related threats like DeepSeek more effectively.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, from a 30% chance of rise to 55%.  The predominantly neutral sentiment and lack of a strong bullish or bearish catalyst point to a probability of price movement closer to neutral.  Considering the relatively even distribution of previous predictions and the mixed nature of the news, a slight bias toward a price fall is warranted due to the analyst's 'Hold' rating and uncertainty surrounding the iPhone upgrade cycle.
