(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Tom Forte acknowledges potential challenges in the iPhone upgrade cycle and has a Hold rating, he also points out that Apple's hybrid CapEx model offers some resilience compared to its peers. This suggests that while there are concerns about sales, particularly with potential mismatches in product rollouts, Apple's position in leveraging AI spending from other Big Tech companies could be beneficial. Overall, the cautious tone may lead to a slight increase in selling pressure, but the less vulnerable status may not lead to major declines.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollout could negatively impact iPhone sales, leading analyst Tom Forte to maintain a \"Hold\" rating and express uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. However, the article also highlights Apple's less vulnerable position in the AI race due to its hybrid capital expenditure model, allowing it to leverage the investments of other Big Tech players while spending less itself. This could be seen as a positive factor, mitigating the threat from rising AI companies. The downgraded ratings earlier in the week might put extra pressure on Apple. Considering these factors, the stock is likely to have a slightly higher probability of a slight fall, though news is fairly neutral overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive compared to other Big Tech companies facing challenges due to DeepSeek, a concern remains regarding the iPhone upgrade cycle's dependence on AI software integration.  The analyst's 'Hold' rating suggests neither strong bullish nor bearish sentiment. The uncertainty around the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of AI on it is a key factor.  While the reduced risk from DeepSeek is positive, it is not a strong enough driver to predict a significant price rise. The lack of clear positive catalysts from the AI boom, coupled with concerns about iPhone sales, points towards higher probability of sideways movement or a slight decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its hybrid capital expenditure model, which makes it less vulnerable compared to other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft. The analyst maintains a Hold rating on Apple stock, indicating uncertainty about a super-cycle or upgrade cycle driven by AI. The mixed sentiment (lack of clear positive catalysts but also less vulnerability to certain risks) suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price. However, the unique CapEx model could be seen as a modest positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI boom and its potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending. The analyst, Tom Forte, has a Hold rating on Apple stock, citing concerns about an iPhone upgrade cycle and AI impact. He notes that Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable to threats like DeepSeek. The tone of the article is neutral, and there is no strongly positive or negative sentiment expressed about Apple's stock performance. Given this neutral stance and the lack of a clear catalyst for a significant stock price movement, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the article also mentions that the emergence of DeepSeek has negatively impacted several Big Tech names, and Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to this threat. Additionally, the analyst has a Hold rating on Apple stock, citing uncertainty about an iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. Taking these points into consideration, the overall sentiment of the news article seems neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple's stock performance and its position in the AI boom. The analyst, Tom Forte, maintains a Hold rating on AAPL, citing uncertainties surrounding an iPhone upgrade cycle and potential threats from AI advancements like DeepSeek. However, he notes that Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable compared to other tech giants. The overall sentiment seems cautious with no clear positive or negative signals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, analyst Tom Forte's Hold rating reflects concerns about the timing mismatch in the iPhone upgrade cycle and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven super-cycle. However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model offers resilience against the pressures faced by other Big Tech companies. This indicates a stable position for Apple compared to its peers, which may provide some support for the stock price. The overall sentiment remains cautious with no strong catalysts pushing the stock significantly upward or downward. Based on these considerations, I estimate a probability of 0.5 for both rising and falling stock prices, reflecting a balanced outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple. While Apple's hybrid CapEx model offers some protection against the negative impacts of DeepSeek compared to other big tech companies (a positive), the analyst's 'Hold' rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle overshadow this positive aspect. The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent slightly bearish sentiment. Considering the trend from previous predictions also leans slightly toward 'fall', adjusting my probabilities accordingly seems reasonable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While concerns exist regarding the iPhone upgrade cycle and a Hold rating from an analyst, the less aggressive CapEx model compared to peers positions Apple to weather the impact of AI-related threats like DeepSeek more effectively.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, from a 30% chance of rise to 55%.  The predominantly neutral sentiment and lack of a strong bullish or bearish catalyst point to a probability of price movement closer to neutral.  Considering the relatively even distribution of previous predictions and the mixed nature of the news, a slight bias toward a price fall is warranted due to the analyst's 'Hold' rating and uncertainty surrounding the iPhone upgrade cycle. This outweighs the slightly positive aspect of Apple's less aggressive CapEx strategy.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating and expresses uncertainty about an iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI, he also highlights Apple's hybrid CapEx model as a strength that makes the company less vulnerable compared to peers like Meta and Microsoft. The emergence of DeepSeek has negatively impacted other Big Tech companies, but Apple's unique position allows it to leverage others' CapEx spending, which is a positive. However, the lack of clarity on a super-cycle or strong AI-driven upgrade cycle weighs on sentiment. Given the neutral to slightly cautious tone of the news and the Hold rating, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight bias toward a potential fall due to the lingering uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Analyst Tom Forte has a Hold rating on the stock, expressing uncertainty about an iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI. However, he highlights that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes it less vulnerable to threats like DeepSeek, which has negatively impacted other Big Tech companies. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive, as the potential to leverage AI spending from other Big Tech players could be beneficial. Despite concerns about iPhone sales and the AI upgrade cycle, Apple's unique position may mitigate significant declines. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards stability or minor fluctuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with both positive and negative factors influencing the potential stock price movement. On the positive side, Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable to threats like DeepSeek compared to other Big Tech companies. This could be seen as a positive factor, mitigating potential declines. However, concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of AI on it, along with the analyst's 'Hold' rating, suggest caution and uncertainty. Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of clear positive catalysts from the AI boom, the estimated probabilities lean slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price. The previous predictions from other models also suggest a range of opinions, from a slight increase in selling pressure to a balanced view of the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling. Taking these factors into account, a balanced estimate of the probabilities seems reasonable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed signals regarding Apple's stock performance and its position in the AI boom. The analyst, Tom Forte, maintains a Hold rating on AAPL, citing uncertainties surrounding an iPhone upgrade cycle and potential threats from AI advancements like DeepSeek. However, he notes that Apple's hybrid CapEx model makes it less vulnerable compared to other tech giants. The overall sentiment seems cautious with no clear positive or negative signals. Previous predictions suggest a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline due to the cautious tone set by the Hold rating and some lingering worries about iPhone sales.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Analyst Tom Forte's Hold rating indicates a cautious sentiment, reflecting concerns about the timing mismatch in the iPhone upgrade cycle and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven super-cycle. However, Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model offers resilience compared to its peers, making it less vulnerable to threats from emerging AI competitors like DeepSeek. This aspect could provide some support for the stock price. The overall sentiment remains cautious, with no strong catalysts pushing the stock significantly upward or downward, leading to a balanced outlook for both rising and falling probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook, contributing to uncertainty regarding Apple's stock price movement. The analyst's \"Hold\" rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle remain significant bearish signals. However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model mitigating risks posed by DeepSeek and its ability to leverage other Big Tech companies' AI spending offer some bullish counterpoints. Considering the prevailing slightly negative sentiment from previous rounds, the continued mixed signals suggest a conservative approach. While Apple's resilience provides a safety net, the iPhone uncertainty makes a price increase less likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst's 'Hold' rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle suggest caution, Apple's hybrid CapEx model offers a degree of insulation from the AI-related challenges facing other tech giants.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, clustering around a slightly higher likelihood of a price fall than a rise.  However, the consistent presence of some positive counterpoints in the analysis (Apple's CapEx strategy and leveraged AI spending) prevents an overwhelmingly pessimistic view.  Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of a strong catalyst for significant movement in either direction, a probability slightly favoring a price fall reflects the overall cautious outlook but acknowledges the mitigating factors present in Apple's position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating, indicating uncertainty about an iPhone upgrade cycle driven by AI, which is a negative signal. However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model is highlighted as a strength, making the company less vulnerable compared to peers like Meta and Microsoft, which is a positive. The emergence of DeepSeek has negatively impacted other Big Tech companies, but Apple's unique position allows it to leverage others' CapEx spending, mitigating some risks. Given the neutral to slightly cautious tone of the news and the Hold rating, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight bias toward a potential fall due to lingering uncertainties. Previous predictions also show a trend toward a slightly higher probability of a fall, reinforcing this cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

(AAPL). Analyst Tom Forte's 'Hold' rating reflects concerns about the timing mismatch in the iPhone upgrade cycle and builds uncertainty about a super-cycle driven by AI. While Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model provides some resilience, making it less vulnerable to threats from competitors such as DeepSeek, the lack of clear positive catalysts keeps the sentiment cautious. Previous predictions indicate a trend towards a slight bias in favor of a stock price decline due to these mixed factors and uncertainty, but a relatively balanced outlook remains. Overall, my estimation reflects a slight preference for a potential decline based on the cautious sentiment expressed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.46, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.54, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Analyst Tom Forte maintains a Hold rating, raising concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and its dependence on AI, which is a bearish indicator. He also highlights Apple's hybrid CapEx model as a strength, enabling them to leverage other companies' AI spending, which is a bullish indicator. The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on other Big Tech companies is a general market risk, but Apple is positioned to be less vulnerable. The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent trend of slightly favoring a price fall. Considering the mixed signals and the analyst's 'Hold' rating, along with the trend from previous predictions, I'm slightly favoring a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst's 'Hold' rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle are bearish, Apple's unique hybrid CapEx model and ability to leverage other Big Tech's AI spending offer some resilience to the negative impacts of AI competition. This makes a significant price movement in either direction seem unlikely.  The consistent slightly bearish sentiment from previous prediction rounds, along with the analyst's caution, suggests a greater probability of a slight price decline than a rise. However, the mitigating factors prevent a strong bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
