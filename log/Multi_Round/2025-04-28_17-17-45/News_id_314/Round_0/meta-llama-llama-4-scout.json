However, such headlines often do not provide concrete financial data or analysis to support the claim. The article likely discusses Apple's historical performance and growth potential, which could positively influence investor sentiment. Given that the news is generally positive and encouraging, it is likely to boost investor confidence. However, the lack of specific details or new information might limit the immediate impact on the stock price. Based on this, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to increased investor confidence, but also consider that the market could be skeptical of sensational headlines.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Could Investing $1,000 in Apple Make You a Millionaire?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
