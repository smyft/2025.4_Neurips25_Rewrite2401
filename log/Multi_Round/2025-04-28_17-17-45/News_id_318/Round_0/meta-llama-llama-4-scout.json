Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news. However, as a major tech company, AAPL's stock price can be indirectly affected by regulatory news impacting the tech industry. Given that TikTok is a competitor in the digital space and the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business or operations, the impact is likely to be minimal. However, if TikTok were to be banned, it could potentially benefit Apple by reducing competition in the app store or shifting user attention to other platforms like Instagram or Snapchat, which are already established competitors. The indirect nature of this news suggests a low probability of significant stock price movement directly attributed to this TikTok-related news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45,\n}\n```"
