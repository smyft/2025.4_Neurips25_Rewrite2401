(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.
