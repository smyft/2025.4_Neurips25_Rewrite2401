(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news focuses on the importance of AI-related capital expenditure (capex) for Big Tech companies, including Apple. While not directly mentioning Apple's earnings or capex guidance, the article highlights that CEO commentary and commitment to AI development (and specifically, access to Nvidia chips) is very important to investors. The expert's comments indicate that strong commitment and aggressive capex plans related to AI are generally being received positively by the markets. However, there is uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's AI model and its affects on competition, which introduces some potential volatility. Since the main focus is on CEO commentary, and Apple hasn't yet reported, this information is largely neutral until Apple actually releases its earning results. Thus, the effect on Apple is speculative to the news, but still relevant to the overall market sentiment around big tech. Therefore, the short-term price movement is likely to be neutral. However, because the article also mentions Apple's competitors (Microsoft, Meta, IBM) and their AI commitments, strong news on this front would positively impact the whole sector, which would likely include Apple. Overall, I see better chances of a rise than a fall here because the general sentiment will be bullish if Apple is commited to competing in the AI race.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
