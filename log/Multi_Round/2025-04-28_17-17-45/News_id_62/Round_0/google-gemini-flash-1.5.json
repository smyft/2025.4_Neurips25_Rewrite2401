(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

While Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the earnings announcements, the article highlights the importance of CEO commentary regarding AI investments and high-end chip spending (like NVIDIA's) for the overall tech sector.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, pending further details on AI model efficiency and corporate commitment to AI development.  Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector and heavily invested in AI, the market's reaction to the other companies' announcements and statements about AI capex could indirectly impact Apple's stock price.  A positive overall sentiment in the tech sector due to strong AI investment plans and confident CEO commentary could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, a negative sentiment might lead to a fall.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the overall cautious optimism, I'm assigning moderate probabilities.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
