      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that there is a strong focus on earnings results and CEO commentary regarding capital expenditures (CapEx) and AI investments, which could positively influence investor sentiment. Apple, being one of the major tech companies, may see a rise in stock price if the general sentiment around CapEx and AI remains positive. However, uncertainty regarding earnings and the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates introduces a cautious element. Overall, the prevailing optimism about tech spending, combined with the uncertainty, leads to a moderate probability of stock price rise but also a notable chance of decline due to potential negative earnings surprises or macroeconomic influences.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI-related capital expenditure (capex) for Big Tech companies, including Apple. While not directly mentioning Apple's earnings or capex guidance, the article highlights that CEO commentary and commitment to AI development (and specifically, access to Nvidia chips) is very important to investors. The expert's comments indicate that strong commitment and aggressive capex plans related to AI are generally being received positively by the markets. However, there is uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's AI model and its affects on competition, which introduces some potential volatility. Since the main focus is on CEO commentary, and Apple hasn't yet reported, this information is largely neutral until Apple actually releases its earning results. Thus, the effect on Apple is speculative to the news, but still relevant to the overall market sentiment around big tech. Therefore, the short-term price movement is likely to be neutral. However, because the article also mentions Apple's competitors (Microsoft, Meta, IBM) and their AI commitments, strong news on this front would positively impact the whole sector, which would likely include Apple. Overall, I see better chances of a rise than a fall here because the general sentiment will be bullish if Apple is commited to competing in the AI race.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports and capital expenditure (CapEx) plans of major tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and IBM.  While Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the earnings announcements, the article highlights the importance of CEO commentary regarding AI investments and high-end chip spending (like NVIDIA's) for the overall tech sector.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, pending further details on AI model efficiency and corporate commitment to AI development.  Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector and heavily invested in AI, the market's reaction to the other companies' announcements and statements about AI capex could indirectly impact Apple's stock price.  A positive overall sentiment in the tech sector due to strong AI investment plans and confident CEO commentary could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, a negative sentiment might lead to a fall.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the overall cautious optimism, I'm assigning moderate probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the focus on Big Tech earnings and AI capital expenditures (capex), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) among other major tech companies. The commentary highlights the importance of CEO statements and commitment to AI investments, which could influence investor sentiment. Given that Apple is part of the Big Tech group and AI investments are generally viewed positively for long-term growth, this news could have a neutral to slightly positive impact on AAPL's stock price. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's AI strategy or capex plans in the news limits the potential for a significant rise. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that investors are focusing on Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The article highlights the importance of CEO commentary on capital expenditure (capex) for AI development, particularly for high-end Nvidia chips. Apple's stock price movement is not directly addressed in the news, but as a major player in the tech industry, it may be indirectly affected by the overall sentiment and trends discussed. Given that the news does not contain any directly negative information about Apple, and considering the company's strong market position, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the cautious tone from the analyst, Stuart Kaiser, due to lack of clarity on AI models and efficiency, might temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the importance of Big Tech's AI capital expenditure (capex) in the upcoming earnings reports, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article suggests that CEO commentary on capex spend and commitment to high-end AI chips will be crucial. However, the analyst remains cautious due to the lack of clarity on DeepSeek's new AI model. Given the general positive sentiment on large-cap growth and the focus on AI capex, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
