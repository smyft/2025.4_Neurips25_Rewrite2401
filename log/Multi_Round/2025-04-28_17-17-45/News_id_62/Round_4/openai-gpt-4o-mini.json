(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech's AI capex will be just as important as earnings results\nNews Content: Equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are focused in on the Big Tech earnings due out later today and the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision this afternoon. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and IBM (IBM) will release their fourth quarter results after the market close.\n\nStuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi, sits down in-studio on Catalysts to emphasize that the earnings results still matter, but explains the CEO commentary to come in earnings calls will be just as crucial\n\n\"Most of the hyperscalers kind of already recently updated their guidance on CapEx spend. So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that there is a strong focus on earnings results and CEO commentary regarding capital expenditures (CapEx) and AI investments, which could positively influence investor sentiment. Apple, being one of the major tech companies, may see a rise in stock price if the general sentiment around CapEx and AI remains positive. However, uncertainty regarding earnings and the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates introduces a cautious element. Overall, the prevailing optimism about tech spending, combined with the uncertainty, leads to a moderate probability of stock price rise but also a notable chance of decline due to potential negative earnings surprises or macroeconomic influences.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI-related capital expenditure (capex) for Big Tech companies, including Apple. While not directly mentioning Apple's earnings or capex guidance, the article highlights that CEO commentary and commitment to AI development (and specifically, access to Nvidia chips) is very important to investors. The expert's comments indicate that strong commitment and aggressive capex plans related to AI are generally being received positively by the markets. However, there is uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's AI model and its affects on competition, which introduces some potential volatility. Since the main focus is on CEO commentary, and Apple hasn't yet reported, this information is largely neutral until Apple actually releases its earning results. Thus, the effect on Apple is speculative to the news, but still relevant to the overall market sentiment around big tech. Therefore, the short-term price movement is likely to be neutral. However, because the article also mentions Apple's competitors (Microsoft, Meta, IBM) and their AI commitments, strong news on this front would positively impact the whole sector, which would likely include Apple. Overall, I see better chances of a rise than a fall here because the general sentiment will be bullish if Apple is commited to competing in the AI race.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the upcoming earnings reports and capital expenditure (CapEx) plans of major tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and IBM.  While Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the earnings announcements, the article highlights the importance of CEO commentary regarding AI investments and high-end chip spending (like NVIDIA's) for the overall tech sector.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, pending further details on AI model efficiency and corporate commitment to AI development.  Since Apple is a major player in the tech sector and heavily invested in AI, the market's reaction to the other companies' announcements and statements about AI capex could indirectly impact Apple's stock price.  A positive overall sentiment in the tech sector due to strong AI investment plans and confident CEO commentary could lead to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, a negative sentiment might lead to a fall.  Given the indirect nature of the news and the overall cautious optimism, I'm assigning moderate probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the focus on Big Tech earnings and AI capital expenditures (capex), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) among other major tech companies. The commentary highlights the importance of CEO statements and commitment to AI investments, which could influence investor sentiment. Given that Apple is part of the Big Tech group and AI investments are generally viewed positively for long-term growth, this news could have a neutral to slightly positive impact on AAPL's stock price. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's AI strategy or capex plans in the news limits the potential for a significant rise. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that investors are focusing on Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The article highlights the importance of CEO commentary on capital expenditure (capex) for AI development, particularly for high-end Nvidia chips. Apple's stock price movement is not directly addressed in the news, but as a major player in the tech industry, it may be indirectly affected by the overall sentiment and trends discussed. Given that the news does not contain any directly negative information about Apple, and considering the company's strong market position, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the cautious tone from the analyst, Stuart Kaiser, due to lack of clarity on AI models and efficiency, might temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the importance of Big Tech's AI capital expenditure (capex) in the upcoming earnings reports, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article suggests that CEO commentary on capex spend and commitment to high-end AI chips will be crucial. However, the analyst remains cautious due to the lack of clarity on DeepSeek's new AI model. Given the general positive sentiment on large-cap growth and the focus on AI capex, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights the significance of AI-related capital expenditures and CEO commentary for major tech companies, including Apple. While Apple is not the focus of the earnings reports, its position as a leading tech player means it will be influenced by the overall sentiment regarding AI investments and CapEx. The cautious tone from analysts, especially regarding competition and efficiency in AI models, suggests some uncertainty. However, the general optimism around tech spending and potential positive sentiment from competitors' earnings could lead to a slight edge in favor of a stock price increase for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rising than falling, albeit with moderate confidence due to the prevailing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The previous predictions clustered around a slightly higher probability of a rise (around 0.55) than a fall (around 0.45). This was mainly driven by general optimism about tech spending on AI, even though Apple wasn't explicitly mentioned in the news content beyond being part of 'Big Tech'. The news focuses more on CEO commentary regarding AI-related CapEx, so the impact on a specific company prior to its earnings release is somewhat speculative. Given this context, and considering that there's uncertainty regarding the DeepSeek AI model, I will modestly increase the probability of the stock rising, because those previous predictions can be seen as weak signals, and I believe there will be stronger earnings results than expected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's AI investment and upcoming earnings, with emphasis on CEO commentary regarding CapEx and AI development.  Apple, while not explicitly mentioned in earnings announcements, is a major player in this space and will likely be indirectly impacted by the overall market sentiment. The prevailing sentiment is cautiously optimistic, contingent on the specifics of the earnings reports and CEO statements.  The lack of clarity regarding DeepSeek's AI model adds an element of uncertainty.  While a positive market reaction to strong AI-related announcements from other tech giants could boost Apple's stock, a negative or uncertain response could dampen investor enthusiasm. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the existing uncertainty, the probabilities of a rise or fall are relatively close. Previous models' predictions show a range between 0.5 and 0.6 for a price rise and 0.4 to 0.5 for a fall, reflecting a similar level of uncertainty.  I will also account for the inherent market volatility and risk in assigning probabilities, which are slightly tilted towards a price rise given the generally positive perception of increased AI investments in the tech sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article emphasizes the importance of AI capital expenditures (capex) and CEO commentary in the upcoming Big Tech earnings, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is not directly mentioned in the earnings announcements, the focus on AI investments and high-end chips (like NVIDIA's) is relevant to the tech sector as a whole. The sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for positive impact if CEO commentary is favorable. However, uncertainty around DeepSeek's AI model and general market caution due to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision introduces volatility. Given Apple's strong position in the tech sector and the indirect positive sentiment around AI capex, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. Previous predictions also leaned towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, supporting this assessment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline and content emphasize the importance of AI-related capital expenditure (capex) for Big Tech companies, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the news does not directly mention Apple's earnings or capex guidance, the overall sentiment around tech spending on AI is positive. CEO commentary and commitment to AI development, particularly access to high-end Nvidia chips, are viewed as crucial by investors. Given Apple's significant presence in the tech sector and its investments in AI, the general positive sentiment around AI capex could indirectly impact Apple's stock price positively. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's AI strategy or capex plans in the news, along with the cautious tone from analysts due to uncertainties in AI model efficiency, suggests a moderate probability of stock price movement. Considering the overall bullish sentiment in the tech sector and Apple's strong market position, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the importance of Big Tech's AI capital expenditure (capex) in the upcoming earnings reports. The analyst, Stuart Kaiser, highlights the importance of CEO commentary on capex spend and commitment to high-end AI chips. While there is a general positive sentiment on large-cap growth, the lack of clarity on DeepSeek's new AI model introduces some caution. Since the news does not contain any directly negative information about Apple, and considering the company's strong market position, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The probabilities predicted by other models in the previous rounds also indicate a moderate to slightly higher chance of a rise, which supports this estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the market's focus on Big Tech earnings and the emphasis on AI capital expenditure (capex) and CEO commentary on these investments. For Apple, being a major player in technology with significant AI investments, CEO commentary on AI development and capex spend could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. However, there is uncertainty due to factors such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and a lack of specificity regarding Apple's own AI plans. The general market sentiment, while cautiously optimistic, leans towards the positive impact of strong commitments to AI and high-end chip spending.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The recent news emphasizes the significance of AI-related capital expenditures and CEO commentary in determining the market sentiment for major tech companies, including Apple. While Apple is not the focus of the earnings reports, its strong position in the sector means it will likely be affected by the overall sentiment regarding AI investments. The prevailing tone in expert analysis is cautiously optimistic, with a slight bias towards the possibility of positive outcomes from competitors' earnings. Additionally, the uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision adds a level of caution but does not seem to outweigh the overall positive outlook for tech spending in AI. The previous predictions clustered around probabilities indicating that the market sentiment leans slightly more towards a rise than a fall, leading to my estimated probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI-related capital expenditures (capex) for Big Tech companies, including Apple. The expert's comments emphasize that CEO commentary and commitment to AI development are crucial for investors. The previous predictions ranged from 0.55 to 0.6 for the probability of a rise, indicating a general optimism around tech spending on AI. Considering Apple's strong market position and potential indirect positive impact due to overall bullish sentiment in the tech sector, the probability of the stock price rising might be slightly higher. However, the uncertainties mentioned and general market volatility suggest adjusting the probability slightly downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's AI investment and upcoming earnings, emphasizing CEO commentary on CapEx and AI development. Apple, while not directly mentioned in specific earnings reports, is a major player and will be indirectly influenced by the overall market sentiment.  The prevailing sentiment is cautiously optimistic, dependent on the specifics of earnings releases and CEO statements.  Uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's AI model adds complexity. Previous predictions consistently showed a slight bias towards a price rise (around 0.55-0.6) due to the generally positive perception of increased AI investments.  However,  the lack of direct Apple-specific news and the potential impact of the Fed's interest rate decision create considerable uncertainty. Considering the indirect nature of the news, the iterative predictions from various models, and the inherent market volatility, a balanced probability is appropriate, with a slight lean towards a price rise reflecting the long-term positive outlook for AI investment in the tech sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The financial news underscores the market's focus on AI capital expenditures (capex) and CEO commentary in the tech sector, which indirectly impacts Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a major player in the industry. The sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for positive impact if CEO commentary on AI investments is favorable. However, uncertainties such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and the lack of clarity on DeepSeek's AI model introduce volatility.

Apple, while not directly mentioned, is a significant player, and the optimistic sentiment surrounding AI investments could have a positive impact on its stock price. However, uncertainties regarding the Fed's interest rate decision and the specifics of competitors' performance suggest a cautious approach. Considering the previous predictions, the prevailing sentiment leans slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the overall bullish view on tech spending in AI.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of AI-related capital expenditure for Big Tech companies, including Apple. The expert commentary emphasizes that CEO commentary and commitment to AI development are crucial for investors and there is a general optimism around tech spending on AI. Previous predictions were cautiously optimistic, with probabilities leaning toward a rise. The news also mentions the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and DeepSeek's AI model as potential influences, creating volatility. Given Apple's strong market position, AI investments, and the prevailing positive sentiment in the tech sector, the stock price is more likely to rise. However, existing uncertainties suggest a slight moderation in the probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader Big Tech sector's AI investment and upcoming earnings, emphasizing CEO commentary on CapEx and AI development.

The iterative predictions from various models show a convergence toward a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the long-term positive outlook for AI investment in the tech sector, but also acknowledging the inherent market volatility and lack of direct Apple news.  Therefore, I'm slightly adjusting the probability of a rise upward but acknowledging the uncertainty keeps the probabilities relatively close.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news article discusses the importance of Big Tech's AI capital expenditures (capex) and CEO commentary, which indirectly impacts Apple Inc.
