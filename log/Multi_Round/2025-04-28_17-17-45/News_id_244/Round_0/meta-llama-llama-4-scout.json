(AAPL) or provide any company-specific information that could impact its stock price. The news appears to be a general overview of upcoming IPOs and does not contain any direct implications for Apple's business or stock performance. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n\nNote that I've assumed a neutral impact from the news, with equal probabilities of the stock price rising or falling, as there is no specific information provided that could suggest a directional move for Apple's stock price."
