(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly\nNews Content: David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The analysis indicates that Apple Inc. has a manageable level of debt relative to its cash flow and earnings. The company's strong EBIT-to-interest coverage ratio and high conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggest that the debt does not pose a significant risk. Additionally, the overall financial health of Apple, boosted by a large market capitalization, supports a positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of stock price rising is higher than that of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive view of Apple's debt management. It highlights that while Apple does carry debt, it's at a manageable level and is used sparingly and effectively. Key points supporting this include: low net debt to EBITDA ratio, extremely high interest coverage, robust free cash flow generation relative to EBIT, and a decrease from 1 year before. The article concludes that Apple uses debt quite reasonably and that sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. While a small increase in EBIT doesn't scream rapid improvements. This combined with the general view, it is more likely to be positive than negative. However, potential warning signs are also mentioned meaning investors should still be wary. This is not considered likely to trigger a large positive or negative impact alone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's prudent use of debt, highlighting its low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage.  The analysis concludes that Apple's debt levels are manageable and pose minimal risk. This positive assessment of Apple's financial health is unlikely to cause a significant stock price drop. While the positive news might offer a small boost to investor confidence, the impact on Apple's stock price, given its already high valuation and overall market sentiment, is likely to be muted. The '2 warning signs' mentioned are not detailed, and hence their impact is not considered in this analysis.  Therefore, a slight increase in price is more likely than a significant decrease, but the overall impact is predicted to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, emphasizing its strong financial position, low net debt to EBITDA ratio, and high interest coverage. These factors suggest that Apple is managing its debt responsibly, which reduces financial risk and enhances investor confidence. The article also notes Apple's robust free cash flow generation, which further supports its ability to manage debt. Given these positive indicators, the market is likely to view this news favorably, potentially leading to a rise in Apple's stock price. However, the probability of a fall is considered low as there are no immediate red flags or negative implications from the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and EBIT covering its interest expense 673 times over. The company's ability to generate free cash flow amounting to 90% of its EBIT also positions it well to pay down debt if necessary. These factors suggest a positive outlook on Apple's financial health and debt management, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and a high interest cover. The company's ability to generate free cash flow and its strong balance sheet position suggest that it can handle its debt obligations. This positive assessment of Apple's debt management and financial health is likely to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to an increased probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's prudent and conservative approach to leveraging debt. Apple has shown a minimal net debt load, strong cash reserves, and robust EBIT margins, which indicate a company in a strong financial position. These factors suggest that the company can comfortably manage its debt burden, leading to reduced financial risks and improved investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's use of debt presents a mostly positive view. With a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and a high interest coverage ratio, Apple appears to handle its debt conservatively, mitigating any associated risks. The strong generation of free cash flow further supports its financial health, making it capable of managing its liabilities. Despite mentioning 2 warning signs that could raise concerns, the overall financial position remains strong, suggesting that the stock price is more likely to rise, while significant downward movement is not anticipated. Predictions from others also lean heavily towards a bullish outlook, supporting a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds indicates a positive outlook on Apple's debt management, highlighting its conservative approach and strong financial position. The news article itself supports this view, emphasizing the low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation. While the article mentions two unspecified 'warning signs,' the overall tone is optimistic regarding Apple's financial health and ability to manage its debt. Considering prior predictions ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price increase, and interpreting it as generally positive news about Apple's financial stability it is likely to nudge the price up slightly.\n\nGiven the consistency of positive assessments and the inherent limitations in only looking at debt in isolation, I will predict a small increase. The consistent but not extreme degree of positivity also suggests that the stock price effects might be rather mild.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, highlighting its low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage. This positive assessment of Apple's financial health is unlikely to cause a significant stock price drop.  While the news is positive, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, given its already high valuation and the overall market sentiment. The mention of '2 warning signs' (unspecified) introduces uncertainty.  Considering the generally positive sentiment expressed in the article and the previous predictions which largely favor a price increase, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise. However, the lack of detail on the warning signs necessitates some caution, hence I'm not assigning an extremely high probability to price increase. The consensus of previous models also points towards a higher probability of price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's conservative and manageable use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio (0.31) and an exceptionally high interest coverage ratio (673x). The company's strong free cash flow generation (90% of EBIT) and robust balance sheet further underscore its ability to handle debt obligations without significant risk. These positive indicators are likely to bolster investor confidence, suggesting a favorable outlook for the stock price. While the article mentions '2 warning signs,' they are not detailed, limiting their potential negative impact. Overall, the news leans strongly positive, aligning with the majority of previous predictions that favor a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news article highlights Apple's conservative use of debt, with a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and an extremely high interest coverage ratio of 673 times.

These factors suggest that Apple's debt is manageable and does not pose a significant risk.

This positive assessment of Apple's debt management and financial health is likely to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment.
