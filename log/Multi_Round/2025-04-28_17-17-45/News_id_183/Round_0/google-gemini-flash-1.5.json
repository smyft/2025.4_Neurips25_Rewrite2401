It's a general question about the potential for wealth creation in a bull market, not a news item about Apple itself. Therefore, this headline offers no actionable insights into Apple's future stock price. The probability of a price change based on this headline alone is essentially the same as a random fluctuation. We assume a baseline probability of a price rise (or fall) equivalent to historical market trends.   To provide numerical probabilities, we'll make a reasonable assumption about market neutrality in the short term following this non-specific headline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n"
