      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer highlights concerns over slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in the Chinese market, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The elimination of the price estimate and reduction in earnings forecasts suggest a bearish outlook. Historical trends indicate that downgrades often lead to stock price declines. Given these factors, there's a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is a negative signal. Key concerns include slowing iPhone sales globally, particularly a significant drop in sales volume in China due to competition, and the lack of compelling AI features expected to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further reinforce a bearish outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released shortly, the downgrade leading up to the report strongly suggests a likely negative near-term stock price movement. The statistics related to China sales are very specific and concerning. A delayed iPhone replacement cycle into 2026 is also a major concern. Overall, this news is overwhelmingly negative, increasing the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform, coupled with reduced sales and EPS estimates, strongly suggests a negative market reaction.  The cited reasons \u2013 slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI-related features to drive upgrades \u2013 are significant headwinds.  While the earnings release may offer some counter-narrative, the pre-emptive downgrade sets a bearish tone.  The 25% drop in Chinese exports alone is a substantial negative factor.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise, though the possibility of a price rise cannot be completely ruled out due to the potential for positive surprises during earnings release and market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings forecasts. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The mention of sluggish adoption of Apple Intelligence and lack of major generative AI apps further dampens near-term growth prospects. However, the market may already have priced in some of these concerns, and the actual earnings report could provide relief if better than expected. Overall, the negative outlook predominates.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will fall. The downgrade and lowered estimates suggest a pessimistic view on Apple's short-term performance, which typically leads to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. This negative sentiment and reduced estimates suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the actual earnings report is yet to be released, and the market's reaction to the news may be influenced by various factors, including the company's overall performance and future outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and pressures from increased competition in China. The company's export decline in China and reduced forecasted revenues further support a potential negative outlook. With these factors in play, it suggests that investors might lose confidence in the stock, increasing the likelihood of a stock price downturn.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
