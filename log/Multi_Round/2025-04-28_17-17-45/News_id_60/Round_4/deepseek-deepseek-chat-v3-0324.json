      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer highlights concerns over slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in the Chinese market, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The elimination of the price estimate and reduction in earnings forecasts suggest a bearish outlook. Historical trends indicate that downgrades often lead to stock price declines. Given these factors, there's a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is a negative signal. Key concerns include slowing iPhone sales globally, particularly a significant drop in sales volume in China due to competition, and the lack of compelling AI features expected to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further reinforce a bearish outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released shortly, the downgrade leading up to the report strongly suggests a likely negative near-term stock price movement. The statistics related to China sales are very specific and concerning. A delayed iPhone replacement cycle into 2026 is also a major concern. Overall, this news is overwhelmingly negative, increasing the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform, coupled with reduced sales and EPS estimates, strongly suggests a negative market reaction.  The cited reasons \u2013 slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI-related features to drive upgrades \u2013 are significant headwinds.  While the earnings release may offer some counter-narrative, the pre-emptive downgrade sets a bearish tone.  The 25% drop in Chinese exports alone is a substantial negative factor.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise, though the possibility of a price rise cannot be completely ruled out due to the potential for positive surprises during earnings release and market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with reduced sales and earnings forecasts. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The mention of sluggish adoption of Apple Intelligence and lack of major generative AI apps further dampens near-term growth prospects. However, the market may already have priced in some of these concerns, and the actual earnings report could provide relief if better than expected. Overall, the negative outlook predominates.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will fall. The downgrade and lowered estimates suggest a pessimistic view on Apple's short-term performance, which typically leads to a decrease in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, citing a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. This negative sentiment and reduced estimates suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the actual earnings report is yet to be released, and the market's reaction to the news may be influenced by various factors, including the company's overall performance and future outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and pressures from increased competition in China. The company's export decline in China and reduced forecasted revenues further support a potential negative outlook. With these factors in play, it suggests that investors might lose confidence in the stock, increasing the likelihood of a stock price downturn.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' highlights significant concerns regarding slowing iPhone sales and heightened competition in the Chinese market. Analysts have significantly reduced sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, indicating a bearish outlook. In addition, specific statistics showing a 25% drop in exports to China and a potential delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 further reinforce the negative sentiment. Given the overwhelming focus on these negative indicators, it is highly likely that investor confidence will wane, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Although earnings are to be released, the pre-emptive downgrade suggests a market expectation of disappointing performance. Thus, the probability of stock price falling is substantially greater than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from Oppenheimer's downgrade, specifically highlighting slowing iPhone sales and increasing competition in China, is a strong indicator of potential stock price decline. The lowered fiscal 2025 sales and EPS estimates further solidify this bearish outlook. Furthermore, the previous rounds of predictions overwhelmingly favored a stock price fall, suggesting that the consensus is already aligned towards a negative reaction. Given that other models also had high prediction values around 0.7 and 0.8 for a fall, I am factoring in convergence, which usually means that market behavior may be more predictable if consensus is forming.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing slowing iPhone sales, particularly the significant drop in Chinese exports (25% in Q4), and the lack of compelling AI features to drive upgrades, paints a bearish picture.  The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further solidify this negative outlook. While the upcoming earnings report could offer positive surprises, the pre-emptive downgrade and the substantial negative factors already highlighted likely outweigh any potential positive surprises.  The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price drop, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 probability.  Considering the severity of the issues raised and the lack of immediate positive catalysts, I slightly increase the probability of a price fall compared to the average of previous predictions, acknowledging a small chance that the upcoming earnings report might positively surprise the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, along with the elimination of the $250 price estimate and reduced fiscal 2025 sales and EPS forecasts, presents a bearish outlook. Historical trends suggest that such downgrades often lead to stock price declines. The specific concerns about declining sales in China (25% drop in exports) and sluggish adoption of Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps further dampen near-term growth prospects. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the preemptive downgrade and reduced estimates strongly suggest a negative short-term impact on the stock price. Considering the unanimous bearish sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will fall. The downgrade and lowered estimates suggest a pessimistic view on Apple's short-term performance, which typically leads to a decrease in stock price. However, the market may have already priced in some of these concerns, and the actual earnings report could provide relief if better than expected. Considering the consensus of multiple models, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, leading to reduced sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025. This downgrade, combined with a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps, suggests a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance. The majority of previous predictions also indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with concerns over the delayed iPhone replacement cycle and the significant drop in Chinese exports. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and increased competition in China. The reduction in sales and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2025, along with a 25% drop in exports to China, paints a negative picture for the short-term performance. Previous predictions from several models consistently indicate a higher probability of stock price falling due to these factors. Although there is a chance that the actual earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the current negative sentiment is strong.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China presents a strong bearish outlook. The analysts' reduction of sales and earnings per share estimates adds to this negative sentiment, as does the significant drop in exports to China. Given the overwhelming consensus among previous predictions indicating a higher likelihood of stock price decline, combined with the absence of positive catalysts in the immediate term, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is notably higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The overarching sentiment regarding Apple (AAPL) remains bearish after Oppenheimer's downgrade, citing concerns over slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling catalysts like AI applications to drive upgrades. The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 reinforce the negative outlook. While the upcoming earnings report introduces some uncertainty, the preemptive downgrade and significant issues cited (e.g., -25% China exports) outweigh potential positive surprises. Previous model predictions consistently favor a price decrease, and accounting for this convergence and the severity of the downgrade, a downward movement remains highly probable. There is a slight adjustment to a small increase in the probability of rising, in comparison with other's predictions in the previous round, recognizing a small chance that the upcoming earnings report might positively surprise the market.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing slowing iPhone sales (especially a significant 25% drop in Chinese exports), lack of compelling AI features, and reduced sales/EPS forecasts for FY2025, paints a strongly bearish picture.  The consensus among multiple AI models in previous rounds consistently predicts a higher probability of a stock price fall (averaging around 0.75-0.8). While the upcoming earnings report could offer some positive surprise, the pre-emptive downgrade and substantial negative factors significantly outweigh any potential positive news. The consistent negative sentiment across multiple analyses strengthens the likelihood of a price decline.  I am therefore adjusting the probability slightly higher than the average of the previous round to account for the weight of the negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer, citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, pointing to a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps. The 25% drop in exports to China is particularly concerning. These factors collectively suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the near term. While the upcoming earnings report could potentially offer some positive surprises, the pre-emptive downgrade and the negative sentiment from previous predictions indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Considering the consensus of multiple models and the negative indicators such as a 25% drop in Chinese exports, a delayed iPhone replacement cycle, and reduced forecasts, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than rising. However, the actual earnings report could provide some positive surprises, which might slightly mitigate the negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Oppenheimer downgrading Apple Inc. from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China, particularly the significant drop in exports to China, presents a bearish outlook. The elimination of the $250 price estimate and reduced fiscal 2025 sales and EPS forecasts further reinforce this negative sentiment. Historical trends and previous predictions from multiple models consistently indicate that such downgrades often lead to stock price declines. Although there is a chance that the actual earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the current negative sentiment and unanimous bearish predictions from previous rounds suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to slower iPhone sales and increased competition in China. The reduction in sales and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2025, along with a 25% drop in exports to China, paints a negative picture for the short-term performance. Previous predictions from several models consistently indicate a higher probability of stock price falling due to these factors. Although there is a chance that the actual earnings report could provide some positive surprises, the current negative sentiment is strong.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' is primarily driven by concerns over slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in the Chinese market, evidenced by a significant drop in exports. Coupled with lowered fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates, this paints a notably bearish outlook. The consensus among previous predictions indicates a strong likelihood of a stock price decline. While there is a possibility of a positive earnings surprise, the overall sentiment remains negative, suggesting a greater probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.18, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.82, Reasoning: The continued downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slowing iPhone sales particularly in China, and the lack of compelling AI features to drive upgrades paints a bearish picture. Reduced sales and EPS forecasts for fiscal 2025 further solidify this negative outlook. Previous AI models consistently predict a higher probability of the stock falling. Given that the earnings report is scheduled soon, there's a chance for a positive surprise, but the overwhelming negative sentiment makes it LESS LIKELY. Furthermore, the drop in China exports is significant. All metrics from all previous rounds indicate that the market believes the stock price will fall. The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price drop. Thus, the probability of stock price fall is substantially greater than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The overwhelming consensus among multiple AI models, across three rounds of predictions, points towards a high probability of Apple's stock price falling following Oppenheimer's downgrade.  The downgrade, based on slowing iPhone sales, particularly the significant 25% drop in Chinese exports, and the lack of compelling AI-driven upgrades, presents a strongly bearish outlook.  Reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further solidify this negative sentiment. While the upcoming earnings report could offer a positive surprise, the pre-emptive downgrade and the severity of the cited issues significantly outweigh any potential positive impact.  The consistent negative sentiment across multiple analyses, and the convergence of predictions toward a stock price decline across different models, strengthens the likelihood of a price decrease.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a stock price fall, acknowledging a small possibility of a positive surprise in the earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant downgrade of Apple by Oppenheimer, citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.
