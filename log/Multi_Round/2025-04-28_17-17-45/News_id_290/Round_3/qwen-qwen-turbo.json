(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly in the context of innovation and market conditions. He defends Apple against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which may positively influence investor sentiment. However, concerns around the broader market dynamics, such as inflation and interest rates, could also lead to cautious trading of Apple stock. Despite these factors, Cramer's affirmation of Apple's strong brand and technology ecosystem suggests a generally positive outlook for the company's stock, but concerns about AI and product sales momentum may temper expectations. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise, but also a significant probability of a price fall given market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the company's future growth. The article also mentions Apple's stock performance after the WWDC conference, indicating a positive reaction to their product announcements. However, the article also points out concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date, as well as questions about the company's ability to push AI to consumers through its products. The mention of other AI stocks presenting more promising opportunities could also detract from Apple's appeal. Overall, the news is neutral, but with the added layer of Apple being mentioned alongside \"more promising\" AI stocks, I lean towards a slightly lower probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall. It's important to remember this is based solely on this one article and a comprehensive analysis would consider various market factors, Apple's financial reports, and broader analyst sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Jim Cramer's comments regarding Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer dismisses Zuckerberg's assertion of a lack of innovation at Apple since Steve Jobs, this is not a strong bullish catalyst.  The article also highlights Cramer's focus on AI stocks, suggesting that he sees potentially higher returns in that space compared to Apple. The overall tone is neutral to slightly bearish concerning Apple's future growth compared to other sectors. The mention of Apple is within a broader discussion of market trends and other companies.  Therefore, the impact of this specific news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The probability of a price movement in either direction due solely to this news is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Cramer defends Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs, the article does not provide specific financial or operational updates about Apple that would significantly impact its stock price. The broader market context (e.g., PPI data, bond market reactions) is mentioned but is not directly tied to Apple's performance. The mixed performance of Apple's stock in 2025 and investor concerns about AI integration and iPhone sales momentum are noted, but no concrete negative or positive catalysts are highlighted. Given the lack of material news specific to Apple, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly influenced by broader market trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Cramer defends Apple against comments that the company has not innovated since Steve Jobs' death, calling such statements 'inflammatory'. However, the overall tone of the article does not indicate a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The article also mentions that Apple's shares are down 4.3% year-to-date, but this is not directly related to Cramer's comments. Given the neutral tone and lack of significant news, I estimate a low probability of a major stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with an analyst criticizing the perceived lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs. However, the overall market context and the company's strong position in the technology sector suggest a balanced outlook. The stock has seen positive performance trends leading up to recent events, which may offset the negative comments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's defense of Apple Inc. against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the overall context reveals mixed sentiments regarding Apple's stock performance and broader market dynamics, including concerns about inflation and interest rates. While Cramer's comments may provide some support for the stock, questions about Apple's ability to drive innovation and competition from 'more promising' AI stocks may temper expectations. Considering these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise, but also a significant probability of a price fall due to ongoing market concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily centers around Jim Cramer's commentary on various market aspects, with Apple mentioned specifically in the context of innovation debates. While Cramer defends Apple against accusations of stagnation post-Steve Jobs, the article also highlights concerns about AI integration and sales momentum. The previous round's predictions are quite varied, with some leaning towards a slightly negative outlook, possibly influenced by the AI focus shifting investor attention away from Apple. Given that Cramer's defense could be seen as a positive signal, but questions remain about future growth relative to AI stocks, the situation is nuanced. Furthermore, the fact that almost all previous predictions are no more than 0.55 indicating rising probability suggests that it's hard to be confidently positive about AAPL, given the ambiguous information. I'll adjust slightly upwards the rising probability compared to some previous models. Overall, I think it's a slightly more bullish scenario compared to earlier predictions, although the AI concern still weighs.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news piece is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock. While Jim Cramer defends Apple against criticism of its post-Steve Jobs innovation, this is not a strong bullish signal.  The article highlights ongoing concerns about Apple's AI strategy and iPhone sales momentum, tempering any positive sentiment. The mention of other, potentially more promising AI companies further suggests that this news is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price on its own. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning slightly toward a higher chance of price fall than rise, given the lack of positive company-specific news and the overall market uncertainty highlighted in the article.  My prediction incorporates these previous predictions and leans slightly toward a higher probability of a price fall due to the market uncertainties, while recognizing the potential of Cramer's defense to mitigate some negative impact. This is therefore a cautiously neutral prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer defending the company against claims of no innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive signal. However, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's stock performance year-to-date and its ability to push AI to consumers, which may temper investor enthusiasm. The broader market context, including inflation and interest rates, is mentioned but not directly tied to Apple's performance. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of Cramer's comments and the lack of significant negative catalysts, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly positive. Previous predictions also indicate a balanced outlook, with most models estimating a moderate probability of a price rise or fall. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly his defense against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While this may positively influence investor sentiment, concerns around broader market dynamics, such as inflation and interest rates, could lead to cautious trading. Additionally, questions about Apple's AI integration and iPhone sales momentum may temper expectations. Considering the mixed performance of Apple's stock in 2025 and the neutral to slightly bearish tone of the article, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise and a relatively lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with Jim Cramer defending the company against claims of lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. However, the article also mentions concerns about Apple's ability to push AI to consumers and the stock's year-to-date performance. Considering the neutral tone and lack of significant news, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the cautious market conditions and concerns about Apple's innovation and product sales momentum. The predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most lean towards a neutral to slightly bearish outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc., as highlighted by Jim Cramer's defense against allegations of lack of innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer's comments aim to counterbalance potential investor concerns, but the news also notes that Apple's stock is down year-to-date and that there are ongoing discussions about innovation and the impact of broader market conditions such as inflation and interest rates. Despite the defensive stance on Apple's innovation, the lack of specific positive news and the context of weaker-than-expected stock performance introduce uncertainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news from Jim Cramer reflects a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's innovation and market performance. While Cramer's defense of Apple against claims of stagnation may positively influence investor sentiment, ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and competition from more promising AI stocks temper the overall enthusiasm. Predictions from various models show a tendency towards a roughly balanced view, with some leaning slightly towards a price fall. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise and a slightly higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed sentiment regarding Apple. Jim Cramer defends Apple against claims of lacking innovation, which could be seen as slightly positive. However, the article also points out concerns with Apple's YTD performance and questions about AI integration, as well as mentions \"more promising\" AI stocks, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Considering the trend of previous rounds' predictions, which are mostly leaning towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook toward AAPL, and no significant positive news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. The fact that many AI stocks are outperforming AAPL is a significant concern mentioned in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news piece is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock.  Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against innovation criticisms is a mild positive, but it's not a significant bullish catalyst.  The article highlights ongoing concerns about Apple's AI strategy and iPhone sales momentum, which counter any potential positive impact from Cramer's comments.  The mention of more promising AI stocks further suggests that this news alone is unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, mostly slightly bearish, reflecting the mixed signals in the news and concerns about broader market factors. Considering the lack of strong positive news specific to Apple and the ongoing market uncertainty, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise. However, given the overall neutrality and the inherent volatility of the stock market, neither rise nor fall is highly likely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer defending the company against claims of no innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive signal.

Considering the mixed performance of Apple's stock in 2025 and the neutral to slightly bearish tone of the article, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise and a relatively lower probability of a price fall. The previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, but most lean towards a neutral to slightly bearish outlook, with rising probabilities generally not exceeding 0.55. Given this context, I adjust my predictions to reflect a slightly cautious stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly his defense against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs.
