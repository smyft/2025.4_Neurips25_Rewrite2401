(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically mentioning that he sold some of his stock due to its large portfolio weight and his expectation of disappointing quarterly results. His commentary typically influences market sentiment, and a warning from a well-known figure like Cramer may lead investors to anticipate a decline. Additionally, his comments suggest possible downgrades by analysts, which could further pressure the stock downward. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust sold some Apple stock because it became too large a part of their portfolio. This action, coupled with Cramer's statement predicting a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades, signals a short-term negative outlook. While the article acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment suggests downward pressure. Cramer's comments will likely influence other investors. Also other AI contenders are being touted above AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but controversial financial commentator, stated that he sold some Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio and predicted a lower stock price due to an anticipated disappointing quarter and potential analyst downgrades.  While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential,  his short-term outlook is negative.  His opinion, while influential to some investors, is not a definitive predictor of market movement.  Other market factors and Apple's actual earnings report will have a much stronger impact.  The overall sentiment expressed leans slightly bearish, but the probability isn't overwhelmingly high due to the inherent uncertainty in the market and the limited scope of the news (one investor selling due to portfolio management, not a change in fundamentals).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio weight and predicts a potential earnings miss. Cramer also anticipates downgrades from analysts ahead of the earnings report, which could pressure the stock in the short term. While he acknowledges AAPL's long-term growth potential, the immediate sentiment appears bearish due to concerns over quarterly performance and potential downgrades. Given this mixed outlook, the short-term impact leans slightly negative, but the long-term view remains neutral to positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple's (AAPL) upcoming quarterly results, stating that he believes the company will miss expectations. He also mentioned that he sold some of his Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expects the stock to go lower. Additionally, he suggested that there might be downgrades from analysts ahead of the quarterly report, which could further pressure the stock price. Given Cramer's influence and the specific nature of his comments, there is a higher likelihood of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL) on CNBC's Squawk on the Street. Cramer stated that he sold some AAPL stock because it had become too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarterly results, which may lead to a decline in the stock price. However, he also mentioned that AAPL has been a strong performer over the long term and that downgrades often lead to buying opportunities. Given this mixed outlook, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling due to this news to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) and specifically mentions that he sold some of his stock due to its substantial weight in his portfolio. Cramer also anticipates disappointing quarterly results and potential analyst downgrades, which historically exert downward pressure on stock prices. Despite acknowledging AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment appears bearish given Cramer's influential role in market sentiment and the overall context of the news. Most previous predictions indicate a stronger probability of falling stock prices based on similar reasoning. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The overwhelming sentiment from the news and previous predictions is negative. Jim Cramer's decision to sell a portion of his Apple stock, coupled with his anticipation of a disappointing quarter and potential analyst downgrades, points towards a likely decrease in the stock price. While the article acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate short-term sentiment is bearish. Previous predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, thus solidifying the negative outlook. The fact that Cramer is reducing his position because it's *too* big also implies a strategic shift away from aggressive AAPL ownership, which could influence other large investors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling Apple stock due to portfolio size and anticipating a disappointing quarter carries significant weight, given his influence.  While he acknowledges long-term potential, his negative short-term outlook is the dominant factor in this news.  The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, it's crucial to remember that Cramer's opinions are not foolproof predictors and the market's reaction could be nuanced.  The probability of a price fall is likely higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the many factors influencing Apple's stock beyond Cramer's comments.  I've adjusted the probabilities slightly upward for the probability of a price rise to reflect the potential for some investors to view Cramer's comments as an opportunity to buy at a lower price, and the potential for other positive news or market factors to offset his concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to its large portfolio weight and his prediction of disappointing quarterly results. Cramer's influence and his expectation of potential analyst downgrades suggest a negative short-term sentiment. While he acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate outlook appears bearish. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Jim Cramer sold some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's upcoming quarterly results, predicting a potential earnings miss and possible analyst downgrades. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, his short-term outlook is negative. The consensus among various models suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising due to this news. Considering the influence of Cramer's comments and the specific nature of his concerns, there seems to be a bearish sentiment in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses concerns about the company's upcoming quarterly results and mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio weight. He also anticipates potential downgrades from analysts, which could pressure the stock in the short term. Given the negative sentiment from Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, and considering the mixed but overall bearish outlook from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising. However, it's essential to note that Cramer's opinions, while influential, are not definitive predictors of market movement, and actual earnings reports along with broader market factors will have a more significant impact on the stock price. The trend from previous predictions also indicates a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing his decision to sell some of the stock and predicting a potential drop in the stock price due to an expected earnings miss and potential downgrades from analysts. While some predict a slight optimism based on the stock's long-term performance, Cramer's recent comments and actions cast a shadow of negativity on the near-term outlook. Multiple predictions from different models suggest a bearish sentiment aligned with Cramer's outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's decision to sell some of his Apple stock due to its substantial weight in his portfolio, along with his prediction of disappointing quarterly results and potential analyst downgrades, suggests a bearish short-term sentiment towards AAPL. Cramer is a well-known figure in the financial community, and his warnings typically influence investor behavior negatively. Despite acknowledging Apple's long-term potential, the immediate outlook from multiple models leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, supported by the consensus built from previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The consistency in negative sentiment surrounding Apple (AAPL) driven by Jim Cramer's actions and predictions is compelling. He has sold stock, anticipates negative earnings, and expects downgrades. The previous rounds of predictions consistently favor a stock price decline, and there is no new information to suggest a shift in this bearish outlook. While long-term potential might exist, the short-term signals are overwhelmingly negative. Therefore, my prediction is influenced by Cramer's immediate actions and the collective bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news centers around Jim Cramer's decision to reduce his Apple holdings due to portfolio rebalancing and his prediction of a disappointing Apple earnings report, potentially leading to analyst downgrades.  While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, his short-term outlook is decidedly negative.  The consensus among previous AI models strongly suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline.  This negative sentiment, combined with the weight Cramer's opinions carry in the market, points towards a bearish outlook in the short term.  However, the probability isn't 100% due to the unpredictable nature of the market and the possibility of other positive factors influencing the stock price. The fact that this is portfolio management, not a fundamental shift in Apple's outlook, tempers the bearish sentiment somewhat.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to its large portfolio weight and his negative outlook on the company's upcoming quarterly results, including potential analyst downgrades. Cramer's influential role in market sentiment suggests a bearish short-term impact. However, he also acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, which slightly tempers the negative sentiment. Given the consensus from previous predictions and the specific concerns raised by Cramer, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising in the immediate term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Jim Cramer sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's upcoming quarterly results, predicting a potential earnings miss and possible analyst downgrades. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, his short-term outlook is negative. The consensus among various models suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising due to this news. Considering the influence of Cramer's comments and the specific nature of his concerns, there seems to be a bearish sentiment in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically his decision to sell some of the stock due to its large portfolio weight and his prediction of disappointing quarterly results. Cramer's influence and his expectation of potential analyst downgrades suggest a negative short-term sentiment. While he acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate outlook appears bearish. Considering the trend from previous predictions and the overall bearish sentiment expressed by various models, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's decision to sell Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to its substantial weight in his portfolio and his prediction of a disappointed quarterly result. Cramer's statements imply both potential downgrades from analysts and a reduction in investment. Several previous predictions from different models show a consistent bearish sentiment, supporting the view that Cramer's opinion and potential analyst actions contribute significantly to negative expectations. Though Cramer acknowledged AAPL's long-term potential, the overwhelming focus on the short-term negative outlook, combined with historical trends in similar scenarios, suggests that these factors carry more weight.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly his decision to sell some of his stock due to it being too large a part of his portfolio. He predicts disappointing quarterly results and anticipates potential analyst downgrades, which typically exert downward pressure on stocks. The overall sentiment from multiple predictive models leans heavily towards a bearish outlook in the short term. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate negative sentiment driven by his actions and comments results in a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.27, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.73, Reasoning: The continuous negative sentiment surrounding Apple (AAPL), fueled by Jim Cramer's actions (selling shares) and predictions (disappointing earnings, potential downgrades), overwhelmingly points to a bearish outlook. Past predictions consistently favor a stock price decline, and Cramer's influence amplifies these concerns. Although Apple has long-term potential, the current indicators strongly suggest a short-term decline is more probable. I am also noting a potential saturation point in others' estimates, with a slight increase in disagreement in their opinions, such that my price movement estimates will remain closer to the round three estimations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's actions and predictions regarding Apple (AAPL).  He sold some of his stock due to portfolio rebalancing and anticipates a disappointing quarterly report, leading to potential analyst downgrades.  While acknowledging AAPL's long-term potential, his short-term outlook is strongly negative.  This negative assessment, combined with his influence on market sentiment, creates a bearish bias.  The consistent predictions across various models in previous rounds further reinforce this negative outlook.  Although some might see Cramer's sell-off as an opportunity to buy low, the immediate impact is likely negative due to the weight of his opinion and the expectation of disappointing earnings. The previous predictions consistently showing a higher probability of a price fall support this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to its large portfolio weight and his prediction of disappointing quarterly results, including potential analyst downgrades. Cramer's influential role in market sentiment suggests a bearish short-term impact. While he acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate outlook appears negative. The consensus from previous predictions consistently leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, supported by the specific concerns raised by Cramer. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be significantly higher than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline states that Jim Cramer sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and predicts a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades, which could pressure the stock price downward. Multiple AI models have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, with estimates ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 for the probability of a fall. Given Cramer's influential role in market sentiment and the specific nature of his concerns, there seems to be a bearish sentiment in the short term. However, the long-term potential of AAPL is acknowledged, which slightly tempers the negative outlook. Considering the trend from previous predictions and the overall bearish sentiment expressed by various models, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc.
