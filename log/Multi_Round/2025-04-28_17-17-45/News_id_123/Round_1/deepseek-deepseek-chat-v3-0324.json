(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically mentioning that he sold some of his stock due to its large portfolio weight and his expectation of disappointing quarterly results. His commentary typically influences market sentiment, and a warning from a well-known figure like Cramer may lead investors to anticipate a decline. Additionally, his comments suggest possible downgrades by analysts, which could further pressure the stock downward. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust sold some Apple stock because it became too large a part of their portfolio. This action, coupled with Cramer's statement predicting a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades, signals a short-term negative outlook. While the article acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment suggests downward pressure. Cramer's comments will likely influence other investors. Also other AI contenders are being touted above AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but controversial financial commentator, stated that he sold some Apple stock because of its oversized position in his portfolio and predicted a lower stock price due to an anticipated disappointing quarter and potential analyst downgrades.  While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential,  his short-term outlook is negative.  His opinion, while influential to some investors, is not a definitive predictor of market movement.  Other market factors and Apple's actual earnings report will have a much stronger impact.  The overall sentiment expressed leans slightly bearish, but the probability isn't overwhelmingly high due to the inherent uncertainty in the market and the limited scope of the news (one investor selling due to portfolio management, not a change in fundamentals).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio weight and predicts a potential earnings miss. Cramer also anticipates downgrades from analysts ahead of the earnings report, which could pressure the stock in the short term. While he acknowledges AAPL's long-term growth potential, the immediate sentiment appears bearish due to concerns over quarterly performance and potential downgrades. Given this mixed outlook, the short-term impact leans slightly negative, but the long-term view remains neutral to positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple's (AAPL) upcoming quarterly results, stating that he believes the company will miss expectations. He also mentioned that he sold some of his Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expects the stock to go lower. Additionally, he suggested that there might be downgrades from analysts ahead of the quarterly report, which could further pressure the stock price. Given Cramer's influence and the specific nature of his comments, there is a higher likelihood of a negative short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis is based on Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL) on CNBC's Squawk on the Street. Cramer stated that he sold some AAPL stock because it had become too big a part of his portfolio and believes the company will post disappointing quarterly results, which may lead to a decline in the stock price. However, he also mentioned that AAPL has been a strong performer over the long term and that downgrades often lead to buying opportunities. Given this mixed outlook, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling due to this news to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
