(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look\nNews Content: This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) has faced downward pressure recently, losing approximately 15% of its value due to concerns about its AI strategy and challenges in China. Analysts have been bearish, with some projecting a guidance cut. Conversely, there is a contingent of investors who believe that the negative sentiment is overstated and expect an announcement of a local AI partnership soon. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price fall, as recent trend analysis shows a general lack of upward momentum compared to both its peers and the broader market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While overall market earnings are strong, Apple has underperformed recently, dropping 15% from its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Analyst sentiment is somewhat bearish, with some projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised down. However, Apple bulls believe the China issue is manageable and anticipate an AI partnership announcement soon, with Baidu, Tencent, and ByteDance mentioned as potential partners. The article notes Apple's net margins are expected to be modestly up. Given the negative recent performance and analyst concerns, but also the potential catalysts from AI and stable margins, I believe a slight downward bias is present. The Q4 earnings report release acts as a major event, and the market expectation seems tilted towards a negative surprise. I am setting slightly higher probability for a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings. While the overall earnings season is showing positive results, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China operations and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and estimates for future fiscal years have been revised downward. However, bullish sentiment suggests this negativity might be overdone, pointing to potential partnerships with Chinese AI companies as a mitigating factor.  The article highlights that Apple's net margins are expected to modestly increase, which could be a positive factor. Considering the mixed signals, a neutral probability is assigned, slightly leaning towards a price fall given the bearish predictions and recent underperformance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q4 earnings report. Key points include: 1) Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since Christmas due to concerns about China and AI strategy. 2) Bearish analysts project a guidance cut, and fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates have been declining. 3) Bulls argue the negative sentiment is overdone, expecting Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. 4) Net margins are expected to be modestly up year-over-year. Given the mixed sentiment, with bearish concerns weighing on the stock but potential for positive surprises (e.g., AI partnership), the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed toward downside risk due to pre-earnings pessimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's stock has been struggling lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The stock has lost about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas. Some bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone, acknowledging that China headwinds are manageable and expecting Apple to announce a local AI partner soon. Given these mixed sentiments, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the overall earnings season. The article mentions that Apple's stock has struggled lately, losing around 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner soon. The article also provides a broader context of the earnings season, with many companies reporting strong results. Given the mixed sentiment and the potential for a positive surprise from Apple's earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's recent performance has shown a downward trend, with a decline of about 15% since hitting its 52-week high around Christmas. Analysts are concerned about potential guidance cuts and the impact of ongoing issues related to China. However, there are optimistic views suggesting manageable challenges and potential partnerships which might offset negative perceptions. The contrast with positively trending companies like Tesla suggests a shift in market sentiment, which may negatively affect investor confidence in Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Given the recent performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL), which has dropped about 15% since its 52-week high, there are significant bearish sentiments surrounding the upcoming Q4 earnings report. Concerns about its AI strategy and the implications of challenges in China contribute to a negative outlook. Some analysts predict a guidance cut, and the downgrading of EPS estimates for the current and following fiscal years adds to the negative sentiment. Although there is a faction of investors who believe the negativity is overstated, with potential AI partnerships on the horizon, the overall outlook appears cautious. This mix of bearish sentiment and potential positive developments leads to a heavier weight on the probabilities favoring a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple is mixed, but leaning slightly negative. The stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about China and its AI strategy, losing 15% of its value from its 52-week high. There is a possibility of a guidance cut predicted by bearish analysts and downward revisions in future estimates. However, some believe the negative sentiment is overdone, with the potential for an AI partnership with a Chinese firm to boost the stock. Although Apple's net margins are expected to modestly increase, on weighing all factors, I believe the stock is more likely to fall than rise. The trend of other models' predictions from earlier rounds indicates a more bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings.  While the broader market and many companies are showing strong Q4 results, Apple has underperformed recently (-15% since its 52-week high) due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Analyst sentiment is divided: some predict a guidance cut while others believe the negativity is overdone, pointing to potential AI partnerships in China as a mitigating factor.  Apple's expected modestly higher net margins are a positive, but the negative recent performance and bearish predictions create a downward bias.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, generally leaning slightly towards a price fall. Considering the mixed signals, I assign a probability slightly favoring a price fall, reflecting the pre-earnings negativity and the overall uncertainty. However, the potential for a positive surprise from an AI partnership announcement or better-than-expected earnings could significantly influence the post-earnings stock movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q4 earnings report. On the negative side, the stock has underperformed recently, losing 15% of its value due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates have been revised downward. On the positive side, Apple bulls argue the negative sentiment is overdone, expecting the company to announce a local AI partner soon, which could alleviate some concerns. Additionally, net margins are expected to modestly improve year-over-year. Given the pre-earnings pessimism and recent downward trend, the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a stock price fall, but the potential for positive surprises from the earnings report or AI partnership announcements provides some upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q4 earnings report. The stock has recently underperformed, losing about 15% of its value due to concerns about China and its AI strategy.

However, bulls argue that the negative sentiment is overdone, citing manageable China headwinds and the potential for an AI partnership announcement soon. Given these mixed signals, with bearish concerns weighing on the stock but potential for positive surprises, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed toward downside risk due to pre-earnings pessimism. However, the overall earnings season trend is positive, with many companies reporting strong results, which could mitigate the downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q4 earnings, with the company's stock struggling lately due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Despite this, some analysts believe the issue is manageable and that Apple may announce a local AI partner soon. Considering the overall strong earnings season and the potential for a positive surprise from Apple's earnings report, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. However, the bearish predictions and recent underperformance of the stock suggest a cautious approach, leading to a relatively balanced probability assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's recent performance has shown a downward trend, with a decline of about 15% since hitting its 52-week high around Christmas.

The contrast with positively trending companies like Tesla suggests a shift in market sentiment, which may negatively affect investor confidence in Apple. Additionally, previous predictions mostly lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, indicating a general bearish sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The recent financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) leading into its Q4 earnings report. Despite the overall positive sentiment in the broader market and many companies outperforming, Apple has struggled due to concerns over its AI strategy and challenges with China, contributing to a 15% decline from its 52-week high. Analysts are split, with bearish views projecting a guidance cut and reduced forecasts for future earnings, while some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overstated and anticipate a positive announcement regarding a local AI partnership. Given this context, the probabilities reflect a slight bias toward a price decline due to recent underperformance and bearish sentiment, although there is still a possibility for an upward movement, particularly if the earnings report exceeds expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The overall sentiment toward Apple is still mixed, with bearish pressures from China and AI strategy concerns, offset by potential AI partnerships and slightly improving net margins. The stock's recent underperformance and analyst projections of a guidance cut contribute to a negative outlook. However, the persistent belief among some that negativity is overdone and the potential for a local AI partnership provides some upside. Considering the mixed signals and the slightly negative shift in probabilities presented by other models in previous rounds, I'm maintaining a slightly bearish stance but adjusting slightly due to bullish counterarguments. My probabilities reflect the existing downward pressure but also acknowledge the increasing likelihood of a positive surprise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the overall market shows strong earnings, Apple has underperformed recently, losing 15% due to China concerns and its AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and future year estimates are down. However, bullish investors see this negativity as overdone, anticipating a Chinese AI partnership.  Apple's net margins are expected to modestly increase.  Previous predictions are largely bearish, with probabilities of a price fall consistently above 0.5. The weight of evidence leans towards a price fall, but the potential for a positive surprise from the earnings report or an AI partnership announcement introduces some uncertainty. The overall market strength provides some mitigating factor to the downside risk.  Considering the mixed signals and the bearish consensus from previous models, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, while acknowledging the possibility of a positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
