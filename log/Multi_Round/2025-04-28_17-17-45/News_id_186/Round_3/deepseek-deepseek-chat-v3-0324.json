(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, with a 13.77% decline. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing modest growth; however, the lack of changes in analyst estimates suggests stagnation in investor momentum. A Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) implies uncertainty. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a rise is moderate, while the likelihood of a fall is also present due to previous underperformance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the recent trading session showed a slight gain (+0.53%), it lagged behind the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The past month's performance also trails both the Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500. The upcoming earnings report is a key event to watch. Projected EPS and revenue show YoY growth, which is a positive sign. However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. The high forward P/E ratio and PEG ratio indicate that the stock might be overvalued compared to its peers. Considering these factors, there isn't a clear bullish or bearish signal. The stagnation in EPS projection may provide further downward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the company's earnings projections are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue,  the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is a concern.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) indicates neutral sentiment from analysts.  The high Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry peers. Although the industry ranking is positive, this is not directly indicative of Apple's performance given that it's trading at a premium. The neutral Zacks Rank and valuation metrics temper the optimism from the positive earnings projections. Considering these factors, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, although neither is strongly indicated by the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) showed a modest gain of 0.53% in the latest trading session, but it underperformed compared to broader market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Over the past month, AAPL has declined by 13.77%, significantly underperforming its sector and the S&P 500. The upcoming earnings report on January 30, 2025, is a critical event, with projected EPS growth of 8.26% and revenue growth of 3.78% year-over-year. The Zacks Rank for AAPL is currently #3 (Hold), indicating neutral sentiment, and the Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is trading at a premium compared to industry averages. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive earnings projections but high valuation metrics and recent underperformance\u2014the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by these factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price rose but lagged behind the market. The company's recent performance has been mixed, with a 0.53% increase in the latest trading session but a 13.77% loss over the previous month. The upcoming earnings report on January 30, 2025, is expected to show an 8.26% increase in EPS and a 3.78% rise in revenue. The stock has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) and a premium Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. Considering these factors, the news is neutral to slightly positive, but the stock's performance is likely to be influenced more by the earnings report and overall market conditions. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On one hand, the company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to increase by 8.26% from the same quarter last year, and the full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion, representing year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively. On the other hand, the stock has witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector, and the current valuation metrics, including a Forward P/E ratio of 29.97, signify a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry. Additionally, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling due to the positive earnings projections and industry trends, but the stock's recent underperformance and high valuation metrics are causes for concern.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company's earnings expectations for Q1 2025 show positive growth projections with expected EPS of $2.36 (+8.26%) and revenue of $124.1B (+3.78%). However, the recent monthly decline of 13.77% and trailing behind broad market gains suggest investor concern. Furthermore, the company\u2019s valuation metrics like high Forward P/E (29.97) and PEG ratio (2.18) point towards overvaluation. Given the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), there's no strong momentum but there's also no significant negative pressure unless actual earnings miss estimates.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has shown a slight daily gain of 0.53% but has underperformed compared to broader market indices over the past month. The company's anticipated earnings report on January 30, 2025, is significant, with projected year-over-year growth in EPS (8.26%) and revenue (3.78%). However, the stock's recent decline of 13.77% and current high Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest potential overvaluation. Additionally, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) reflects a neutral sentiment among analysts. Overall, while there are positive signals regarding earnings projections, the mixed performance and premium valuation metrics introduce caution. Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate a slightly higher probability of falling stock prices than rising ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the daily gain is positive, it lags the broader market. The past month's performance shows a significant decline compared to its sector and the S&P 500. Upcoming earnings projections are positive, but the Zacks Rank is neutral (Hold). The stock is trading at a valuation premium compared to peers. Considering the previous predictions, where the models leaned towards a slight negative sentiment, I will slightly adjust my probabilities to reflect this trend. The high valuation combined with neutral outlook will likely cause the stock to fall slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings show positive growth, the recent underperformance against market indices and a 13.77% monthly decline raise concerns.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) reflects this uncertainty.  High P/E and PEG ratios suggest overvaluation.  The previous predictions range from 0.45 to 0.55 for both rise and fall probabilities, highlighting the lack of strong consensus. Considering the positive earnings projections but the negative recent performance and overvaluation, I slightly favor a higher probability of a price fall, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock price movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow by 8.26% year-over-year, and the full-year estimates show solid growth in both EPS and revenue. However, the stock has significantly underperformed the broader market and its sector over the past month, with a 13.77% decline. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) indicates neutral sentiment, and the Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is trading at a premium compared to industry peers. The upcoming earnings report could be a catalyst, but the current valuation metrics and recent underperformance temper optimism. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock has shown a modest gain of 0.53% in the latest trading session but has underperformed the market over the past month with a 13.77% decline. The upcoming earnings report on January 30, 2025, is expected to show positive growth with projected EPS of $2.36 (8.26% increase) and revenue of $124.1 billion (3.78% increase). However, the stock's high Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and PEG ratio of 2.18 suggest it is trading at a premium compared to its industry peers. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) indicates a neutral outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the recent underperformance and high valuation metrics, despite positive earnings projections.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company's earnings expectations for Q1 2025 show positive growth projections with expected EPS of $2.36 (+8.26%) and revenue of $124.1B (+3.78%). However, the recent monthly decline of 13.77% and trailing behind broad market gains suggest investor concern. Furthermore, the company\u2019s valuation metrics like high Forward P/E (29.97) and PEG ratio (2.18) point towards overvaluation. Given the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), there's no strong momentum but there's also no significant negative pressure unless actual earnings miss estimates.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The recent news regarding Apple Inc. indicates a mixed outlook. The company's stock price has shown a modest gain of 0.53% but has significantly underperformed the broader market, falling 13.77% over the past month. Upcoming earnings projections show positive growth in EPS (8.26%) and revenue (3.78%), which could be seen as bullish signals. However, the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) reflects neutral sentiment among analysts, and the stock's high Forward P/E (29.97) and PEG ratio (2.18) suggest it is priced at a premium compared to its peers, indicating potential overvaluation. Given these mixed signals, the balanced assessment leads to a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising due to concerns about its recent underperformance and valuation metrics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). Despite a slight daily gain, it lagged behind market indices and experienced a significant monthly decline compared to its sector and the S&P 500. Upcoming earnings projections show positive growth, but the Zacks Rank remains neutral. The high P/E and PEG ratios suggest overvaluation and analysts' EPS projections remained stagnant, implying negative movement as well. Taking cues from the consistent slightly bearish sentiment in previous rounds, I am factoring that the earnings report release date is comparatively further later, which would result in continued downward movement due to stagnation in investors momentum. These factors influence the stock price to likely fall slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include projected EPS and revenue growth for Q1 2025 and a positive Zacks Industry Rank. However, negative factors outweigh these positives.  Apple's recent performance significantly underperformed the market, with a 13.77% monthly decline.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) indicates neutral sentiment, and high Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest overvaluation.  The previous predictions show a slight leaning towards a price fall,  and taking this into consideration,  the probability of a price fall is considered higher. The upcoming earnings report is a key catalyst; however, the current sentiment and valuation suggest a higher chance of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow by 8.26% year-over-year, and the full-year estimates show solid growth in both EPS and revenue. However, the stock has significantly underperformed the broader market and its sector over the past month, with a 13.77% decline. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) indicates neutral sentiment, and the Forward P/E and PEG ratios suggest the stock is trading at a premium compared to industry peers. The upcoming earnings report could be a catalyst, but the current valuation metrics and recent underperformance temper optimism. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock has shown a modest gain of 0.53% in the latest trading session but has underperformed the market over the past month with a 13.77% decline. The upcoming earnings report on January 30, 2025, is expected to show positive growth with projected EPS of $2.36 (8.26% increase) and revenue of $124.1 billion (3.78% increase). However, the stock's high Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and PEG ratio of 2.18 suggest it is trading at a premium compared to its industry peers. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) indicates a neutral outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the recent underperformance and high valuation metrics, despite positive earnings projections. The trend from previous predictions also leans slightly towards a higher probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's recent performance has been underwhelming, with a 13.77% decline over the past month, and high valuation metrics, including a Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and a PEG ratio of 2.18, suggest the stock is overvalued compared to its peers. However, the upcoming earnings report on January 30, 2025, is expected to show positive growth with projected EPS of $2.36 (8.26% increase) and revenue of $124.1 billion (3.78% increase). Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The previous predictions from various models also leaned towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, which supports this assessment. Therefore, based on the analysis, I estimate a probability of 0.42 for the stock price to rise and 0.58 for it to fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's earnings expectations for Q1 2025 show positive growth projections with expected EPS of $2.36 (+8.26%) and revenue of $124.1B (+3.78%). However, the recent monthly decline of 13.77% and trailing behind broad market gains suggest investor concern. Furthermore, the company\u2019s valuation metrics like high Forward P/E (29.97) and PEG ratio (2.18) point towards overvaluation. Given the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), which suggests a neutral sentiment among analysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the current valuation metrics, recent underperformance, and ongoing market conditions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
