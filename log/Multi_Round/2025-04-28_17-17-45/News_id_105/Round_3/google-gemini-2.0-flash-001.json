(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Apple's current growth prospects, especially with the iPhone 16 and its wearables segment, appear weak. Analyst sentiments indicate that without a strong catalyst, such as robust AI integration, the stock may face downward pressure. Overall, the market perception of Apple's reliance on AI for future growth is cautious, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple's potential growth driven by AI. An analyst doesn't see AI as a significant catalyst for Apple's growth, citing lack of a clear driver for a super cycle. Furthermore, the article highlights concerns about Apple's declining revenue in China and the challenges faced by its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, especially the Vision Pro's high price competing with Meta's offerings. The comparison to Chinese AI models being developed at a fraction of the cost of US companies adds to the negative sentiment. The article clearly focuses on the limitations and challenges that Apple faces and suggests that other AI stocks may be more promising. Therefore, it's more likely the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's future performance concerning AI. While the article highlights Apple's struggles in the AI space and the emergence of cheaper, more competitive AI models from China, it also acknowledges Apple's large market capitalization and established position.  A key point is that an analyst explicitly states they don't believe AI will significantly drive Apple's growth.  Furthermore, the article points to existing weaknesses for Apple, such as declining revenue in China and the lackluster performance of its new products. This negative sentiment, coupled with the analyst's comments, outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's existing strong brand and market position.  The overall tone suggests that the news is more likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short-term, though not drastically given Apple's overall strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors impacting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver, declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables and Home segments, and competitive pressures in the AI and hardware markets. The analyst's comments suggest that AAPL lacks immediate catalysts for growth, and the overall sentiment in the article is cautious. Given the lack of positive drivers and the focus on challenges, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and highlights concerns about its ability to leverage AI as a growth driver. An analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism that AI will significantly impact Apple's stock price, citing the company's need for new catalysts and weak performance in certain segments like China and wearables. Additionally, the article mentions the emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies, which could potentially challenge US tech firms. Given these points, the news seems to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses how Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not expected to benefit significantly from AI technology in the near future, according to analyst Bonawyn Eison. The article also highlights the challenges Apple faces in the Chinese market, weak performance of its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and the high price tag of its Vision Pro. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet. These factors contribute to a negative outlook for Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that Apple is a fully valued company, which might limit the potential downside. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant skepticism regarding AI's role as a catalyst for Apple's growth, with an analyst expressing doubt about AI driving a 'super cycle' for the company. Additionally, the article points to declining revenues in China and challenges in Apple's product segments, particularly in Wearables and the Vision Pro. The presence of lower-cost competitive AI models from China exacerbates concerns about Apple's growth prospects. Overall, the sentiment from multiple analysts suggests a bearish view on AAPL's immediate future, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans heavily towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price. This is primarily driven by the analyst's skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver for Apple, coupled with concerns about declining revenue in China, weak performance in wearables, and competitive pressures from cheaper Chinese AI models. The lack of a clear catalyst, particularly in AI, and the challenges with new products like Vision Pro further contribute to the bearish outlook. While Apple is a large, established company, the consistently negative sentiment suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous models are very consistent around 0.7 probability of stock price falling, and I'll be in line with that, considering that there are no strong counter-arguments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term.  The core argument revolves around the skepticism surrounding AI's potential as a significant growth catalyst for Apple.  Several analysts express doubt that AI will propel Apple to the next level, citing the need for stronger, more impactful drivers.  Furthermore, the article highlights several existing weaknesses for Apple, including declining revenue in China, a critical market; underwhelming performance of the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment; and the high price point of Vision Pro facing strong competition.  The emergence of cheaper, equally competitive AI models from China also adds to the pressure.  While Apple maintains a strong brand and large market capitalization, the lack of immediate growth catalysts and the several specific weaknesses highlighted in the article significantly outweigh any potential positive impact. The consensus among previous predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, further reinforcing this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with skepticism around AI's role as a growth driver, declining revenue in China, and weak performance in key product segments like Wearables and Home. Analyst Bonawyn Eison's comments further underscore concerns about Apple's lack of immediate catalysts for growth. Additionally, the emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese competitors adds competitive pressure. While Apple's strong market position and brand may provide some downside protection, the overall sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of negative impact on the stock price. Previous predictions from other models also align with a bearish outlook, reinforcing the probability of a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article discusses skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver for Apple Inc. (AAPL). An analyst, Bonawyn Eison, states that AI is not a strong enough catalyst to take the company to the next level.

Multiple analysts and models have expressed a negative outlook, citing the lack of a clear growth driver and competitive pressures. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple's potential growth driven by AI, with an analyst stating they don't see AI as a significant catalyst for Apple's growth.

The overall sentiment of the article and the analyst's comments suggest that the news is more likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also estimated a higher probability of the stock price falling, it's reasonable to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of the news indicates significant skepticism regarding AI as a growth driver for Apple Inc. Analysts express concerns about Apple's inability to leverage AI, alongside challenges such as declining revenues in China, weak performance in the Wearables and Mac product segments, and tough competition from cheaper AI models developed by Chinese companies. The prevailing sentiment across multiple assessments leans heavily towards a bearish outlook for AAPL, suggesting that without new catalysts, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from the news article and previous predictions is heavily bearish on Apple's stock. The core issue revolves around skepticism about AI's potential to drive Apple's growth in the near term. An analyst's viewpoint explicitly states that AI isn't seen as a significant catalyst. Additionally, concerns are raised about declining revenue in China, underperforming wearables segments, and increased competition from cheaper AI models developed in China. These negative factors outweigh any potential positives, and the consistent predictions of a stock price decline reinforce this bearish outlook. Given this overwhelming negative sentiment, I have adjusted my prediction slightly to align with the recent trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple's short-term stock performance.  The core concern revolves around the skepticism surrounding AI's potential as a significant growth catalyst, with analysts explicitly stating they don't see AI as a major driver for Apple's future. This skepticism is compounded by several existing weaknesses: declining revenue in China, underwhelming performance in the Wearables and Vision Pro segments, and the emergence of cheaper, competitive AI models from China. While Apple's strong brand and market capitalization provide some cushion, the lack of immediate growth catalysts and the substantial challenges highlighted outweigh any potential positives.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple previous prediction models reinforces this assessment, pointing to a higher probability of a stock price decline.  The near-universal negative predictions from various models across multiple rounds add significant weight to the bearish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc.

(AAPL). An analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses doubt that AI will propel Apple to the next level, citing the need for stronger catalysts. The article also points to declining revenues in China, weak performance in wearables, and competitive pressures from cheaper Chinese AI models. Multiple models and analysts have consistently predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, with probabilities often around 0.7 for a decline. Considering these factors and the consensus from previous predictions, it is reasonable to conclude that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The news article highlights skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver for Apple Inc.
