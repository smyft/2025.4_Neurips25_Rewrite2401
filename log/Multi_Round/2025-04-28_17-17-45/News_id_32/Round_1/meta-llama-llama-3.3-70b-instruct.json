      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's revelation of a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion devices indicates continued customer acquisition, suggesting potential growth opportunities for sales across its product lines. This is a positive sign for investors, as it implies that Apple can further monetize its existing customer base by encouraging them to purchase additional products. Consequently, the likelihood of a stock price increase is elevated. However, being a mature company, there may be some investor concerns about overall market conditions and competition, which introduces a minor possibility of the stock price falling. Overall, the positive customer growth dominates the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates continued growth in Apple's customer base, specifically highlighting the potential for cross-selling within its existing ecosystem.  This suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth. Although Apple is a mature company, the ability to attract new customers and expand within its existing user base is a significant positive factor. However, the market's reaction might be muted due to the already high valuation of Apple's stock.  There are also external factors impacting stock prices not mentioned in this news that could affect the price whether favorably or negatively. Therefore, while the news is positive, the probability of a significant stock price increase is moderate, and the probability of a decrease or stagnation is relatively low. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators typically boost investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. There is no negative information in the news that would suggest a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which is a positive indicator for the company's potential for future growth. The fact that Apple can still convince iPhone owners to buy other Apple devices such as Mac, iPad, or Watch indicates a strong ecosystem and cross-selling opportunities. This information is likely to be viewed positively by investors, leading to an increased likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
