      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Is Still Finding New Customers\nNews Content: Apple is a mature company, and it revealed in its first-quarter earnings call that its installed base of devices had reached over 2.35 billion. The growing number is because Apple is still seeing rapid growth in customers who are new to devices. The numbers suggest that Apple could still have room to grow its base by convincing iPhone owners to buy a Mac, iPad, or Watch.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's revelation of a growing installed base of over 2.35 billion devices indicates continued customer acquisition, suggesting potential growth opportunities for sales across its product lines. This is a positive sign for investors, as it implies that Apple can further monetize its existing customer base by encouraging them to purchase additional products. Consequently, the likelihood of a stock price increase is elevated. However, being a mature company, there may be some investor concerns about overall market conditions and competition, which introduces a minor possibility of the stock price falling. Overall, the positive customer growth dominates the analysis.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates continued growth in Apple's customer base, specifically highlighting the potential for cross-selling within its existing ecosystem.  This suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth. Although Apple is a mature company, the ability to attract new customers and expand within its existing user base is a significant positive factor. However, the market's reaction might be muted due to the already high valuation of Apple's stock.  There are also external factors impacting stock prices not mentioned in this news that could affect the price whether favorably or negatively. Therefore, while the news is positive, the probability of a significant stock price increase is moderate, and the probability of a decrease or stagnation is relatively low. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators typically boost investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. There is no negative information in the news that would suggest a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, which is a positive indicator for the company's potential for future growth. The fact that Apple can still convince iPhone owners to buy other Apple devices such as Mac, iPad, or Watch indicates a strong ecosystem and cross-selling opportunities. This information is likely to be viewed positively by investors, leading to an increased likelihood of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is expanding its customer base with over 2.35 billion devices installed, which reflects strong demand. The mention of growth in attracting new customers and opportunities for cross-selling among existing iPhone users suggests potential revenue growth. Previous predictions highlight a generally positive outlook, with probabilities often favoring a stock price rise. While some concerns about Apple's maturity and external market factors were noted, these appear outweighed by the positive indicators of customer acquisition and ecosystem expansion. Hence, I predict a higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued ability to attract new customers and grow its installed base, suggesting sustained demand and cross-selling opportunities within its ecosystem. This is generally perceived as positive, increasing investor confidence. Most previous models also assigned a high probability to the stock price rising. Taking into consideration these factors, I am assigning a slightly higher likelihood of a price rise, influenced by the recent consistency of positive sentiment in model predictions. There's still a factor for market volatility or unexpected negative information influencing the price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting Apple's continued growth in its installed base and the potential for cross-selling within its ecosystem.  This suggests strong future revenue potential. However,  Apple is a mature company with a high valuation, meaning the market's reaction might be muted. Previous models largely agree on a higher probability of a rise, though the probabilities vary. Considering the positive news and the consensus from previous models, a probability slightly lower than the highest prediction from the previous round is assigned to account for the possibility of muted market reaction due to Apple's mature status and high valuation. The probability of a fall is kept relatively low, reflecting the lack of negative information in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. Such positive growth indicators typically boost investor confidence, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price rise. Previous predictions also indicate a generally positive outlook with higher probabilities of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple is still finding new customers and has a growing installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion. This suggests strong customer acquisition and potential for further growth through cross-selling within its ecosystem. The positive growth indicators and the ability to attract new customers and expand within its existing user base are significant positive factors. However, being a mature company with a high stock valuation, the market's reaction might be moderate. Overall, the positive customer growth and cross-selling opportunities dominate the analysis, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers, with a growing installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. The overall trend from previous predictions also suggests a positive outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive growth indicators and the potential for further growth, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, with a focus on finding new customers. The content emphasizes the company's potential for cross-selling its various devices within the existing ecosystem, which is indicative of positive growth opportunities. While Apple is a mature company, the continuous acquisition of new customers suggests strong demand and potential for further expansion. Although there could be concerns related to market conditions and competition, the overall positive sentiment from this news is more likely to drive investor confidence positively.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The positive financial news about Apple Inc. highlights their capacity to continue acquiring new customers, with their installed base reaching over 2.35 billion devices. This suggests strong demand and indicates potential for further revenue growth through cross-selling additional products within their ecosystem. The overall sentiment from previous predictions supports a high probability of stock price appreciation, as the majority of analyses emphasize the positive growth indicators and potential for cross-selling. While concerns about Apple's maturity and market valuation are acknowledged, the positive factors strongly outweigh these concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued ability to attract new customers, leading to a growing installed base. This suggests sustained demand and opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem, which investors generally perceive as positive. The previous rounds of predictions generally show a consensus that the stock price is likely to increase, with probabilities mostly ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. Considering this trend and the positive nature of the news, I'm assigning a high probability to the stock price rising. However, considering Apple's large market capitalization and potential for other market factors to influence the stock, there is still a reasonable probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is positive, highlighting Apple's continued growth in its installed base and the potential for cross-selling within its ecosystem. This suggests strong future revenue potential.  The consistent positive sentiment across multiple prediction models in previous rounds further reinforces this positive outlook. However, Apple is a mature company with a high valuation, meaning the market's reaction might be muted, preventing an overly optimistic prediction.  The probability of a price fall is low due to the absence of negative information in the news.  My prediction incorporates both the positive news and the consensus from previous models, while also accounting for the possibility of a muted market reaction due to Apple's mature status and high valuation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, driven by new customers and potential for cross-selling within its ecosystem. This is a strong positive indicator for future revenue growth and investor confidence. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently favor a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. While Apple's mature status and high valuation might temper the market's reaction slightly, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be high, with a corresponding low probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple Inc. is still finding new customers, with its installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion. This suggests strong customer acquisition and potential for further growth through cross-selling within its ecosystem. Most previous model predictions have assigned a higher probability to the stock price rising compared to falling, with probabilities generally ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 for a rise and 0.2 to 0.3 for a fall. Considering the positive growth indicators, the ability to attract new customers, and the potential for cross-selling, the outlook is generally positive. However, being a mature company with a high stock valuation, the market's reaction might be moderate. Overall, the positive customer growth and cross-selling opportunities dominate the analysis, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is still finding new customers, with a growing installed base of devices reaching over 2.35 billion. This suggests strong demand and potential for further growth as Apple can cross-sell other products like Mac, iPad, or Watch to existing iPhone users. The overall trend from previous predictions also suggests a positive outlook, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive growth indicators and the potential for further growth, I estimate a high probability of the stock price rising. The consistency of positive sentiment in model predictions across rounds, along with the news highlighting Apple's ability to attract new customers and expand within its existing user base, supports this estimation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's continued growth in its installed base of devices, reaching over 2.35 billion, with a focus on finding new customers.
