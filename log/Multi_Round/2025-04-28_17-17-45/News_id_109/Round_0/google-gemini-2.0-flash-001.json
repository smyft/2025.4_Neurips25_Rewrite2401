(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) stock both jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of their Magnificent Seven peers and providing some respite for tech investors amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names following the release of Chinese firm DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"Apple is reacting positively to the DeepSeek news because smaller more efficient models means it will be able to have better AI products in the iPhone.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI investments. The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) also fell.DeepSeek app on an iPhone.

Apple is set to report earnings after the bell Jan. 30. The majority of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Positive factors include: 1) The stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" stocks amidst an AI sell-off. 2) An analyst suggests that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) could benefit Apple's iPhone AI products. 3) Even venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sees significance in DeepSeek's recent launch. 4) Analyst Buy ratings for AAPL give a target of $246. Negative factors include: 1) The overall negative sentiment towards AI investments in the broader market could affect Apple. 2) Shares remain down 12% from last month, suggesting a weaker near-term trend. 3) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales is also not good. 4) Upcoming earnings report Jan. 30. Given the mixed factors, a slight upward momentum might be expected. Given the good stock movement that day and the analyst's comments, there is reason to believe that AI can make more favorable products for Apple. However, there is evidence to show the iPhone sales aren't great, and the overall AI market investment sentiment is currently negative. With the factors considered, the probabilities are based on the relatively good news, a slightly-better-than-even rising stock price move is predicted.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
