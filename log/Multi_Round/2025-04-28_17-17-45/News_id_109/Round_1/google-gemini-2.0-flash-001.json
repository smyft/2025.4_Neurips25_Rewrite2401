(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) stock both jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of their Magnificent Seven peers and providing some respite for tech investors amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names following the release of Chinese firm DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"Apple is reacting positively to the DeepSeek news because smaller more efficient models means it will be able to have better AI products in the iPhone.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI investments. The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) also fell.DeepSeek app on an iPhone.

Apple is set to report earnings after the bell Jan. 30. The majority of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock has seen a recent jump of over 2% despite a broader market sell-off in technology stocks related to AI. This is largely attributed to positive sentiment about its ability to develop better AI products due to competition from DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models. Analyst support remains strong, with a majority recommending buy, anticipating a rise in the stock price over the next year. However, recent downgrades and a 12% decline in the last month highlight existing concerns about iPhone sales. Balancing these factors, the probability of a price rise seems higher due to positive reactions and future growth potential, while the risk of a fall is mitigated but not entirely absent given recent downgrades and market volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive factors include: 1) The stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks amidst an AI sell-off. 2) An analyst suggests that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) could benefit Apple's iPhone AI products. 3) Even venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sees significance in DeepSeek's recent launch. 4) Analyst Buy ratings for AAPL give a target of $246. Negative factors include: 1) The overall negative sentiment towards AI investments in the broader market could affect Apple. 2) Shares remain down 12% from last month, suggesting a weaker near-term trend. 3) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales is also not good. 4) Upcoming earnings report Jan. 30. Given the mixed factors, a slight upward momentum might be expected. Given the good stock movement that day and the analyst's comments, there is reason to believe that AI can make more favorable products for Apple. However, there is evidence to show the iPhone sales aren't great, and the overall AI market investment sentiment is currently negative. With the factors considered, the probabilities are based on the relatively good news, a slightly-better-than-even rising stock price move is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's stock price rose 2% following news of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. This is because a more efficient AI model benefits Apple by enabling the creation of better AI products for the iPhone, potentially boosting sales.  The analyst quote directly supports this positive outlook.  However, counteracting this positive news are recent downgrades due to struggling iPhone sales and the overall uncertainty surrounding AI investments given DeepSeek's breakthrough.  While the positive news is impactful in the short term, the longer-term uncertainty related to iPhone sales and the broader AI market warrants caution.  Therefore, while the probability of a rise is higher due to the immediate positive reaction, the inherent risk factors mean the probability isn't overwhelmingly high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's stock rising by more than 2% on Monday, driven by positive sentiment around cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's AI products in the iPhone. Analysts also view this as a positive development for Apple's future AI capabilities. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also impact the stock price. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive AI-driven optimism but weaker fundamentals and downgrades\u2014the probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the news, but significant uncertainty remains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of its 'Magnificent Seven' peers amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names. The positive reaction is attributed to the release of a cost-effective AI model by DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's AI products on the iPhone. Despite the recent stock rise, Apple's shares are still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and AI smartphone and PC traction. The majority of analysts recommend buying the stock with a target of $246 over the next 12 months. Apple's upcoming earnings report on January 30 may also influence stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's stock price rose 2% on Monday due to the release of DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which could lead to better AI products in the iPhone. Additionally, Meta Platforms' plans to invest $65 billion in AI this year and the potential efficiency gains available to future AI models could also positively impact Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales, and the company was hit with two downgrades last week. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but still uncertain due to the mixed signals.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
