(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) stock both jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of their Magnificent Seven peers and providing some respite for tech investors amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names following the release of Chinese firm DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"Apple is reacting positively to the DeepSeek news because smaller more efficient models means it will be able to have better AI products in the iPhone.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI investments. The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%.

Apple is set to report earnings after the bell Jan. 30. The majority of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock has seen a recent jump of over 2% despite a broader market sell-off in technology stocks related to AI. This is largely attributed to positive sentiment about its ability to develop better AI products due to competition from DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models. Analyst support remains strong, with a majority recommending buy, anticipating a rise in the stock price over the next year. However, recent downgrades and a 12% decline in the last month highlight existing concerns about iPhone sales. Balancing these factors, the probability of a price rise seems higher due to positive reactions and future growth potential, while the risk of a fall is mitigated but not entirely absent given recent downgrades and market volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive factors include: 1) The stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks amidst an AI sell-off. 2) An analyst suggests that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) could benefit Apple's iPhone AI products. 3) Even venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sees significance in DeepSeek's recent launch. 4) Analyst Buy ratings for AAPL give a target of $246. Negative factors include: 1) The overall negative sentiment towards AI investments in the broader market could affect Apple. 2) Shares remain down 12% from last month, suggesting a weaker near-term trend. 3) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales is also not good. 4) Upcoming earnings report Jan. 30. Given the mixed factors, a slight upward momentum might be expected. Given the good stock movement that day and the analyst's comments, there is reason to believe that AI can make more favorable products for Apple. However, there is evidence to show the iPhone sales aren't great, and the overall AI market investment sentiment is currently negative. With the factors considered, the probabilities are based on the relatively good news, a slightly-better-than-even rising stock price move is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's stock price rose 2% following news of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. This is because a more efficient AI model benefits Apple by enabling the creation of better AI products for the iPhone, potentially boosting sales.  The analyst quote directly supports this positive outlook.  However, counteracting this positive news are recent downgrades due to struggling iPhone sales and the overall uncertainty surrounding AI investments given DeepSeek's breakthrough.  While the positive news is impactful in the short term, the longer-term uncertainty related to iPhone sales and the broader AI market warrants caution.  Therefore, while the probability of a rise is higher due to the immediate positive reaction, the inherent risk factors mean the probability isn't overwhelmingly high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's stock rising by more than 2% on Monday, driven by positive sentiment around cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's AI products in the iPhone. Analysts also view this as a positive development for Apple's future AI capabilities. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also impact the stock price. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive AI-driven optimism but weaker fundamentals and downgrades\u2014the probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the news, but significant uncertainty remains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of its 'Magnificent Seven' peers amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names. The positive reaction is attributed to the release of a cost-effective AI model by DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's AI products on the iPhone. Despite the recent stock rise, Apple's shares are still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and AI smartphone and PC traction. The majority of analysts recommend buying the stock with a target of $246 over the next 12 months. Apple's upcoming earnings report on January 30 may also influence stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's stock price rose 2% on Monday due to the release of DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which could lead to better AI products in the iPhone. Additionally, Meta Platforms' plans to invest $65 billion in AI this year and the potential efficiency gains available to future AI models could also positively impact Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales, and the company was hit with two downgrades last week. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but still uncertain due to the mixed signals.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock rose over 2% as a positive reaction to DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model, which is expected to enhance its AI capabilities, particularly in the iPhone. Positive analyst sentiment and a majority buy recommendation further support an optimistic outlook. However, concerns remain due to a 12% decline in the stock over the past month, recent downgrades related to struggling iPhone sales, and a negative sentiment in the broader AI market. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 might also impact the stock's movement. Balancing these factors leads to a slightly more favorable view towards a rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The stock saw a 2% jump, driven by optimism surrounding DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and its potential to enhance AI capabilities in iPhones. This is supported by an analyst's positive view. However, Apple's recent performance has been weak, with shares down 12% in the last month due to struggling iPhone sales and downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. The overall sentiment towards AI investment appears cautious, compounded by the upcoming earnings report where poor performance could further negatively impact the stock. Taking historical analysis into account, the models generally took on a positive stance. Given these countervailing factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly favored, with existing bearish factors holding more influence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The immediate positive reaction to DeepSeek's AI model, boosting Apple's stock by over 2%, is significant and suggests short-term optimism. Analyst Luria's comment about improved iPhone AI products further supports this.  The large investment in AI by Meta also indirectly points toward a positive trend for AI-related companies. However, several factors temper this optimism.  The 12% drop in Apple's stock price over the past month, along with two recent downgrades citing struggling iPhone sales, signals underlying weakness. The overall negative market sentiment towards AI investments, due to DeepSeek's cost-effective model undercutting competitors, creates additional uncertainty.  While the positive news is impactful and suggests short-term gains, the substantial concerns regarding iPhone sales and the broader market shift remain. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty.  Considering the short-term positive reaction against a background of long-term concerns, a slightly higher probability of a rise is assigned, but the uncertainty is reflected in probabilities not far from 0.5.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the stock rose 2% on Monday, driven by optimism around DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which could enhance Apple's AI capabilities in the iPhone. Analyst sentiment remains bullish, with a majority recommending a buy and a target price of $246. However, there are significant negatives: Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to weak iPhone sales, recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, and broader market volatility in AI-related stocks. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 adds further uncertainty. Balancing these factors, the probability of a short-term rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the AI news, but the downside risks (sales weakness, downgrades) keep the probability from being significantly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock jumped more than 2% on Monday, driven by positive sentiment around DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which could enhance Apple's AI products in the iPhone. Analysts view this as a positive development for Apple's future AI capabilities. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also impact the stock price. Considering the mixed signals\u2014positive AI-driven optimism but weaker fundamentals and downgrades\u2014the probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the news, but significant uncertainty remains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks amidst an AI sell-off, due to positive sentiment around cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's AI products in the iPhone. Analysts also view this as a positive development for Apple's future AI capabilities. On the other hand, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also impact the stock price. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive AI-driven optimism but weaker fundamentals and downgrades\u2014the probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the news, but significant uncertainty remains. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which mostly estimated a probability of stock price rise around 0.6, this analysis leans towards a similar estimation, taking into account the positive impact of DeepSeek's AI model and the overall optimism despite current challenges.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive reaction from Apple's stock, rising over 2%, driven by the cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek and the associated benefits for iPhone AI products as noted by DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria. Despite this positive development, there are notable concerns such as the ongoing decline of 12% in the last month due to struggling iPhone sales, recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, and upcoming earnings reports on January 30. The majority of analysts still recommend buying the stock with a target of $246 over the next 12 months, reflecting long-term confidence. Balancing the recent positive reactions and investor sentiments against the current negative market trends and short-term concerns, the immediate impact appears positive but carries underlying risks.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction from Apple (AAPL) stock, which rose over 2% due to optimism surrounding DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model that could enhance Apple's AI capabilities. Analyst sentiment supports a buy recommendation, with a target price of $246. However, the stock is still down 12% from the previous month, affected by struggles in iPhone sales and recent downgrades. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty. While the immediate reaction to the news is positive, the underlying concerns may suppress overwhelming optimism. Balancing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability for the stock to rise compared to falling, but with significant uncertainty remaining.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The stock jumped 2% on Monday, fueled by optimism around DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and its potential benefits for Apple's iPhone AI capabilities. This is further supported by analyst comments and Meta's significant AI investments which indirectly benefits Apple. However, there are significant counterforces. Apple's stock is down 12% from last month due to poor iPhone sales, and the company has received downgrades. The overall AI market sentiment is turning cautious. While the immediate reaction is positive, the underlying fundamentals appear weak. Taking into consideration the previous round of predictions, most models initially gave a probability of rise around 0.6. However, in the following round, most models seem to have revised their predictions downward to around 0.55-0.62. Therefore, considering the mixed signals and the downward trend of other models' beliefs, I will give a slightly lower probability for the stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: Apple's stock price reaction to the DeepSeek news is positive in the short term, reflected by the 2% jump.  This is driven by the potential for cost-effective AI to improve Apple's iPhone offerings, as highlighted by analyst comments.  However, several countervailing factors temper this optimism.  The stock is already down 12% this month due to weak iPhone sales, and analysts have issued downgrades, indicating underlying concerns. The broader AI market sell-off also casts a shadow on short-term prospects. While the DeepSeek news provides a short-term boost, the underlying issues of iPhone sales and market sentiment are unlikely to resolve immediately. The upcoming earnings report adds another layer of uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, which mostly hover around a 0.6 probability of a price rise, a slightly more conservative estimate is warranted. The probability of a price rise is likely tempered by the existing negative factors, although the positive news suggests it's still more likely to rise than fall in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the stock rising over 2% on Monday due to optimism around DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which could enhance Apple's AI capabilities in the iPhone. Analyst sentiment remains bullish, with a majority recommending a buy and a target price of $246. However, negatives include a 12% decline in the stock over the past month due to weak iPhone sales, recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, and broader market volatility in AI-related stocks. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 adds further uncertainty. Balancing these factors, the probability of a short-term rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the AI news, but the downside risks (sales weakness, downgrades) keep the probability from being significantly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The stock saw a 2% jump on Monday, driven by optimism surrounding DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and its potential to enhance AI capabilities in iPhones. This positive reaction is supported by analyst sentiment, with a majority recommending a buy and a target price of $246. However, concerns remain due to a 12% decline in the stock over the past month, recent downgrades related to struggling iPhone sales, and a cautious sentiment in the broader AI market. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 may also impact the stock's movement. Balancing these factors, the probability of a short-term rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the AI news, but uncertainty remains due to weaker fundamentals and market volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL), with a 2% stock rise on Monday driven by optimism around DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which could enhance Apple's AI products in the iPhone. Analysts view this as a positive development for Apple's future AI capabilities. However, Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 could also impact the stock price. Considering the mixed signals\u2014positive AI-driven optimism but weaker fundamentals and downgrades\u2014the probability of a rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the news, but significant uncertainty remains. Previous predictions from various models also estimated a probability of stock price rise around 0.6, which supports this analysis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive reaction from Apple's stock, rising over 2%, driven by the cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek and the associated benefits for iPhone AI products as noted by DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria. Despite this positive development, there are notable concerns such as the ongoing decline of 12% in the last month due to struggling iPhone sales, recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, and upcoming earnings reports on January 30. The majority of analysts still recommend buying the stock with a target of $246 over the next 12 months, reflecting long-term confidence. Balancing the recent positive reactions and investor sentiments against the current negative market trends and short-term concerns, the immediate impact appears positive but carries underlying risks.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's stock saw a 2% rise due to positive sentiment regarding DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, which analysts believe could enhance Apple's AI capabilities for iPhones. Despite this positive movement, the stock is down 12% from last month, influenced by weak iPhone sales and recent analyst downgrades. There's cautious sentiment surrounding overall AI investments, and Apple's upcoming earnings report may further affect stock dynamics. Balancing the immediate positive reaction from the news against ongoing concerns about sales performance and market volatility points towards a slightly optimistic outlook for the stock in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Apple's stock experienced a 2% increase following news of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and Meta's AI investment plans, suggesting potential benefits for Apple's AI capabilities. Analyst sentiment remains generally positive with 'buy' recommendations and a target price of $246. However, the stock is still down 12% over the past month due to struggling iPhone sales, recent downgrades, and broader AI market volatility. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 introduces additional uncertainty. Furthermore, the previous rounds of predictions indicated a downward trend for the stock price rising probability, from 0.65 in round 0, to 0.58 in round 2. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly diminished probability for a stock price increase. Although the immediate reaction might be positive, prevailing concerns due to declining sales and market uncertainties constrain overwhelming bullishness. These elements taken together result in a probability of the price rising slightly above 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  A short-term positive reaction (2% jump) is fueled by optimism surrounding DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and its potential to boost iPhone AI features. Analyst comments and Meta's large AI investment indirectly support this. However, countervailing factors are significant: Apple's stock is down 12% this month due to weak iPhone sales and downgrades. The broader AI market sentiment is cautious. The upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty.  While the immediate reaction is positive, the underlying fundamentals appear weak. Considering the previous predictions, which started around 0.6 probability of a rise and trended slightly downward,  I'm assigning a lower probability of a rise than many of the initial models.  The balance between short-term positive sentiment and longer-term concerns about iPhone sales and overall market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of a fall than a significant rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Analyst sentiment remains bullish, with a majority recommending a buy and a target price of $246. However, there are significant negatives: Apple's stock is still down 12% from last month due to weak iPhone sales, recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, and broader market volatility in AI-related stocks. The upcoming earnings report on Jan. 30 adds further uncertainty. Balancing these factors, the probability of a short-term rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the AI news, but the downside risks (sales weakness, downgrades) keep the probability from being significantly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

The upcoming earnings report on January 30 may also impact the stock's movement. Balancing these factors, the probability of a short-term rise is slightly higher due to the immediate positive reaction to the AI news, but uncertainty remains due to weaker fundamentals and market volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The news article reports a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with the stock rising over 2% on Monday due to optimism surrounding DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. However, the stock is still down 12% from last month due to struggling iPhone sales and recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital. The majority of analysts recommend buying the stock with a target price of $246 over the next 12 months. Considering the mixed signals, including the positive reaction to the AI news, weaker fundamentals, and market volatility, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The previous predictions from various models also support this analysis, with most estimating a probability of stock price rise around 0.6. Therefore, I will predict a probability of stock price rise slightly above 0.6, taking into account the positive impact of DeepSeek's AI model and the overall optimism despite current challenges.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a positive reaction from Apple's (AAPL) stock, rising over 2%, driven by the release of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model. This cost-effective AI model is expected to enhance Apple's AI capabilities, particularly in the iPhone. Several positive factors include a majority of buy recommendations from analysts with a target price of $246, and potential efficiency gains due to Meta Platforms' investment in AI. However, there are notable concerns such as the ongoing decline of 12% in the last month due to struggling iPhone sales, recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, and upcoming earnings reports on January 30. Given the overall mix of positive and negative factors, and considering that previous predictions from various models have consistently estimated a probability of stock price rise around 0.6, I maintain a slightly positive outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
