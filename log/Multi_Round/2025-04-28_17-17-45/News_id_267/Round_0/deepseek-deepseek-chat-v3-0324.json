(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple pauses AI-generated news alerts over inaccuracy issues\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) has paused its artificial intelligence (AI) tool that summarises news headlines after a number of errors drew complaints from news organisations and campaigners.\n\nOn Thursday, the tech giant released a beta software update to developers which disabled the AI feature for news and entertainment headlines \u2013 an update that will eventually reach all users \u2013 and said it was working on improvements for the tool.\n\nThe feature is part of the iPhone maker\u2019s Apple Intelligence tools it launched late last year \u2013 the company\u2019s first major steps into generative AI technology, which has become the biggest trend in the industry over the last two years since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nAccording to tech industry website MacRumors, Apple has temporarily disabled the tool for the news and entertainment categories while it works on improvements but plans to bring them back in a future software update.\n\nIn addition, its report said Apple has added a warning below the notification summaries switch in the Settings app which warns users that it is a beta feature and that \u201csummaries may contain errors\u201d.\n\nThe aim of the notification summaries tool was to group together a string of notifications from individual apps into a single, quick, bite-size alert to help users save time.\n\nHowever, a number of news organisations have raised concerns or complained directly to Apple since the tool was launched after a number of incidents where it created false headlines when attempting to summarise news stories.\n\nMany had also urged the tech giant to suspend its use of the feature, and a number of press freedom groups have also spoken out about the tool, warning that it posed a risk to people attempting to seek out reliable information.\n\nIn December, the BBC complained to Apple about the tool after it created a number of false headlines based on BBC news app alerts, including one stating that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealth (UNH) chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself.\n\nIn response to that complaint, Apple told the BBC earlier this month that an update to Apple Intelligence would be rolled out \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, and also noted that using the summarisation feature was optional.\n\nApple has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
