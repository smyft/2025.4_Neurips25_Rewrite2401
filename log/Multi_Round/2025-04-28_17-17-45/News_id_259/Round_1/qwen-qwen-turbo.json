(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates significant regulatory uncertainty impacting major tech companies like Apple. The uproar regarding a potential ban on TikTok, which could lead to Apple's removal of the app from its store and inability to provide updates, suggests a negative sentiment among investors. Although there is a possibility of regulatory changes that could favor TikTok, the immediate implications of the ban could generate concerns about user engagement and revenue impacts for Apple. Therefore, the probability of stock price falling outweighs the probability of it rising, given the uncertainties introduced by the ban.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban in the US introduces several uncertainties that could impact Apple's stock price. On one hand, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could be seen as a slight negative, as it may generate less revenue for Apple. However, the possibility of the app becoming vulnerable to cyber-attacks if not maintained, as the news article describes, could increase user interest in Apple's stronger security protocols, offering a potential indirect benefit. Also, the uncertainty surrounding the ban, Trump's potential interventions, and the possibility of a sale create both risks and opportunities. The news points to a variety of outcomes, so the overall impact to Apple is not substantially one-way, either positively or negatively. However, there is slightly more downside risk than upside potential for Apple given the complexities detailed in the news article. I would assess that there's a slightly higher chance that the news would trigger a small decline in stock price versus a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok from US app stores on January 19th, impacting Apple's ability to host the app.  While the immediate effect might be minimal, the long-term consequences are uncertain.  If TikTok is completely removed and not replaced,  it could slightly negatively impact Apple's App Store revenue in the long run. However, the impact is likely to be small, given Apple's vast app ecosystem.  The article also highlights several potential scenarios, including a last-minute reprieve from the incoming President, a sale of TikTok's US operations, or even a delay in enforcement.  The uncertainty surrounding the situation and the possibility that the ban may not materialize or be short-lived reduces the likelihood of a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price.  The potential for other positive news or overall market trends could easily outweigh this specific event.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price drop is considered relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL), as Apple would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store if the ban is enforced. While this could lead to a minor negative impact on Apple's revenue from App Store fees, the overall effect on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. Apple's business is diversified across hardware, services, and other apps, and the loss of TikTok, while notable, is not a significant portion of its revenue. Additionally, the uncertainty around the ban's enforcement (potential delays or reversals) further reduces the immediate negative impact. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise or fall due to this news is relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. The ban primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok through its App Store means it must comply with the law, potentially leading to a loss of a popular app for users. This could marginally affect Apple's services revenue and user engagement. However, given that TikTok's removal is more of a regulatory compliance issue rather than a reflection on Apple's performance or future prospects, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is expected to be limited. The news does not provide a strong catalyst for either a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications on tech giants like Apple. The ban would require Apple to remove TikTok from its app store, which could affect the company's revenue and user engagement. However, the article also mentions that President-elect Donald Trump might take actions to save TikTok, which could mitigate the negative impact on Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is lower than the probability of it falling. The company's stock price might fall due to the potential loss of revenue and user engagement, but the possibility of Trump's intervention and the fact that the app won't 'magically disappear' from phones might limit the downside.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
