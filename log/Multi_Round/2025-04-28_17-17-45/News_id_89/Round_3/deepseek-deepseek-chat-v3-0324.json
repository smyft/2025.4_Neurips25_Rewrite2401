(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\nNews Content: This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's earnings revisions remain stable, but the company has underperformed relative to the S&P 500 and has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), showing bearish sentiments among analysts. While there are expectations of slight growth in China sales and a robust Services segment, there is also skepticism regarding the iPhone's performance and the overall growth narrative of the company. Given these mixed signals, the probability of stock price decline is higher than that of rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the EPS estimate suggests 8% year-over-year growth, top-line growth has been stagnant. Key metrics to watch include China sales (previously a weak point, now showing potential positive YoY change), Services revenue (historically robust but with a recent miss), and iPhone sales influenced by the adoption of Apple Intelligence. The article highlights analyst bearishness with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating. The outcome hinges on commentary, guidance, and Apple Intelligence adoption. A combination of factors, including slight positive projections offset by overall bearish sentiment leads to an expectation of marginally higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows 8% year-over-year growth and Services are expected to perform strongly (14% year-over-year growth), several factors suggest potential downside.  Apple's overall growth is slowing, and the China market remains a significant concern despite predicted positive year-over-year growth.  The success of Apple Intelligence is uncertain and crucial to the company's future. The stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates analyst bearishness.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price increase is lower than the probability of a price decrease, although neither is overwhelmingly likely due to the overall uncertainty. The positive China growth forecast and strong Services segment mitigate the risk of a sharp decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) financial news suggests mixed signals. On the positive side, Apple's Services segment is expected to show robust growth (14% year-over-year), and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the overall earnings and sales revisions have been stagnant, with minimal growth in EPS (8% year-over-year) and top-line (3.7% year-over-year). The stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. Key concerns include the performance in China, which has been weak historically, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings will likely hinge on guidance and commentary, particularly around China and Services. The stagnant growth and bearish analyst sentiment weigh more heavily, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and its potential impact on the stock price. Apple's stock has had a rough start to 2025, down 8% and underperforming the S&P 500. The earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. Key metrics to watch include China's sales results, Services segment momentum, and iPhone sales, especially related to Apple Intelligence. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearishness among analysts. Given the mixed expectations and the stock's recent performance, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling if the earnings report does not meet expectations or provide strong guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down roughly 8%. Analysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. However, the company's top-line growth has been cooling, and its China results have been a concern. The article highlights the importance of watching Apple's China results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the mixed expectations and the company's current underperformance, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple, with unchanged EPS estimates showing 8% year-over-year growth and the Services segment expected to perform well. However, the overall growth narrative appears stagnant, and significant concerns remain regarding China's performance and the impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales. The prevailing Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) reflects a bearish sentiment among analysts. Given these mixed signals and the company's recent underperformance, there is a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The overall sentiment leans bearish, which aligns with the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating and the stock's underperformance. While the forecast of positive YoY growth in China and the strength of the Services segment offer some positive elements, the stagnation in top-line growth and skepticism surrounding the iPhone sales and Apple Intelligence are significant concerns. Given the trend of slightly negative predictions and the consistently higher probability of a stock price fall in the previous round, I predict a slight increase in the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While there's potential for growth in the Services segment and a possible turnaround in China sales, several factors point towards a higher likelihood of a price fall.  The overall growth is slowing, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects significant analyst bearishness, and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65.  While the positive projections for China and Services offer some mitigating factors, the prevailing bearish sentiment and uncertainty surrounding key growth drivers outweigh the positives.  Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price decline, though less extreme than some of the previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are positive aspects such as expected growth in EPS (8% year-over-year) and robust performance in the Services segment (14% year-over-year), there are significant concerns. Apple's stock has underperformed the S&P 500, down 8% in 2025, and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. Key risks include stagnant top-line growth, ongoing challenges in China (despite a forecasted positive year-over-year change), and skepticism around Apple Intelligence's impact on iPhone sales. The overall sentiment leans bearish, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline post-earnings.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple's stock price movement. On the positive side, the Services segment is expected to show robust growth (14% year-over-year), and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. However, the overall earnings and sales revisions have been stagnant, with minimal growth in EPS (8% year-over-year) and top-line (3.7% year-over-year). The stock is currently rated as a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. Additionally, concerns about Apple's growth narrative, particularly in China, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence's impact on sales contribute to a cautious outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than that of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial news presents mixed signals. While the company's Services segment is expected to show robust growth and China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters, the overall earnings and sales revisions have been stagnant. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts. Considering the mixed expectations, the recent underperformance of the stock, and the uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple Intelligence, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are indications of potential growth in the Services segment and a forecast of the first positive year-over-year change in China sales, concerns about overall stagnant growth, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment among analysts, and skepticism surrounding Apple Intelligence's impact on iPhone sales lead to a cautious outlook. The recent underperformance of the stock and the mixed signals contribute to the expectation of a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple remains mixed, but leans slightly bearish. While there are positive indicators like the forecasted growth in China sales and the robust Services segment, concerns persist about overall stagnant growth. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) continues to reflect analyst bearishness. Previous predictions consistently assign a higher probability to a stock price fall. The uncertainty surrounding Apple Intelligence's impact and the general market skepticism further contribute to the potential downside. The previous rounds of predictions also demonstrate a consistent leaning towards a stock price fall. Considering these information, slight more weight will be given to the falling probability to represent the trend of beliefs. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include expected growth in the Services segment (14% YoY) and a potential turnaround in China sales (first positive YoY change in several quarters). However, several negative factors outweigh these positives.  Overall growth is slowing, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates significant analyst bearishness, and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The previous predictions consistently favor a price decline, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.65. While the positive projections for China and Services offer some mitigation, the prevailing bearish sentiment and uncertainty surrounding key growth drivers dominate. The stagnant top-line growth and the company's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 further reinforce the bearish outlook.  Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Key concerns include the performance in China, which has been weak historically, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Given these factors, the stock's movement post-earnings will likely hinge on guidance and commentary, particularly around China and Services. The stagnant growth and bearish analyst sentiment weigh more heavily, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.41, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.59, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
