The data shows consistent decreases across all quarters, with a particularly sharp 25% drop in Q4. This suggests potential issues with market demand and competition from companies like Huawei and Vivo, likely leading to negative investor sentiment and pressure on Apple's stock price. Hence, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a crucial market for the company. A 17% annual shipment decrease and a 25% drop in Q4 are concerning. Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share further exacerbates the negative sentiment. While other news items mention a new store opening in China and discussions regarding credit card agreements, the overwhelming negative impact of the sales decline in China is likely to outweigh any positive effects. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China across all four quarters of 2024, with a particularly sharp drop of 25% in Q4.  This represents a substantial loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. China is a major market for Apple, and this decline indicates weaker-than-expected performance in a key region. While Apple is a large and diversified company, the substantial drop in iPhone sales in China is likely to negatively impact overall revenue and profitability. This negative news is likely to exert downward pressure on the stock price.  However, the market may have already priced in some negative expectations, and the reaction might be less dramatic than the raw numbers suggest.  The probability of a price rise is therefore lower, while the probability of a price fall is higher, though not necessarily overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decrease in Q4 alone. This loss in market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests potential revenue and profitability challenges for Apple in the region. Such negative performance in a major market is likely to concern investors, leading to a bearish sentiment around the stock in the short term. However, Apple's diversified product lineup and global presence might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the magnitude of the sales decline reported, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a 17% decline in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This indicates a significant decline in Apple's market performance in China, a crucial market for the company. Furthermore, Huawei and Vivo have overtaken Apple in market share, suggesting increased competition. Given this negative sales performance and loss of market share, it is likely that Apple's stock price will be negatively impacted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a 17% decline in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on the company's revenue and market position. As a result, the stock price is likely to fall. However, it's also important to consider that Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may mitigate the impact of this decline. Nevertheless, the immediate reaction to this news is likely to be negative, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, the world's largest smartphone market. This drop affects not only quarterly shipments but also yearly performance, leading to a substantial market share loss compared to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. Such negative performance in a critical region is likely to impact investor confidence negatively, as regional sales often play a crucial role in overall financial health and growth expectations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a sharp 25% decline in Q4 alone. This consistent downturn, particularly in such a crucial market for Apple, is likely to lead to negative investor sentiment. The loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo exacerbates these concerns, signaling potential challenges for the company's revenue and long-term growth prospects. Given the consensus view among various predictive models indicating a predominant expectation of a stock price fall, I align with this sentiment. Although Apple remains a strong and diversified company, the immediate impacts of these sales declines suggest a higher likelihood of a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The consistent negative performance of Apple's iPhone sales in China across all four quarters, culminating in a significant 17% annual decline and a 25% drop in Q4, strongly suggests a bearish outlook. The loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo further exacerbates this concern. While Apple is a large, established company with diversified operations, the substantial downturn in a crucial market like China poses a significant threat to revenue and investor confidence. Considering the prior predictions consistently leaned towards a stock price decline and this new data reinforces that negative trend, I will continue supporting the negative predictions. Therefore I will provide higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news of a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China across all four quarters of 2024, culminating in a 25% drop in Q4 and a 17% overall annual decline, presents a strongly negative outlook.  This is exacerbated by Huawei and Vivo surpassing Apple in market share.  Previous model predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall. While Apple is a diversified company, the substantial drop in sales from a key market like China will likely negatively impact investor sentiment.  The magnitude of the decline and the loss of market share outweigh any potentially positive news, such as the new store opening or credit card discussions.  Although some of the negative impact might already be reflected in the current stock price due to prior market expectations or anticipation of declining sales, the additional confirmation of this poor performance would likely result in further downward pressure.  Considering the consistent negative predictions from previous models and the severity of the sales decline, I assign a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a critical market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decrease in Q4. This loss in market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests potential revenue and profitability challenges for Apple in the region. Such negative performance in a major market is likely to concern investors, leading to a bearish sentiment around the stock in the short term. While Apple's diversified product lineup and global presence might mitigate some of the negative impact, the magnitude of the sales decline reported suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% annual drop in shipments and a 25% decrease in Q4 sales. This decline has resulted in Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share. Given that China is a critical market for Apple, this negative performance is likely to impact investor confidence and the company's revenue and profitability. The consistent decline across all four quarters suggests a trend that may not be easily reversed. While Apple's diversified product lineup and global presence might mitigate some of the negative impact, the immediate reaction to this news is likely to be negative. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decrease in Q4 alone. This loss in market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests potential revenue and profitability challenges for Apple in the region. Given the magnitude of the sales decline reported and the consistency of negative predictions from other models, it is likely that the stock price will be negatively impacted. However, considering Apple's diversified product lineup and global presence, the impact might be mitigated to some extent. The previous predictions from various models indicate a consensus towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8, with some models attributing a 0.2 probability to the stock price rising. Given this information and the trend of others' beliefs, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, an extremely important market for the company. With a 17% annual drop in shipments and a 25% drop in Q4, alongside competitors like Huawei and Vivo surpassing Apple in market share, this indicates increasing competitive pressure. This negative performance in China, where Apple has historically performed well, is likely to significantly impact investor sentiment and potentially lead to reduced earnings projections. The strong consensus among other models supports a higher probability of stock price decline due to these factors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
