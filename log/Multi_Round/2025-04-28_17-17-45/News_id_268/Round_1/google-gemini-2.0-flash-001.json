The data shows consistent decreases across all quarters, with a particularly sharp 25% drop in Q4. This suggests potential issues with market demand and competition from companies like Huawei and Vivo, likely leading to negative investor sentiment and pressure on Apple's stock price. Hence, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a crucial market for the company. A 17% annual shipment decrease and a 25% drop in Q4 are concerning. Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share further exacerbates the negative sentiment. While other news items mention a new store opening in China and discussions regarding credit card agreements, the overwhelming negative impact of the sales decline in China is likely to outweigh any positive effects. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China across all four quarters of 2024, with a particularly sharp drop of 25% in Q4.  This represents a substantial loss of market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. China is a major market for Apple, and this decline indicates weaker-than-expected performance in a key region. While Apple is a large and diversified company, the substantial drop in iPhone sales in China is likely to negatively impact overall revenue and profitability. This negative news is likely to exert downward pressure on the stock price.  However, the market may have already priced in some negative expectations, and the reaction might be less dramatic than the raw numbers suggest.  The probability of a price rise is therefore lower, while the probability of a price fall is higher, though not necessarily overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a key market, with a 17% annual drop and a 25% decrease in Q4 alone. This loss in market share to competitors like Huawei and Vivo suggests potential revenue and profitability challenges for Apple in the region. Such negative performance in a major market is likely to concern investors, leading to a bearish sentiment around the stock in the short term. However, Apple's diversified product lineup and global presence might mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the magnitude of the sales decline reported, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a 17% decline in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This indicates a significant decline in Apple's market performance in China, a crucial market for the company. Furthermore, Huawei and Vivo have overtaken Apple in market share, suggesting increased competition. Given this negative sales performance and loss of market share, it is likely that Apple's stock price will be negatively impacted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news report states that Apple's iPhone sales fell in all four quarters in China, with a 17% decline in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on the company's revenue and market position. As a result, the stock price is likely to fall. However, it's also important to consider that Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may mitigate the impact of this decline. Nevertheless, the immediate reaction to this news is likely to be negative, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, the world's largest smartphone market. This drop affects not only quarterly shipments but also yearly performance, leading to a substantial market share loss compared to competitors like Huawei and Vivo. Such negative performance in a critical region is likely to impact investor confidence negatively, as regional sales often play a crucial role in overall financial health and growth expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
