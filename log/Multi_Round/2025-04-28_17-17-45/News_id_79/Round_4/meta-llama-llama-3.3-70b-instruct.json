      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall sentiment in the market appears cautiously optimistic around major tech earnings, particularly with the Nasdaq and S&P futures rising. Investors seem to be recovering from previous concerns linked to a low-cost AI model from a Chinese start-up. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7', which has historically driven significant market gains, despite recent fluctuations. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates, which may alleviate some market pressures. While some uncertainty remains from the recent AI model's implications on capital expenditures, the overall atmosphere ahead of Apple's earnings is positioned positively. Therefore, there is a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Positive aspects include the overall uptick in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, indicating a generally positive market sentiment. Further, the recovery in tech stocks after the DeepSeek AI model scare is encouraging. ASML's strong performance also suggests continued robust demand in the semiconductor sector, which bodes well for Apple's supply chain. However, looming over Apple specifically, the news mentions disappointing sales growth in the luxury goods titan LVMH. It casts slight shadows toward the demand of some premium products. The key event is Apple's upcoming earnings report and the market's reaction to it. The Fed's anticipated decision to hold rates steady is largely priced in, but Powell's commentary could influence market sentiment, but it may not directly affect Apple. Given these countervailing factors, the probability of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price is reasonably balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is mixed and doesn't provide a strong indicator for a definitive price movement for AAPL.  Positive factors include the overall upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P futures, and the strong performance of ASML, a key player in the semiconductor industry.  This suggests positive overall market sentiment, which could benefit Apple. However, the upcoming earnings announcement is a key catalyst for price movement. The report may be affected by the concerns around AI spending raised by the DeepSeek model and doubts about tech companies' stated billions in AI investments. The Fed's decision is mostly expected to be neutral, although the press conference could introduce uncertainty.  Overall, the market seems to be showing some resilience against the earlier sell-off but the upcoming Apple earnings report carries significant weight.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a mix of positive and negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Nasdaq and S&P futures are higher, indicating a rebound in tech stocks after earlier declines. Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' tech firms reporting earnings, and the overall tech sector is recovering from the DeepSeek AI model scare. The Federal Reserve's expected unchanged interest rates could provide stability. However, there are concerns about AI spending and broader market volatility. Given Apple's strong position and the positive sentiment in tech earnings, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided financial news indicates a mixed but generally positive outlook for tech stocks, particularly with the earnings reports of major tech companies and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on the horizon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report its quarterly results, which could be influenced by the overall performance of tech stocks and the market's reaction to recent AI-related developments. The news mentions that several Big Tech names, including Apple, are set to publish quarterly results, which could impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged could also affect market dynamics. Given that Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are higher and that several tech giants, including Nvidia, have seen positive movements following sharp declines earlier in the week, it seems that investor sentiment may be improving.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, as well as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The recent sell-off in tech stocks, triggered by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, has led to a rebound in some tech stocks, including Nvidia. However, there are still concerns about the impact of DeepSeek's model on the tech industry's AI spending. Apple's earnings report, scheduled for Thursday, will likely be closely watched by investors. Given the mixed signals and the potential for volatility, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, due to the company's strong track record and the potential for a positive earnings report.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticking up. While there are still concerns about the implications of the new Chinese AI model from DeepSeek, there has been a recovery in tech stocks, particularly driven by Nvidia's significant gains. Apple's positioning as part of the 'Magnificent 7' and the anticipation surrounding its quarterly results contribute positively to its outlook. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates, which should reduce market pressures. However, uncertainty remains regarding Apple's earnings and potential AI spending implications, which slightly counterbalances the positive sentiment. Taking all factors into account, there is a slightly higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The previous round of predictions reveal a general leaning towards a neutral-to-positive outlook for AAPL, with probabilities of price rise ranging from 0.45 to 0.65. The consistent mention of the 'Magnificent 7' and the significance of AAPL's upcoming earnings report reinforces the importance of this news. The recovery of tech stocks from the DeepSeek AI concerns, alongside a potentially stable interest rate environment, provides a somewhat supportive backdrop. However, concerns about AI spending impact and looming disappointing LVMH sales provide cautions. Given the cluster towards the middle of previous predictions and slightly erring towards the positive based on overall market sentiment and Apple being part of 'Magnificent 7', I adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly increased optimism, while acknowledging that the earnings report is really the key catalyst.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the overall upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, suggesting positive market sentiment, and ASML's strong performance, indicating robust demand in the semiconductor sector.  However, countervailing factors exist. LVMH's disappointing sales growth raises concerns about demand for premium goods, and the impact of the DeepSeek AI model on tech spending remains uncertain, potentially affecting Apple's earnings report. The Fed's expected rate hold is largely neutral, though Powell's comments could influence market sentiment.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.45 to 0.65 for the probability of a price rise, and the mixed nature of the news, a balanced probability is warranted, slightly weighted towards a rise given the overall market trends and Apple's position within the 'Magnificent 7'.  The uncertainty around the earnings report is the biggest factor; while positive market sentiment and ASML's success are promising, the potential for negative surprises related to AI spending remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the overall upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P futures, suggesting a rebound in tech stocks following earlier declines. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant event, and the company's strong position as part of the 'Magnificent 7' could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's expected decision to maintain interest rates may provide market stability. However, concerns about AI spending following the emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model and mixed performance from peers like LVMH introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors and the slightly positive sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The overall sentiment in the market appears cautiously optimistic around major tech earnings, particularly with the Nasdaq and S&P futures rising. Despite concerns about AI spending sparked by the DeepSeek AI model, Apple's strong position as part of the 'Magnificent 7' and the recovering tech sector sentiment contribute to a positive outlook. The Federal Reserve's expected decision to maintain interest rates provides stability, but Powell's commentary could introduce some uncertainty. Considering the positive market sentiment, tech sector recovery, and Apple's earnings report anticipation, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector including upcoming earnings reports from major tech firms, a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and the mixed performance of peers like ASML and LVMH. Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Given the mix of positive and negative indicators and considering others' predictions, a cautious optimistic stance is recommended.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The overall sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) appears cautiously optimistic ahead of its earnings report, supported by rising Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures. This positive trajectory is buoyed by a rebound in tech stocks, particularly after significant gains by Nvidia post sell-off. However, uncertainties remain due to concerns over AI spending prompted by the DeepSeek model and disappointing sales from LVMH, which may signal weaker demand for premium products. Despite this mixed backdrop, AAPL's strong association with the so-called 'Magnificent 7' and the Federal Reserve's likely decision to maintain interest rates foster a positive outlook. Thus, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.41, Reasoning: The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, considering the upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P futures and the recovery in tech stocks. The anticipation surrounding Apple's earnings as part of the 'Magnificent 7' and the expected maintenance of interest rates by the Federal Reserve supports this view. ASML's strong performance also adds to the optimism. However, concerns remain regarding the impact of AI spending and the mixed performance of peers such as LVMH, which introduces some uncertainty. Considering previous predictions fluctuate around slightly above neutral outlook, these factors are considered, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to remain slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the overall upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P futures, suggesting positive market sentiment, and ASML's strong performance, indicating robust demand in the semiconductor sector.  This is further bolstered by the recovery in tech stocks from the DeepSeek AI model scare.  However, countervailing factors exist. LVMH's disappointing sales growth raises concerns about demand for premium goods, and the impact of the DeepSeek AI model on tech spending remains uncertain, potentially affecting Apple's earnings report. The Fed's expected rate hold is largely neutral, though Powell's comments could influence market sentiment. The previous predictions show a wide range (0.45 to 0.65) reflecting the uncertainty.  Given the mixed signals and the significant weight of Apple's upcoming earnings report, I'm assigning probabilities slightly weighted towards a rise, reflecting the generally positive market sentiment and Apple's position within the 'Magnificent 7'. However, the significant uncertainty around the earnings report and the potential for negative surprises related to AI spending needs to be acknowledged.  The consensus leans slightly positive but overall uncertainty remains high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include the overall upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, indicating a rebound in tech stocks after earlier declines driven by concerns over a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant event, and its strong position as part of the 'Magnificent 7' tech firms could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's expected decision to maintain interest rates may provide market stability. However, concerns about AI spending following the emergence of DeepSeek's model and mixed performance from peers like ASML (positive) and LVMH (negative) introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors and the slightly positive sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Given the mix of positive and negative indicators and considering others' predictions, a cautious optimistic stance is recommended.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The overall sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) is cautiously optimistic, supported by rising Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures and a rebound in tech stocks following previous declines. Apple's positioning as part of the 'Magnificent 7' adds to the positive outlook, particularly ahead of its earnings report. While concerns regarding AI spending from the new Chinese model and disappointing luxury goods sales (as indicated by LVMH) introduce some uncertainty, the anticipated Federal Reserve decision to maintain interest rates is expected to provide stability. Balancing these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than that of it falling due to the positive market reaction to tech earnings expectations overall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The sentiment surrounding Apple's stock ahead of its earnings remains cautiously optimistic. The upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, coupled with the rebound in tech stocks, provides a positive backdrop. Apple's significance as part of the 'Magnificent 7' further bolsters confidence. While concerns about AI spending due to DeepSeek's model and LVMH's disappointing sales add uncertainty, the anticipated stable interest rates from the Federal Reserve offer support. The preceding predictions largely lean towards a cautiously optimistic stance, clustering between 0.55 and 0.65. Considering these factors, I will adjust to the center of that range and estimate that Apple will see little price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include the overall upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P futures, suggesting positive market sentiment, and ASML's strong performance, indicating robust demand in the semiconductor sector.  This is further bolstered by the recovery in tech stocks from the DeepSeek AI model scare.  However, countervailing factors exist.

However, the significant uncertainty around the earnings report and the potential for negative surprises related to AI spending needs to be acknowledged. The consensus leans slightly positive but overall uncertainty remains high.  I've also considered the trend of previous predictions, which show a slight upward bias in the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key positive factors include the upward trend in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, indicating a broader tech sector rebound after earlier declines driven by concerns over the DeepSeek AI model. Apple's strong position as part of the 'Magnificent 7' and the anticipation of its earnings report contribute to positive sentiment. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's expected decision to maintain interest rates provides stability.
