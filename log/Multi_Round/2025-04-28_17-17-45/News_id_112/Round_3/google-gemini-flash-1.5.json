(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is part of the earnings preview for a significant time period, but it highlights concerns regarding recent struggles of Apple's stock price and bearish sentiments, particularly focused on potential guidance cuts. Despite stable December quarter estimates, the ongoing headwinds from China and a general downbeat outlook weigh heavily. Although some analysts see potential for a rebound based on manageable issues with China and upcoming AI partnerships, overall sentiment appears more bearish given the context of Apple's recent performance compared to peers in the Magnificent 7. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than that of a rise, as the market may react negatively due to the existing concerns about Apple's future guidance and earnings expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since hitting a 52-week high due to China worries and AI strategy concerns, there's also optimism. Analysts anticipate stable EPS estimates for the December quarter and a potential announcement of a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. Current fiscal year EPS estimates are slightly down. Overall, the negative sentiment seems priced in, countered by a local AI partnership to possibly fuel growth. Weighing the negative pressure of recent performance and potential for a guidance cut by bearish analysts alongside the potential positive catalyst of the local AI partnership announcement, there are nearly equal competing predictions for share price rise or decline. The news also focuses on TSLA, META, and MSFT, however, for AAPL, the China AI strategy and earnings will influence the price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece highlights mixed sentiment surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings report.  While the overall market earnings picture is positive, Apple specifically is facing headwinds related to concerns about China and its AI strategy.  The article mentions a potential guidance cut, declining EPS estimates, and lagging performance compared to other \"Magnificent 7\" companies. Conversely, the article notes that some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to a potential partnership with a Chinese AI company as a positive catalyst.  The uncertainty surrounding these conflicting viewpoints makes predicting a definite price movement difficult.  However, the weight of the negative sentiment (guidance cut concerns, lagging performance, China worries) slightly outweighs the potential positives (overdone negativity, potential AI partnership). Therefore, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges Apple is currently facing, including persistent worries about China and its AI strategy, as well as a lagging stock performance compared to other 'Mag 7' members. Estimates for Apple's fiscal year 2025 EPS have been under pressure, indicating downward revisions. However, Apple bulls argue that the negative sentiment may be overdone, expecting the company to manage China headwinds and potentially announce a local AI partner. Despite this optimism, the immediate concerns and downward revisions in earnings estimates likely weigh more heavily on investor sentiment in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions that Apple shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock has lost about 15% of its value since hitting a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Some bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner in the next few months, which could potentially boost the stock price. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 for Apple is $7.40, which has been declining. Given this mixed outlook, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher due to potential undervaluation and expected positive developments, but there's still significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Q4 earnings reports for several major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article notes that Apple's stock has struggled lately, with a 15% decline since its 52-week high around Christmas, due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. However, some analysts believe that the negative sentiment is overdone and that Apple may announce a local AI partner soon, which could positively impact the stock price. Given this mixed outlook, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, due to the prevailing concerns and the potential for a guidance cut.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining expectations for future earnings and faces concerns over China and its AI strategy. On the other hand, Apple bulls perceive the current negative sentiment as overblown. The positive reaction to similar news for Tesla could serve as a contrast, highlighting divergent market reactions based on perceived resilience or growth potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. Despite the struggles of the stock, with a 15% decline since its recent high and ongoing concerns regarding China and AI strategy, there is also optimism among some analysts about potentially oversold sentiment and expectations for a local AI partnership announcement. Ultimately, while the potential for growth exists, the prevailing bearish sentiment and pressure on earnings estimates lead to a slightly higher probability of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. There's negative sentiment due to recent underperformance, concerns about China and their AI strategy, and potential guidance cuts. This is counterbalanced by the possibility of a local AI partnership announcement and the opinion that the negative sentiment might be overdone by some analysts. Looking at the previous predictions, there is a trend of higher probability of stock price falling. Given that this trend continues this round and integrating the new information, it's likely that the negative aspects will outweigh the potential positives in the short term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease. The information may be already priced in, and this may lead to the situation where it does not deviate too much from the original price. Therefore, overall I would expect the stock price to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While concerns remain regarding China, AI strategy, and potential guidance cuts,  the possibility of a local AI partnership announcement offers a potential upside.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning slightly towards a price fall, but no clear consensus.  The fact that EPS estimates have been declining is a negative factor. However, the significant drop since the 52-week high might already reflect some of the negative sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the previously diverse model predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the potential for a positive surprise with the AI partnership announcement but weighing it against other existing concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, Apple's stock has underperformed recently, losing 15% of its value since its 52-week high due to persistent concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. On the positive side, Apple bulls argue that the negative sentiment is overdone and expect the company to manage China headwinds and potentially announce a local AI partner, which could serve as a positive catalyst. Given the prevailing concerns and downward revisions in earnings estimates, the immediate sentiment appears more bearish, but the potential for positive developments introduces uncertainty. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and highlights mixed sentiments towards the company. Apple's stock has struggled lately, declining by 15% since its 52-week high due to concerns about China and its AI strategy. Some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner soon, which could positively impact the stock price. However, bearish analysts are projecting a potential guidance cut, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising seems slightly lower than the probability of it falling, but the difference is not substantial.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with concerns about China and its AI strategy weighing on the stock, but also potential positive developments such as a local AI partnership announcement. However, the overall sentiment from previous predictions suggests a leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the prevailing concerns and potential for a guidance cut. Given the mixed signals and the weight of negative factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than that of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with concerns about recent performance lagging behind peers, AI strategy worries, and potential guidance cuts. However, there is also potential for a local AI partner announcement, which could be seen as a positive catalyst. While the negative aspects weigh heavily, as evidenced by the recent stock price decline and bearish analyst projections, the possibility of positive developments remains. Considering the previous predictions, there seems to be a consensus that the negative factors are likely more impactful in the short term.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report. Apple's stock has recently declined by 15% due to concerns about its performance in China and its AI strategy, alongside bearish predictions of a potential guidance cut. Although some analysts believe that the negative sentiment may be overdone and see the potential for an announcement regarding a local AI partnership, the prevailing concerns about declining earnings estimates and underperformance compared to peers indicate a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. The previous predictions leaned toward a bearish outlook, leading to a more conservative estimate of the stock's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The overall sentiment toward Apple remains mixed but leans slightly negative. Concerns about China, AI strategy, and potential guidance cuts persist. The possibility of an AI partnership is a potential upside, yet the declining EPS estimates and recent stock underperformance raise concerns. Reviewing previous predictions, there is a slight consensus towards a higher probability of the stock price decreasing. Given these mixed signals and the trend from previous predictions, the negative pressure outweighs the potential positive catalyst of an AI partnership in the near term. I assign a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While there are significant concerns regarding China, its AI strategy, and the potential for a guidance cut, leading to a 15% decline since the 52-week high, there's also countervailing optimism.  Some analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to a potential AI partnership announcement as a positive catalyst.  The previous predictions show a trend toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but there isn't a strong consensus.  The downward revision in earnings estimates is a negative factor. However, the significant recent price drop might already reflect some of this negative news.  Balancing the negative factors (weak performance, China concerns, potential guidance cut) against the potential positive surprise of a new AI partnership, and considering the previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall in the short-term, although the probabilities are relatively close.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with both negative and positive factors influencing the stock price. On the negative side, Apple's stock has underperformed recently, losing 15% of its value since its 52-week high due to persistent concerns about China and its AI strategy. Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. On the positive side, Apple bulls argue that the negative sentiment is overdone and expect the company to manage China headwinds and potentially announce a local AI partner, which could serve as a positive catalyst. Considering the prevailing concerns and downward revisions in earnings estimates, the immediate sentiment appears more bearish, but the potential for positive developments introduces uncertainty. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

(AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown declining expectations for future earnings and faces concerns over China and its AI strategy, as highlighted in recent struggles with its stock price. There are bearish projections of guidance cuts and downward earnings estimates, reflecting ongoing market worries. However, on the positive side, there is optimism among bulls who believe the negative sentiment might be overdone and that Apple may announce a local AI partnership, which could positively impact the stock. The recent negative trends combined with bearish analyst projections suggest a higher probability of stock price falling. Nonetheless, the potential for a positive catalyst such as an AI partnership slightly increases the probability of a price rise, but not enough to significantly shift the overall sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
