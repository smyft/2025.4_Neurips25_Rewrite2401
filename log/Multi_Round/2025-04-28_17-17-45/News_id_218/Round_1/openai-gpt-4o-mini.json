(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jefferies Cuts Apple Rating, Flags iPhone Weakness and Slower AI Growth\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares continue to decline following a Jefferies downgrade to Underperform from Hold, driven by concerns about slowing iPhone demand and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also cut its price target to $200.75 from $211.84.\n\nJefferies analysts, led by Edison Lee, predict Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target of 5% and guide for minimal growth in Q2, falling below consensus estimates. Slower AI adoption and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for future iPhones add to the concern.\n\nNew data from IDC shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, while subsidies in China are expected to exclude most iPhone models due to pricing limits, potentially dampening demand. Meanwhile, Apple's budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives, limiting its potential.\n\nAs of 11:07 AM ET, Apple shares traded at $221.25, down 3.80%, reflecting growing investor worries. Earlier in premarket trading, shares were already down 2%. Apple is set to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on January 30, with expectations closely watched amid these challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies to Underperform and the cut in price target reflect serious concerns about Apple's iPhone demand and slower growth in AI, which are both critical drivers of revenue for the company. The reported decline in iPhone shipments and the challenges for the new iPhone SE4 further add to negative sentiment. Given these factors and the immediate reaction to the news with a 3.80% decline, there is a higher probability of the stock price continuing to fall. The upcoming earnings report is likely a critical point but the sentiment surrounding the news is currently unfavorable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, lowered its price target, and cited multiple headwinds: slowing iPhone demand (backed by IDC data), potential exclusion from Chinese subsidies, concerns about AI adoption, and competition for the iPhone SE4. The stock is already down significantly. While earnings are upcoming, the analyst predictions suggest a potential negative surprise, further increasing downward pressure. The only slightly positive factor is the earnings report itself. If Apple can beat predictions then the stock may be able to find some strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies, a reputable firm, downgraded Apple's rating and lowered its price target, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, slower AI adoption, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The IDC data supporting a decline in iPhone shipments further strengthens the bearish sentiment.  Although the current price already reflects some of the negative news (down 3.8%), the potential for further downside is significant given the concerns about future performance and the upcoming earnings report, which may confirm or worsen the current outlook. The probability of a price rise is low because the negative factors outweigh any potential positives. The pre-market drop and the ongoing sell-off indicate significant investor concern.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies to Underperform, concerns about slowing iPhone demand, reduced price target, slower AI adoption, delays in advanced packaging for future iPhones, and declining iPhone shipments. Additionally, competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives is expected to limit the potential of the budget iPhone SE4. The stock price has already declined by 3.80% as of 11:07 AM ET, reflecting investor worries. Given the negative sentiment and fundamental concerns, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected AI growth, and downgraded ratings from Jefferies. The firm's price target was cut to $200.75 from $211.84, and predictions include missed revenue growth targets and minimal growth in Q2. Additionally, iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, and potential competition and pricing issues may further dampen demand. Given these factors, the news is predominantly negative, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's rating by Jefferies due to concerns about slowing iPhone demand and slower AI growth. The firm cut its price target and predicts Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target. Additionally, new data shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, and the budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition. These factors contribute to a negative outlook for Apple's stock price. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of the stock price falling is high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies has downgraded Apple's rating and lowered its price target due to concerns over iPhone sales and slower AI growth. Multiple factors, including declining iPhone shipment numbers, competitive pressures, and lower-than-expected revenue forecasts, have caused share prices to drop significantly. These negative signals suggest the market might continue reacting negatively to the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
