(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) is maintaining its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices despite a broader trend of companies retracting from such initiatives in response to conservative pressures. This stance could positively influence investor sentiment and align with values held by socially conscious investors, potentially leading to a stability or increase in stock price. However, there exists a risk that ongoing political and legal scrutiny around DEI policies could create volatility. Given these mixed factors, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise and a relatively low chance of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to increased scrutiny of DEI programs, especially in light of a new Trump administration. While several companies are scaling back DEI efforts, both Costco and Apple are explicitly defending their DEI stances. The key element impacting Apple is that they are facing their own upcoming shareholder vote on a similar DEI proposal, mirroring the Costco situation. Costco's overwhelming victory (98%) suggests strong institutional investor support for DEI, which bodes well for Apple's upcoming vote. This implicit comparison with a positive outcome is likely to be interpreted favorably by the market. However, the article also highlights the broader political climate, with increasing pressure from Republican-controlled states potentially creating future risk. Given these conflicting factors, the probability of a rise slightly outweighs a fall, as the immediate market reaction is likely to be a mild positive due to the favorable Costco precedent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a shift among some companies to scale back these programs.  Apple's steadfast stance, similar to that of Costco and some major banks, suggests resilience against potential negative impacts from the changing political landscape and recent Supreme Court rulings. While the article mentions potential legal challenges facing some companies involved in DEI, Apple's own situation is not presented with the same level of immediate threat.  The upcoming shareholder vote on Apple's DEI practices is a risk, but the article suggests Apple is confident in its position.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price increase is slightly higher than a decrease.  The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be relatively small compared to other significant factors influencing the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) standing firm on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite increasing scrutiny and opposition from conservative groups and political figures. The article highlights that Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) to assess risks of its DEI programs. This stance aligns with other major companies like Costco, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs, which are also defending their DEI efforts. The article suggests that some investors and stakeholders view DEI positively, as evidenced by the overwhelming support for Costco's position (98% of investors). However, there is also political and legal opposition, which could create uncertainty. Apple's strong brand and historically progressive stance may mitigate negative reactions, but the polarized nature of DEI debates could lead to mixed market reactions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in companies, particularly in the context of the new Trump era. While many companies are backing away from DEI policies, Costco successfully defended its DEI stance against a shareholder resolution. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is also mentioned as having asked investors to vote down a similar shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). The article suggests that Apple's commitment to DEI might be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a stock price increase. However, the overall market impact is uncertain, and the stock price movement may be influenced by various factors, including investor sentiment and broader market trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies that are defending their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite pressure from conservative groups and the current US administration. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies that has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal encouraging the company to assess risks of its DEI programs. This suggests that Apple is committed to its DEI stance, which could be viewed positively by investors who value diversity and inclusion. However, the overall sentiment of the article is neutral, and the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Given that Apple is standing firm on its DEI policies, which could be seen as a positive move by socially responsible investors, and considering the lack of any significantly negative news about the company in the article, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's commitment to DEI in the face of political pressure aligns with a growing preference among socially conscious investors. The positive outcome for Costco's recent shareholder vote on DEI efforts indicates potential institutional support for similar initiatives at Apple. While there is some concern regarding political and legal scrutiny, Apple's historical brand strength and commitment to diversity can promote investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price increase is estimated to be higher than that of a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI, as highlighted in the news, presents a mixed bag of potential market reactions. On one hand, it resonates positively with socially conscious investors, mirroring Costco's successful defense against a similar shareholder proposal. This alignment with a progressive stance could attract investment and bolster the stock price. On the other hand, escalating scrutiny towards DEI initiatives from conservative political circles and potential legal challenges could inject volatility into the stock. Considering the previous round's consensus hovering around a slight inclination towards a rise, driven by Apple's proactive defense and the Costco precedent, along with similar viewpoints, I will maintain a cautious optimism, slightly adjusting to account for persistent political headwinds. The consistent but slightly divergent prior predictions suggest no major unseen information. Therefore, I am adjusting my prediction slightly upward from the general trend observed in the previous round, as Apple is moving forward in comparison to other companies moving backwards, and it can be viewed as a positive signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed picture. While Apple's continued commitment to DEI might resonate positively with some investors, the broader context of increasing political and legal pressure against such initiatives introduces considerable uncertainty.  The Costco example, while positive for Apple's upcoming shareholder vote, doesn't guarantee a similar outcome.  The 98% vote in favor of Costco's DEI policies is encouraging, but this could be unique to Costco and not necessarily representative of the sentiment toward Apple's future vote. The overall impact depends significantly on how the market interprets Apple's stance alongside the broader political climate and the outcome of its upcoming shareholder vote.  Considering the previous predictions, which range between a 50/50 chance to a 65/35 split in favor of a price rise, and the inherent uncertainty of this particular news, a slightly conservative estimate is warranted.  A slight positive bias toward a rise is justified by the Costco precedent and Apple's established brand, but the risks remain significant enough to not assume a substantially higher probability of a price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) firm stance on maintaining its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, despite increasing political and legal scrutiny. This commitment aligns with socially conscious investors and could be viewed positively, as evidenced by Costco's recent overwhelming shareholder support (98%) for similar DEI policies. However, the broader political climate and potential legal challenges introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and historical progressive stance, the immediate market reaction is likely to be mildly positive, but the polarized nature of DEI debates could lead to mixed reactions. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise slightly outweighs the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite increasing scrutiny and opposition from conservative groups and political figures. Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) to assess risks of its DEI programs. This stance aligns with other major companies like Costco, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs, which are also defending their DEI efforts. The positive outcome for Costco (98% of investors supporting its DEI stance) suggests a favorable precedent for Apple. However, ongoing political and legal scrutiny around DEI policies could create volatility. Given these mixed factors, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise and a relatively low chance of decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite increasing scrutiny and opposition from conservative groups and political figures.

Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices. The previous predictions show a moderate probability of stock price rising, driven by the belief that Apple's commitment to DEI aligns with the interests of value-driven investors. There is a concern about political and legal pressures, but the immediate market reaction appears moderately positive.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's commitment to maintaining its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, particularly in light of the positive outcome for Costco, is likely to resonate well with socially conscious investors. Despite rising political scrutiny on DEI initiatives, Apple's robust brand reputation and historical commitment to progressive values may provide a stabilizing influence on investor sentiment. The upcoming shareholder vote poses some uncertainty, but Costco's overwhelming support for DEI suggests potential institutional backing for Apple as well. Overall, the consensus is leaning towards a moderate probability of stock price rise, as the broader market moves toward valuing companies with strong ethical positions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: Apple's unwavering commitment to DEI amidst growing political pressure presents a complex scenario. The successful defense of DEI by Costco against a similar shareholder proposal is a positive indicator, suggesting institutional investor support for such initiatives. This could attract socially conscious investors and enhance Apple's brand image. However, increasing scrutiny from conservative groups and potential legal challenges introduce risks. The previous predictions consistently favor a slight rise, suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook. Considering Apple's brand strength, historical commitment to diversity, and the Costco precedent, a rise in stock price seems more probable, but the political and legal risks temper this optimism. The trends in previous models suggest that the overall sentiment remains in the positive, and there has not been significant factors influencing the stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price.  While Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI aligns with the values of some investors and mirrors Costco's successful defense of its DEI program (98% shareholder support), the broader political and legal climate presents significant headwinds. The increasing scrutiny of DEI initiatives from conservative groups and potential legal challenges could negatively impact investor sentiment.  The upcoming shareholder vote on Apple's DEI programs introduces further uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a consensus leaning slightly towards a price increase (around 0.55-0.62 probability), primarily driven by the Costco precedent and Apple's brand strength.  However, the persistent risk of negative political and legal repercussions necessitates a more cautious outlook.  While the Costco outcome is encouraging, it is not a guarantee of a similar outcome for Apple. Considering these conflicting factors, a moderate probability of a rise slightly outweighs a fall, but the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be relatively small compared to other market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s firm stance on maintaining its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, despite increasing political and legal scrutiny. This commitment aligns with socially conscious investors and could be viewed positively, as evidenced by Costco's recent overwhelming shareholder support (98%) for similar DEI policies. However, the broader political climate and potential legal challenges introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and historical progressive stance, the immediate market reaction is likely to be mildly positive, but the polarized nature of DEI debates could lead to mixed reactions. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise slightly outweighs the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.41, Reasoning: Apple Inc.

The overall sentiment among the models suggests that Apple's commitment to DEI could be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a stock price increase, but the risks and uncertainties introduced by the political climate and potential legal challenges cannot be ignored.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) commitment to maintaining its DEI programs amidst a broader trend of companies retracting from such initiatives. Positive precedents set by companies like Costco demonstrate strong institutional support for DEI policies. While there is increasing scrutiny and potential legal challenges, Apple's strong brand, alignment with socially conscious investors, and a series of prior predictions indicating a slight positive outlook all contribute to a modest probability of stock price rise.
