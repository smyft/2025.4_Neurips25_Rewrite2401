However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of Apple. On the other hand, the potential ban of TikTok, a competitor in the digital services space, could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. Nonetheless, the impact of both news items is likely to be minimal and short-term. Considering the overall positive outlook for Apple's core businesses and the relatively minor nature of these news items, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is expected to be relatively balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or positive outcome.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"TikTok ban upheld, Apple's AI news, Intel: Market Minute\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
