A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban could create uncertainty in the technology and social media sectors, which may indirectly affect Apple as a major tech player. However, since Apple is primarily focused on its products and services rather than social media, this news may have minimal negative impact on its stock price. The pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual inaccuracies could also raise concerns about its AI initiatives but may not significantly influence investor sentiment. Overall, while there are some negative aspects in the headlines, the broader market sentiment may remain stable, leading to a balanced probability. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong brand and market position despite these concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed. The pausing of AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative development, potentially reflecting poorly on their AI initiatives and overall quality control. This could lead to a slight dip in investor confidence, especially as AI is a hot topic. The TikTok situation, while potentially beneficial in the long run as less competition for attention on iOS devices, is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock. The Intel news is unrelated and unlikely to directly affect Apple. Considering these factors, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple focuses on the pausing of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This is likely to have a relatively minor negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  The issue is specific to a relatively small and new feature, and doesn't affect Apple's core business or overall financial strength. The TikTok ban, while potentially impacting the overall market sentiment, is unlikely to directly and significantly influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the overall impact of this news on AAPL is likely to be muted.  We expect a modest potential for a price decrease, but the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three key points: the TikTok ban upheld, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This could be seen as a negative development, potentially harming Apple's reputation in AI and news credibility, which might lead to a slight negative sentiment among investors. However, the impact is likely limited as this is a specific issue and not a fundamental problem with Apple's core business. The TikTok ban upheld is not directly related to Apple, so its impact is negligible. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three main points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple's AI news summaries paused due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is that its AI-generated news summaries have been paused due to complaints about factual errors. This could potentially harm Apple's reputation in the AI space, but it might not have a significant immediate impact on its stock price as the company's core business is not heavily dependent on this specific AI application. However, any negative publicity around AI capabilities could affect investor sentiment. The TikTok ban and Intel's potential acquisition are not directly related to Apple's core business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors may have a slight negative impact on the stock price. However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of Apple. On the other hand, the potential ban of TikTok, a competitor in the digital services space, could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. Nonetheless, the impact of both news items is likely to be minimal and short-term. Considering the overall positive outlook for Apple's core businesses and the relatively minor nature of these news items, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is expected to be relatively balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or positive outcome.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban being upheld introduces a level of uncertainty in the technology sector that could influence Apple indirectly, but since Apple is focused on hardware and services rather than social media, the impact may be limited. The pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual inaccuracies is more concerning, potentially impacting investor confidence in their AI initiatives. Yet, given that this issue is isolated and doesn't affect Apple\u2019s core business significantly, the overall sentiment may lean towards stability. Moreover, confidence in Apple's brand and fundamentals remains strong. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher likelihood of a stock price rise as long-term fundamentals remain intact, despite the mixed signals from this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a slightly negative impact, primarily due to the AI news summarization issue. While the TikTok ban is generally viewed as neutral to slightly positive, and the Intel news is irrelevant, the AI issue creates a temporary negative sentiment. Considering the varying predictions, I am slightly increasing the probability of a price rise, acknowledging that the impact of the AI summarization issue may be short-lived and not materially impactful to the company's core business. However, I'm still weighing the negative context from other AI failures, which typically penalizes the stock's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed. The pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative but minor development.  It reflects poorly on their AI initiatives and quality control, but this is a relatively small part of Apple's overall business. The TikTok ban is largely unrelated and its impact on Apple is likely minimal, though indirectly there could be a slight positive effect from reduced competition for user attention.  Previous predictions are quite varied, ranging from 40% to 55% probability of a price fall, and 40% to 55% probability of a price rise. This wide range suggests uncertainty in the market reaction.  Considering the minor negative impact of the AI news and the largely irrelevant TikTok news, I lean toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but the overall impact is expected to be limited. The lack of significant positive news combined with the minor negative overshadows the very small potential for positive indirect impact from TikTok.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) primarily focuses on the pause of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This could negatively impact investor sentiment regarding Apple's AI initiatives, but the effect is likely limited as this is not a core business issue. The TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court is not directly related to Apple and is unlikely to have a significant impact. Given the mixed nature of the news and the minor relevance to Apple's core operations, the stock price movement is expected to be relatively neutral with a slight bias towards a negative reaction due to the AI news. Previous predictions also indicate a slight leaning towards a negative impact, though not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors may have a slight negative impact on the stock price. However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of Apple. The TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court is not directly related to Apple's core business, and its impact is likely to be minimal. Considering the overall positive outlook for Apple's core businesses and the relatively minor nature of these news items, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is expected to be relatively balanced. However, given that the AI-generated news summaries pause is a negative development, albeit minor, and the TikTok ban could potentially benefit Apple by reducing a competitor's influence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong brand and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) includes the pause of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, which could have a slight negative impact on the stock price. However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of Apple. The potential ban of TikTok, a competitor in the digital services space, could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, but the impact is likely to be minimal. Considering the overall positive outlook for Apple's core businesses and the relatively minor nature of these news items, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is expected to be relatively balanced. Analyzing previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price falling due to the negative news about the AI-generated news summaries. However, Apple's strong brand and market position could mitigate this effect. Therefore, I estimate a probability of the stock price rising slightly lower than 0.5 and a probability of the stock price falling slightly higher than 0.5.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple points affecting different tech companies. For Apple (AAPL), the most relevant news is the temporary pause of AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This could slightly affect investor confidence in Apple's AI initiatives, though it doesn't directly impact core business operations. The TikTok ban is not directly relevant to Apple but could signal broader regulatory challenges. Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target is unrelated news for Apple. Given historical trends and the relative minor impact of these points, the probabilities seem moderately negative but remain within a fairly balanced range.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news about Apple Inc. includes the TikTok ban being upheld and Apple's pause of AI-generated news summaries due to factual inaccuracies. The TikTok ban may create slight positive sentiment for Apple by reducing competition for user attention, but this impact is likely minimal. The pause in AI news summaries is more significant, reflecting negatively on Apple's AI initiatives and potentially hurting investor confidence. However, this issue does not affect Apple's core business, suggesting that the overall impact could be limited. Given the mixed nature of the news and earlier predictions, I estimate a higher probability of price falling slightly outweighs the probability of price rising, due to the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's AI news and lack of compelling positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from previous predictions leans slightly negative towards Apple due to the pause in AI-generated news summaries. This issue raises concerns about Apple's AI initiatives, but it isn't a core business function. The TikTok ban presents a mixed, indirectly positive impact. Considering the stable brand reputation of Apple, and the slightly negative AI summarization news, the probability of stock price decreasing is still a little bit higher than that of increasing.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed. The pause in AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative development, but it's relatively minor and isolated, unlikely to significantly impact Apple's overall performance.  The TikTok ban is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a stock price fall, primarily due to the AI news. However, Apple's robust fundamentals and strong brand image likely mitigate the negative impact.  The consensus leans slightly negative, but the magnitude of the potential price movement is expected to be small.  Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the negative AI-related news while acknowledging the limited impact and Apple's overall strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) primarily focuses on the pause of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, which could negatively impact investor sentiment regarding Apple's AI initiatives, albeit minimally since this is not a core business issue. The TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court is not directly related to Apple and is unlikely to have a significant impact. Given the minor negative news about AI and the overall strong position of Apple in the market, the stock price movement is expected to be relatively neutral with a slight bias towards a negative reaction. Previous predictions also indicate a slight leaning towards a negative impact, though not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc.

Given these points and considering Apple's strong brand and market position, the overall impact of the news seems slightly negative but not overwhelmingly so.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The recent news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. The upheld TikTok ban could indirectly benefit Apple's market position, as it may reduce competition for user attention. However, the pause of Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual inaccuracies raises concerns about the company's capabilities in AI, potentially affecting investor confidence. This negative sentiment is considered more significant than the indirect potential positive effect from the TikTok situation. Overall, while Apple's core business remains strong, the negative sentiment from the AI news seems to outweigh any potential positives. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price falling slightly more than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The continued negative sentiment surrounding Apple's paused AI-generated news summaries is the primary driver of my prediction. While the TikTok ban is indirectly beneficial, its impact is minimal and overshadowed by the AI misstep. Previous rounds consistently show a slight bias towards a stock price decrease, reflecting concerns, albeit limited, about Apple's AI initiatives impacting investor confidence. Given this established trend and the lack of significant positive counter-news, I'm maintaining a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news is mixed. The pause of Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative, but likely minor, event.  It reflects poorly on their AI initiatives but doesn't affect core business. The TikTok ban is largely irrelevant to Apple, though it might offer indirect, minor benefit by reducing competition for iOS user attention. The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall (around 55%), primarily due to the AI news. However, Apple's strong brand and market position may mitigate this negative impact.  Considering the relatively minor nature of the negative news and the lack of significant positive news, I'm aligning my prediction with the overall trend of previous models, while acknowledging the resilient position of Apple.  Therefore, a small negative bias is expected.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. includes the pause of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors, which could negatively impact investor sentiment regarding Apple's AI initiatives, but the effect is likely limited as this is not a core business issue.
