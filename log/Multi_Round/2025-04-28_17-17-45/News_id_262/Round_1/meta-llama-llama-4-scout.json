A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about the TikTok ban could create uncertainty in the technology and social media sectors, which may indirectly affect Apple as a major tech player. However, since Apple is primarily focused on its products and services rather than social media, this news may have minimal negative impact on its stock price. The pause in Apple's AI-generated news summaries due to factual inaccuracies could also raise concerns about its AI initiatives but may not significantly influence investor sentiment. Overall, while there are some negative aspects in the headlines, the broader market sentiment may remain stable, leading to a balanced probability. Hence, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong brand and market position despite these concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed. The pausing of AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors is a negative development, potentially reflecting poorly on their AI initiatives and overall quality control. This could lead to a slight dip in investor confidence, especially as AI is a hot topic. The TikTok situation, while potentially beneficial in the long run as less competition for attention on iOS devices, is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock. The Intel news is unrelated and unlikely to directly affect Apple. Considering these factors, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple focuses on the pausing of its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This is likely to have a relatively minor negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  The issue is specific to a relatively small and new feature, and doesn't affect Apple's core business or overall financial strength. The TikTok ban, while potentially impacting the overall market sentiment, is unlikely to directly and significantly influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the overall impact of this news on AAPL is likely to be muted.  We expect a modest potential for a price decrease, but the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three key points: the TikTok ban upheld, Apple pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple (AAPL), the relevant news is the pause in its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors. This could be seen as a negative development, potentially harming Apple's reputation in AI and news credibility, which might lead to a slight negative sentiment among investors. However, the impact is likely limited as this is a specific issue and not a fundamental problem with Apple's core business. The TikTok ban upheld is not directly related to Apple, so its impact is negligible. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions three main points: the TikTok ban upheld by the Supreme Court, Apple's AI news summaries paused due to factual errors, and Intel being cited as a potential acquisition target. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant news is that its AI-generated news summaries have been paused due to complaints about factual errors. This could potentially harm Apple's reputation in the AI space, but it might not have a significant immediate impact on its stock price as the company's core business is not heavily dependent on this specific AI application. However, any negative publicity around AI capabilities could affect investor sentiment. The TikTok ban and Intel's potential acquisition are not directly related to Apple's core business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) pausing its AI-generated news summaries due to factual errors may have a slight negative impact on the stock price. However, this news is not significantly material to the overall financial performance of Apple. On the other hand, the potential ban of TikTok, a competitor in the digital services space, could have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. Nonetheless, the impact of both news items is likely to be minimal and short-term. Considering the overall positive outlook for Apple's core businesses and the relatively minor nature of these news items, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is expected to be relatively balanced, with a slight leaning towards a neutral or positive outcome.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
