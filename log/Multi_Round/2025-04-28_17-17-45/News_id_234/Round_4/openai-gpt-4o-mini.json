      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok restoring service in the U.S. after recent concerns may not have a significant direct impact on Apple Inc.'s stock price. However, the overall context suggests a stabilization of the social media landscape, which can positively affect app ecosystems on iOS devices. Given that Apple generates substantial revenue from the App Store and user engagement on their devices, any resolution regarding TikTok could have a mild positive effect. Despite this, there are no direct implications for Apple's operations or market performance in the immediate future, leading to middling probabilities for stock movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news is slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While it doesn't directly involve Apple's core business, the avoidance of a TikTok ban in the US removes a small headwind for the overall tech sector and consumer spending. A ban would have created uncertainty and potentially impacted ad revenues across various platforms, including those where Apple benefits. Furthermore, the resolution suggests a more stable regulatory environment under the new administration than initially feared, promoting investor optimism across the large-cap tech space. However, the impact on Apple is diffused because it's not directly competing with or heavily reliant on TikTok's operations. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is only moderately increased, while a price decline remains possible due to overall market conditions or other company-specific news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple is not directly involved in this situation.  While some might argue that a potential negative impact on TikTok could indirectly affect Apple (e.g., reduced app store revenue), the headline focuses on a short-term disruption that's been resolved. Given the limited connection between the news and Apple's core business and financial performance, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction due to this news is extremely low.  Any movement is likely to be noise within the overall market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary resolution to the TikTok ban issue, which had previously caused uncertainty for companies like Apple that rely on app store revenues. Apple (AAPL) benefits from the presence of TikTok on its App Store, as it drives user engagement and potential in-app purchases. With TikTok's service being restored and the possibility of a long-term solution, this reduces regulatory risk and may positively impact Apple's stock. However, the impact is likely moderate since this is a broader industry issue rather than a direct financial catalyst for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news revolves around TikTok, a social media app, and its regulatory issues in the United States. Apple's stock price movement is not directly influenced by TikTok's operational status or its negotiations with the U.S. government. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. However, since the news does not inherently suggest a positive impact on Apple, it's reasonable to assume a slight inclination towards a neutral or negative impact due to overall market sentiment or indirect effects, if any.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after President Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. However, considering the overall positive tone of the news, with a major social media app being allowed to continue operating, this could be perceived as a positive development for the tech industry as a whole. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, might see some indirect benefit from this perception, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Given that there's no direct link between Apple and TikTok's situation, the probabilities of the stock price movement should be closer to 50%, but with a slight edge towards a rise due to general positive industry sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok restoring its service after recent shutdowns suggests a stabilization in the social media landscape. While TikTok is not directly related to Apple's core business, there is a potential indirect benefit, as TikTok's presence on the App Store enhances user engagement and could lead to increased in-app purchases. Additionally, the absence of a TikTok ban alleviates regulatory uncertainty, which is beneficial for the broader tech sector, including Apple. However, since the impact is indirect and moderately positive, I believe the probabilities should reflect a slight edge towards a rise in Apple's stock price while acknowledging the possibility of a decline due to broader market fluctuations. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.58 for the stock price rising and 0.42 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. following Trump's announcement is a moderately positive development for the tech industry. While Apple doesn't directly participate in TikTok's operations, the resolution of regulatory uncertainty surrounding a major social media platform can improve overall sentiment towards tech companies. This reduced uncertainty could lead to a slightly more positive investor outlook for Apple. Several models have predicted a moderately high probability of the price rising. Given this, I'll adjust my prediction slightly towards a higher up, and lower down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's reinstatement is largely irrelevant to Apple's core business. While Apple benefits from a thriving app ecosystem, the impact of TikTok's brief shutdown and subsequent restoration is likely minimal and indirect.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct connection.  Most models acknowledge a slight possibility of a positive effect due to general market sentiment or a slightly more stable regulatory environment, but the effect is likely to be small and easily overshadowed by other market factors.  The possibility of a negative impact is equally low. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards neutrality, slightly favoring a neutral to slightly positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration in the U.S. does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by this news, as it pertains to TikTok's regulatory issues rather than Apple's core business operations. However, the resolution of TikTok's situation could be seen as a positive development for the broader tech industry, which might indirectly benefit Apple. Given the lack of a direct connection, the probabilities of a stock price movement in either direction are relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a rise due to general positive sentiment in the tech sector.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the resolution of the TikTok ban issue could be seen as a positive development for the tech industry, potentially leading to a stable regulatory environment. This stability might indirectly benefit Apple by maintaining a healthy app ecosystem on its devices. Given the lack of direct connection between Apple's operations and TikTok's situation, the probabilities of the stock price movement should be closer to 50%. However, considering the overall positive tone and the potential for a stable tech environment, there is a slight edge towards a positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after President Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. However, considering the overall positive tone of the news, with a major social media app being allowed to continue operating, this could be perceived as a positive development for the tech industry as a whole. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, might see some indirect benefit from this perception, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Given that there's no direct link between Apple and TikTok's situation, the probabilities of the stock price movement should be closer to 50%, but with a slight edge towards a rise due to general positive industry sentiment. Analyzing the predictions from other models, the range of predictions suggests that the news has a mildly positive to neutral impact on Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a slightly higher probability of a rise and others predicting a higher probability of a fall or no significant movement. Taking these predictions into consideration, a balanced approach would slightly favor a rise in stock price due to the positive industry sentiment, but acknowledge the uncertainty and potential for no significant movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news regarding TikTok's restoration after a brief shutdown has a marginal impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While TikTok's continued operation benefits the broader tech ecosystem as it sustains engagement on both its platform and associated app stores, this news is not directly linked to Apple's core business activities or immediate financial metrics. Given the diverse factors influencing AAPL's stock price, including its own product cycles, market competition, and overall macroeconomic conditions, the news may contribute to a minor positive sentiment. However, this positive sentiment is overshadowed by the lack of any direct and material impact on Apple's financials or operations.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. after a brief shutdown suggests a stabilization in the social media landscape. Although TikTok is not directly related to Apple's core business, the reinstatement is a relief for the tech industry, reducing regulatory uncertainty. This positive sentiment could impact Apple indirectly, as a stable app ecosystem on the App Store may encourage user engagement and spending. Given the overall positive trend in predictions from various models, I estimate a modest probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising, while acknowledging the possibility of market fluctuations that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service after a short shutdown continues to be viewed as having a slightly positive but indirect impact on Apple (AAPL). The consensus from previous rounds indicates this event alleviates some regulatory uncertainty within the tech sector, potentially creating a more stable environment that could benefit companies like Apple. However, the effect is not substantial since Apple isn't directly involved in TikTok's operations, and it mainly relies on a healthy app ecosystem. Given the slight edge towards positive sentiment by most predictors in the prior rounds, it's appropriate to give a probability skewed modestly towards a rise in Apple's stock price, while still accounting for broader market fluctuations and company-specific events. I adjust the predictions in round 1 to reflect this ongoing view. The Qwen prediction in the last round significantly reduces the probability of both rising and falling (rise=0.3, fall=0.35). This is more negative than other predictions. The prediction in this round needs to pull the probabilities a bit more conservative to incorporate the slightly more negative view from Qwen in the last round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's reinstatement after a brief shutdown has a very weak, indirect relationship with Apple's stock price.  While a healthy app ecosystem benefits Apple, TikTok's temporary disruption and subsequent return is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's financials. The lack of direct connection between Apple's core business and TikTok's operational status makes the news largely irrelevant for short-term stock price movement. Analysis of previous model predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, mostly clustering around 0.5 probability for either stock movement.  This reinforces the view that the news item is not a major driver for Apple's stock.  While a generally positive sentiment towards the resolution of TikTok\u2019s situation could create a slightly positive bias, this is not enough to significantly alter the probabilities of price movement, which remain close to neutral. The collective opinion among the previous predictions places the probability of either rise or fall near 50%. Therefore, I will adhere to a more neutral assessment given the lack of substantial impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's restoration after a brief shutdown is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations. However, the resolution of TikTok's regulatory issues may have an indirect positive effect on the tech sector by reducing uncertainty and maintaining a stable app ecosystem, which benefits Apple via the App Store. Given the lack of a direct connection, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be mild but slightly positive, as reflected in the majority of previous predictions. The probabilities are adjusted to reflect a modestly favorable outlook due to broader industry sentiment, while acknowledging other factors could dominate Apple's stock movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the resolution of the TikTok ban issue could be seen as a positive development for the tech industry, potentially leading to a stable regulatory environment. This stability might indirectly benefit Apple by maintaining a healthy app ecosystem on its devices. Given the lack of direct connection between Apple's operations and TikTok's situation, the probabilities of the stock price movement should be closer to 50%. However, considering the overall positive tone and the potential for a stable tech environment, there is a slight edge towards a positive impact. Analyzing the predictions from other models, the range of predictions suggests that the news has a mildly positive to neutral impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after President Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc.

Analyzing the predictions from other models, the range of predictions suggests that the news has a mildly positive to neutral impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news regarding TikTok's restoration after a brief shutdown has a marginal impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). While TikTok's continued operation benefits the broader tech ecosystem as it sustains engagement on both its platform and associated app stores, this news is not directly linked to Apple's core business activities or immediate financial metrics. Given the diverse factors influencing AAPL's stock price, including its own product cycles, market competition, and overall macroeconomic conditions, the news may contribute to a minor positive sentiment. However, this positive sentiment is overshadowed by the lack of any direct and material impact on Apple's financials or operations.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service in the U.S. suggests a stabilization in the social media landscape, which indirectly benefits Apple Inc. as it maintains a healthy app ecosystem on iOS devices, enhancing user engagement and potential revenue from the App Store. While the impact is not direct, the overall positive sentiment surrounding this resolution reduces regulatory concerns within the tech sector, which can benefit Apple. Most previous predictions show a slight inclination towards a positive impact on Apple's stock price, reflecting an optimistic market sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability of the stock price rising while acknowledging the possibility of fluctuations that could lead to a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's restoration of service after a short shutdown continues to be viewed as having a slightly positive indirect impact on Apple (AAPL). The consensus from previous rounds and models continues to indicate the decision alleviates some regulatory uncertainty within the tech sector, potentially creating a more stable environment, and benefiting companies like Apple. However, the effects are still relatively minor, considering the absence of any direct involvement by Apple in TikTok's operations, yet the benefit from a healthy app ecosystem remains relevant. The models tend to reach equilibrium around 0.5 indicating a neutral impact but generally show a slight nudge towards positive sentiment. Thus, I will follow the consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's reinstatement after a brief shutdown has a very weak, indirect relationship with Apple's stock price.  The majority of the AI models predict a very slight probability of a positive impact, primarily due to reduced uncertainty in the tech sector and a generally positive market sentiment following the resolution of the situation. However, the connection is tenuous.  Apple's financial performance is not directly tied to TikTok's operational status.  The predictions from the previous rounds show a wide range of probabilities, underscoring the limited direct impact.  Several models have slightly revised their predictions over rounds, reflecting a moderate tendency towards a slightly higher probability of a price increase, but the increase remains modest, near 50%. While a more stable regulatory environment could be seen as slightly beneficial to the broader tech sector, including Apple, it would be dwarfed by other factors influencing Apple's stock price, such as product launches, overall market trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, after analyzing the previous models' predictions and assessing the very indirect influence of the news, I predict probabilities close to neutral, with a slight upward bias.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's restoration after a brief shutdown is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations.
