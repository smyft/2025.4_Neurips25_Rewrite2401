(AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

However, the overall context suggests a stabilization of the social media landscape, which can positively affect app ecosystems on iOS devices. Given that Apple generates substantial revenue from the App Store and user engagement on their devices, any resolution regarding TikTok could have a mild positive effect. Despite this, there are no direct implications for Apple's operations or market performance in the immediate future, leading to middling probabilities for stock movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news is slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While it doesn't directly involve Apple's core business, the avoidance of a TikTok ban in the US removes a small headwind for the overall tech sector and consumer spending. A ban would have created uncertainty and potentially impacted ad revenues across various platforms, including those where Apple benefits. Furthermore, the resolution suggests a more stable regulatory environment under the new administration than initially feared, promoting investor optimism across the large-cap tech space. However, the impact on Apple is diffused because it's not directly competing with or heavily reliant on TikTok's operations. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is only moderately increased, while a price decline remains possible due to overall market conditions or other company-specific news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple is not directly involved in this situation.  While some might argue that a potential negative impact on TikTok could indirectly affect Apple (e.g., reduced app store revenue), the headline focuses on a short-term disruption that's been resolved. Given the limited connection between the news and Apple's core business and financial performance, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction due to this news is extremely low.  Any movement is likely to be noise within the overall market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary resolution to the TikTok ban issue, which had previously caused uncertainty for companies like Apple that rely on app store revenues. Apple (AAPL) benefits from the presence of TikTok on its App Store, as it drives user engagement and potential in-app purchases. With TikTok's service being restored and the possibility of a long-term solution, this reduces regulatory risk and may positively impact Apple's stock. However, the impact is likely moderate since this is a broader industry issue rather than a direct financial catalyst for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news revolves around TikTok, a social media app, and its regulatory issues in the United States. Apple's stock price movement is not directly influenced by TikTok's operational status or its negotiations with the U.S. government. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. However, since the news does not inherently suggest a positive impact on Apple, it's reasonable to assume a slight inclination towards a neutral or negative impact due to overall market sentiment or indirect effects, if any.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after President Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. However, considering the overall positive tone of the news, with a major social media app being allowed to continue operating, this could be perceived as a positive development for the tech industry as a whole. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, might see some indirect benefit from this perception, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. Given that there's no direct link between Apple and TikTok's situation, the probabilities of the stock price movement should be closer to 50%, but with a slight edge towards a rise due to general positive industry sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
