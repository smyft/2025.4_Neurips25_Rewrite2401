      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The announcement of Apple beginning to utilize semiconductors produced at TSMC's Arizona facility could positively impact the company's stock price. This move signifies an effort toward semiconductor independence and the strengthening of a domestic supply chain amidst global competition, which is favorable for Apple's long-term strategy. The successful production in Arizona could enhance operational efficiency and potentially reduce geopolitical risks related to reliance on Taiwan. Thus, the probability of a stock price rise is higher. The logistical challenges mentioned could introduce slight uncertainty, but they are not significant enough to overshadow the overall positive outlook from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple due to the start of semiconductor supply from TSMC's Arizona fab. This diversifies Apple's supply chain, reducing reliance on Taiwan which is subject to geopolitical risks. This is a strategic move aligning with the broader trend of reshoring critical manufacturing in the US and may be viewed favorably as mitigating risk, improving supply chain security, and potentially garnering political favor or subsidies. Although there were logistical challenges mentioned and shipping to Amkor in Taiwan initially, these hurdles are framed with an acknowledgement of the overall tide of reshoring of critical manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. The news of the Arizona plant opening is a long way off (Q1 2025), thus the news may have a small immediate effect. The fact that AMD and NVDA are testing production there as well, signals the viability of the facility, not competition for Apple. Thus, the overall impression is a slight positive, though it's impact may be relatively small given the timing and some minor headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news that Apple will begin using semiconductors manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is generally positive for Apple.  This reduces Apple's reliance on Taiwan for chip production, mitigating geopolitical and natural disaster risks.  While the news doesn't represent an immediate impact on Apple's financials,  it signifies a long-term strategic advantage, enhancing supply chain resilience and potentially lowering costs in the future. However, the initial production is still subject to testing and potential setbacks, and the fact that packaging is still being done in Taiwan introduces a degree of uncertainty.  Therefore, while the overall sentiment is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant and immediate surge in the stock price.  The market may already have partly priced in this development. A slight increase in price is more probable than a drastic one.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it highlights progress toward semiconductor independence and supply chain resilience by sourcing chips from TSMC's Arizona fab. This reduces reliance on Taiwan, mitigating geopolitical and natural disaster risks. The move aligns with broader U.S. efforts to reshore critical manufacturing, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the actual impact on AAPL's stock will depend on broader market conditions and the successful execution of the Arizona fab's production without delays or quality issues. Given the positive sentiment around supply chain diversification and reduced risks, the stock is more likely to rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple's plan to use chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab, set to launch in Q1 2025, is generally positive for Apple Inc. (AAPL). This development signifies a strategic move towards diversifying and securing Apple's supply chain, reducing reliance on Taiwanese production and mitigating risks associated with geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. By localizing chip production in the United States, Apple can potentially benefit from reduced latency in the supply chain, improved security, and possibly favorable regulatory treatment. While there might be short-term costs associated with this transition, the long-term benefits of supply chain resilience and reduced risk could outweigh these. Therefore, the news is likely to be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a positive development for the company, as it reduces reliance on Taiwan and mitigates geopolitical risks.
