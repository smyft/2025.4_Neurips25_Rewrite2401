(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's insights on Apple Inc.'s position within the AI market and consumer demand. Cramer highlights concerns about Apple's lack of consumer interest in AI products and the struggles with the iPhone in China. While he expresses some belief in the long-term potential of AI, he emphasizes that the current consumer sentiment is not encouraging. Given this context, coupled with the expectation of upcoming earnings misses and estimate cuts that may already be priced in, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges the potential struggles of the iPhone in China and concerns about consumer AI initiatives, he also argues that these are already priced into the consensus estimates. He suggests that potential earnings disappointments will not be a surprise due to widespread expectations. While Cramer expresses belief in AI, his skepticism regarding the AI PC super-cycle and consumer adoption could negatively impact sentiment around Apple's future growth. Overall, the article presents slightly more negative or neutral signals than positive especially with Apple's dependence on technology improvement and super-cycles as a company model. Therefore, the assessment is that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that for the stock price rising due to the content of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments on Apple are mixed. While he acknowledges the potential of AI and uses ChatGPT himself, he expresses skepticism about the consumer market for AI PCs and suggests that the market is already anticipating a lower-than-expected earnings report.  His statement that the consensus estimates are already factored into the stock price implies that a potential negative surprise would have less of an impact than previously anticipated.  The article itself downplays Apple's AI prospects compared to other companies.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly cause a major price swing either way.  A slight downside risk exists due to the expressed concerns about consumer AI adoption and the expectation of an earnings miss, although the impact of the earnings miss is deemed to be reduced due to already tempered expectations.\n\nThe article's focus on other AI stocks as more promising and the neutral to slightly negative tone regarding Apple's prospects suggest that this news is slightly bearish, but not significantly so. The 158 hedge fund holders indicate significant institutional investment already priced into the stock.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns around Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its consumer AI initiatives and iPhone performance in China. Jim Cramer's comments suggest skepticism about the AI PC super-cycle and consumer demand for AI products, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the mention of potential earnings estimate cuts and lack of surprise in misses adds to the bearish outlook. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio might mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the news leans more negative than positive for AAPL's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and his views on AI PCs and consumer demand. Cramer expresses skepticism about an AI hardware super cycle, citing a Morgan Stanley survey that shows lackluster consumer interest in AI PCs. However, he remains positive about AI's potential in enterprise use cases. Cramer also emphasizes that the consensus estimates for Apple might be too low, suggesting that any potential disappointment in earnings might not be as severe as expected. Overall, the news does not provide strongly positive or negative signals about Apple's stock performance but highlights concerns about consumer AI demand and the importance of consensus estimates.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle. Cramer believes that there is no evidence of a super cycle in AI-enabled products, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, he also praises the potential of AI in enterprise use cases and mentions that he uses ChatGPT daily. Additionally, Cramer notes that the consensus estimates for Apple's earnings may not matter as much as people think, which could reduce the impact of a potential earnings miss. Overall, the article presents mixed opinions on Apple's stock, but the negative comments on the AI hardware super cycle and consumer demand for AI PCs may have a slightly greater impact on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its emphasis on AI and hardware innovation. Additionally, the news mentions Wall Street's skepticism towards Apple's consumer AI initiatives and struggles in the Chinese market, suggesting potential negative sentiments about future earnings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses concerns around Apple's AI consumer initiatives and struggles with the iPhone in China. Jim Cramer's comments highlight skepticism about the AI hardware super cycle and consumer demand, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. While he acknowledges enterprise AI's potential, the consensus estimates appear to factor in expected earnings misses, suggesting that significant negative surprises may be less impactful. Overall, the tone of the news leans slightly bearish, with more analysts predicting a fall in stock price than a rise, indicating a higher probability of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While acknowledging Cramer's concerns about consumer AI initiatives and iPhone struggles in China, he also downplays the impact of potential earnings misses due to already tempered expectations. The article also highlights that other AI stocks are more promising, which could divert investor interest away from Apple. Considering the previous rounds consistently predict a higher probability of the stock price falling, it's prudent to follow that trend, albeit with a slight adjustment to account for the 'priced-in' expectations. Consequently, a 60% probability of falling seems appropriate compared to the others' highest of 70%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Cramer acknowledges potential headwinds like weak consumer interest in AI PCs and iPhone struggles in China, he also suggests that these factors are largely already priced into the stock.  His belief that the consensus estimates are low reduces the potential impact of a negative earnings surprise.  However, the overall tone regarding Apple's AI prospects is less enthusiastic than for other AI companies, creating a slightly negative sentiment. The previous predictions show a range from 0.3 to 0.45 probability of a price rise and 0.55 to 0.7 probability of a price fall. Considering this range and the mixed signals in the news, a slightly pessimistic outlook is warranted, but a significant drop is unlikely given already tempered expectations.  Therefore, I am leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced view of Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a focus on AI-related concerns. Jim Cramer's comments highlight skepticism about the AI PC super-cycle and consumer demand for AI products, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Additionally, the article mentions Wall Street's doubts about Apple's consumer AI initiatives and struggles in the Chinese market, suggesting potential headwinds for future earnings. While Cramer remains positive about enterprise AI applications like ChatGPT, his mixed tone and the overall negative sentiment around consumer AI adoption skew the outlook slightly bearish for AAPL's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's insights on Apple Inc.'s position within the AI market and consumer demand. Cramer highlights concerns about Apple's lack of consumer interest in AI products and the struggles with the iPhone in China. While he expresses some belief in the long-term potential of AI, he emphasizes that the current consumer sentiment is not encouraging. Given this context, coupled with the expectation of upcoming earnings misses and estimate cuts that may already be priced in, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. The mixed sentiments from various models also lean slightly towards a bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with Jim Cramer expressing skepticism about consumer demand for AI PCs and the potential struggles of the iPhone in China. However, he also emphasizes the potential of AI in enterprise use cases and notes that the consensus estimates for Apple's earnings may already factor in potential disappointments. Given the mixed signals and the fact that Cramer's concerns about AI PCs and consumer demand are countered by his belief in AI's potential and the already tempered expectations for Apple's earnings, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than that of rising. However, considering the diversified product portfolio and strong brand of Apple, the difference in probabilities is not significantly large.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its emphasis on AI and hardware innovation. Additionally, the news mentions Wall Street's skepticism towards Apple's consumer AI initiatives and struggles in the Chinese market, suggesting potential negative sentiments about future earnings. The consensus estimates are already factored into the stock price, implying that further negative news might have less of an impact.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's insights indicate skepticism regarding consumer demand for AI PCs and highlight challenges with the iPhone's performance in China. While he acknowledges the long-term potential of AI, the current consumer sentiment is discouraging, suggesting a lack of enthusiasm in the market. Given that Wall Street has tempered expectations for upcoming earnings, the probability of a stock price fall seems higher based on the mixed to negative tone of the news and the perspectives of previous analyses. Consequently, the predicted probabilities reflect a consensus leaning towards a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.37, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.63, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple. Jim Cramer's concerns regarding consumer AI adoption, particularly AI PCs, and Apple's struggles in the Chinese market, are significant headwinds. While he acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise and uses ChatGPT, his overall sentiment towards consumer-facing AI and Apple's prospects isn't overwhelmingly positive. The consensus estimates might already factor in some negative expectations, potentially mitigating a severe drop. However, the consistently bearish sentiment from the previous rounds and the lack of strong positive catalysts suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the slightly negative tone of the news, a slight adjustment towards more pessimistic sentiment is justified. Therefore, I am setting the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While concerns exist regarding consumer AI adoption and iPhone performance in China, Jim Cramer suggests these factors are largely priced into the current stock value.  His belief that consensus estimates are low minimizes the potential impact of a negative earnings surprise. However, the relatively lukewarm assessment of Apple's AI prospects compared to other companies and the overall negative sentiment surrounding consumer AI adoption create a slightly bearish undertone.  Analyzing the previous predictions, a consistent trend emerges:  a higher probability of a price fall is predicted across multiple models.  While the 'priced-in' expectation mitigates the potential for a sharp decline, the persistent negative sentiment, coupled with the overall mixed news, points towards a higher likelihood of a price fall than a rise. The consensus among the previous models ranges from 0.3 to 0.45 for a price rise and 0.55 to 0.7 for a price fall. Considering this, a probability weighting slightly towards a price fall is justified.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer expressing skepticism about the AI PC super-cycle and consumer demand for AI products, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, he also acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise use cases and suggests that consensus estimates may already factor in potential earnings misses, reducing the impact of negative surprises. The article highlights Wall Street's concerns about Apple's consumer AI initiatives and struggles in the Chinese market, which could weigh on the stock. While Cramer's positive remarks about AI applications like ChatGPT provide some balance, the overall tone leans slightly bearish. Considering the previous predictions and the mixed signals in the news, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of rising, though not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.36, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.64, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's insights on Apple Inc.'s position within the AI market and consumer demand. Cramer highlights concerns about Apple's lack of consumer interest in AI products and the struggles with the iPhone in China. While he expresses some belief in the long-term potential of AI, he emphasizes that the current consumer sentiment is not encouraging. Given this context, coupled with the expectation of upcoming earnings misses and estimate cuts that may already be priced in, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. The mixed sentiments from various models also lean slightly towards a bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the AI hardware super cycle, highlighting skepticism about consumer demand for AI PCs and struggles with the iPhone in China. While Cramer acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise use cases, his overall view on AI PCs is negative, which could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy. Considering the mixed signals from various models and the fact that Cramer's concerns are countered by his belief in AI's potential and already tempered expectations for Apple's earnings, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than that of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding AI-related products and services. Jim Cramer acknowledges the importance of enterprise AI but expresses concerns over consumer demand for AI PCs. While he continues to be positive about AI applications like ChatGPT, his overall view on AI PCs is negative. This could impact investor confidence in Apple's strategy, particularly its emphasis on AI and hardware innovation. Additionally, the news mentions Wall Street's skepticism towards Apple's consumer AI initiatives and struggles in the Chinese market, suggesting potential negative sentiments about future earnings. The consensus estimates are already factored into the stock price, implying that further negative news might have less of an impact.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. reflects a mixed but predominantly negative outlook. Cramer expresses concerns over consumer interest in AI PCs and the performance of the iPhone in China, aligning with Wall Street's skepticism towards Apple's consumer AI initiatives. Although he acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise applications, the lack of current consumer enthusiasm and the anticipation of earnings misses suggest higher risks. The consensus estimates may currently reflect these concerns, potentially mitigating some impacts, yet the overall sentiment leans bearish. Predictions from various models trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, underscoring investor worries about Apple's future growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.36, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.64, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally negative outlook for Apple. Jim Cramer's skepticism about consumer AI adoption and the struggles of the iPhone in China remain key concerns. Although some believe these factors are already priced in, the prevailing sentiment across multiple analysis models leans towards a bearish perspective. While Cramer acknowledges the potential of AI in enterprise applications like ChatGPT, this is insufficient to outweigh the negative outlook in the short term. Previous rounds of predictions consistently favor a higher probability of stock price decline, suggesting a persistent negative sentiment around Apple's immediate prospects. Given this prevailing trend, my analysis aligns with a higher probability that the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Cramer's skepticism regarding the consumer AI market and iPhone struggles in China are significant concerns, his belief that negative earnings surprises are already priced in mitigates the potential for a sharp decline.  The consistent bearish sentiment from previous prediction rounds, the lack of strong positive catalysts, and the overall lukewarm assessment of Apple's AI prospects compared to other companies suggest a higher probability of a price fall than a rise. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified portfolio provide some cushion against extreme negative reactions. Considering the previous predictions' range (0.3 to 0.45 for a price rise and 0.55 to 0.7 for a price fall) and the mixed signals, a probability weighted slightly toward a price fall is justified, but not drastically so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer expressing skepticism about the AI PC super-cycle and consumer demand for AI products, which could negatively impact investor sentiment.
