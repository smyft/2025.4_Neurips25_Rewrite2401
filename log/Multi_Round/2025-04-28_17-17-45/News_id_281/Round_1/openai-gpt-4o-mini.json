(AAPL)\nNews Headline: China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\nNews Content: Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei. I hope 2025 has been kind to you so far.I am writing this week\u2019s newsletter having just finished\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this Financial Times article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The announcement of China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips suggests significant advancements in technology for Apple. This could enhance their supply chain efficiency and potentially increase profit margins, leading to a positive reaction in the stock market. However, concerns around competition from Chinese tech companies could weigh on stock sentiment. Given these factors, it's reasonable to estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price rise due to innovation while acknowledging competitive risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two potentially conflicting factors. 'China's memory breakthrough' could negatively impact Apple as it might increase competition or reduce component costs, potentially lowering Apple's revenue if not managed correctly. 'Apple's first US chips' on the other hand, is generally positive, indicating a move towards domestic production and potentially reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, improving supply chain resilience and potentially creating US jobs (good PR). Furthermore, lacking specifics about the China breakthrough or the significance of US chips, it is difficult to precisely quantify this news impact on Apple's stock price . Also, the article is locked behind a paywall, making a concrete assessment challenging. Given the limited information and conflicting signals, a conservative approach is best. The headline is very suggestive and requires the full article for complete analysis, due to the uncertainty, I am placing a larger emphasis on a no change or less pronounced movement in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The provided news headline is incomplete and lacks crucial details.  Without access to the full Financial Times article, a precise prediction of Apple's stock price movement is impossible. The headline mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, both of which could have positive or negative implications for Apple depending on the specifics.  China's memory breakthrough could be a threat if it leads to cheaper alternatives to Apple's components or an opportunity if it opens new manufacturing or market possibilities.  Apple's first US chips might reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing, potentially viewed positively by investors, or might prove more expensive, negatively impacting profitability.  In the absence of concrete details, it is reasonable to assume a neutral stance with a slightly higher probability of a neutral or positive outcome due to the potential for reduced reliance on foreign manufacturing. This estimation is heavily qualified by the lack of information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline suggests two key points: China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips. However, the full content is behind a paywall, limiting detailed analysis. Generally, China's advancements in memory technology could pose competitive pressures on Apple's supply chain or component costs, potentially negatively impacting margins. On the other hand, Apple's first US chips might indicate a strategic shift towards domestic production, which could be viewed positively by investors due to potential supply chain resilience or government incentives. Given the lack of detailed information, the probabilities are estimated with moderate uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news mentions China's memory breakthrough and Apple's first US chips, which could have implications for Apple's supply chain and manufacturing processes. This breakthrough could potentially reduce Apple's dependence on external suppliers, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings. Additionally, the development of US-based chips could have positive implications for Apple's relationships with US lawmakers and regulators. However, without more specific information about the details of the breakthrough and its potential impact on Apple's operations, the overall effect on the stock price is uncertain. Given the general positive tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news mentions a potential breakthrough in memory technology in China and the development of Apple's first US-made chips. The breakthrough in memory technology could potentially affect the supply chain and cost structure of Apple, which might have a negative impact on stock performance. However, the development of US-made chips could be seen positively as it promotes domestic manufacturing and technological independence, which can increase investor confidence. Considering both aspects, there could be a slight positive impact on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The former could imply increased competition or reduced component costs for Apple, which poses a risk to their margins. Conversely, the latter indicates a strategic move towards domestic production that may enhance supply chain resilience and garner favorable public sentiment. After considering the mixed implications of both developments, the overall outlook leans slightly positive due to the potentially advantageous impact of Apple's US chips, despite the competitive pressure from China's advancements.
