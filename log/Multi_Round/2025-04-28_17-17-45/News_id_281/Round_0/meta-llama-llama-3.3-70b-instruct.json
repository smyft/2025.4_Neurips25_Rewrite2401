This breakthrough could potentially reduce Apple's dependence on external suppliers, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings. Additionally, the development of US-based chips could have positive implications for Apple's relationships with US lawmakers and regulators. However, without more specific information about the details of the breakthrough and its potential impact on Apple's operations, the overall effect on the stock price is uncertain.
