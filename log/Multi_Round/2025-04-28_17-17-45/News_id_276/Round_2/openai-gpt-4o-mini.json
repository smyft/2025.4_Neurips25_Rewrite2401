(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Canalys: Apple Slips in China--Vivo and Huawei Take Lead Amid iPhone Sales Slump\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slips fractionally in premarket trading after losing its top spot in China's smartphone market in 2024. Local brands Vivo and Huawei move ahead as Apple's shipments drop 17% to 42.9 million units, bringing its market share down to 15%, according to Canalys.\n\nVivo takes the lead with 49.3 million units shipped, gaining 17% market share after an 11% increase in sales. Huawei follows closely, shipping 46 million units, a 37% surge from 2023, regaining ground despite U.S. restrictions limiting its chip supply. China's smartphone market rebounds, shipping 285 million units in 2024, growing 4% year-over-year after two years of declines. Analysts point to affordable premium designs, in-house chips, and foldable phone innovations as key drivers.\n\nOppo and Honor complete the top five smartphone makers in China.Moreover, Apple's struggles come amid increased competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems. The shift highlights China's growing preference for homegrown technology over foreign brands.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its leading position in the Chinese smartphone market, with significant declines in shipments and market share. The rise of local competitors like Vivo and Huawei suggests a strong shift in consumer preference towards homegrown brands, especially as these companies innovate with affordable premium designs and advanced AI features. Given these negative market dynamics, it is likely that investor sentiment may turn bearish, leading to an increased probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant negative development for Apple: losing market share in China, a crucial market, to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. A 17% drop in shipments is substantial and suggests weakening demand for Apple products in China. The rise of Huawei, despite US restrictions, is also concerning, indicating strong competitive pressure. The article mentions growing preference for homegrown technology, which is a long-term threat for Apple. While the overall China smartphone market is rebounding, Apple is not benefiting proportionally, suggesting underlying issues with their positioning in that market. This adverse shift in the Chinese market and the increase in competition are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a stock price decrease seems high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, a significant market.  While the overall China smartphone market is growing, Apple's 17% drop in shipments and loss of market leadership to Vivo and Huawei are negative indicators.  The resurgence of Huawei, despite chip supply limitations, highlights the competitive pressure Apple faces.  While the news is negative for Apple's China market performance, it's crucial to consider that this is only one region. Apple's overall global performance and its robust product ecosystem are likely to mitigate the impact of this single market's downturn. The pre-market fractional slip suggests the market is already partially factoring in this news. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is relatively low, but the probability of a price increase is even lower given the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its top spot in China's smartphone market, with a significant 17% drop in shipments, leading to a reduced market share of 15%. This decline is attributed to increased competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei, which have gained traction due to advanced AI features, affordable premium designs, and innovations like foldable phones. Given that China is a critical market for Apple, this negative performance is likely to weigh on investor sentiment. The slight premarket dip suggests initial market reaction is negative. Overall, the news is bearish for AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its top spot in China's smartphone market to local brands Vivo and Huawei. Apple's shipments have dropped 17% to 42.9 million units, resulting in a market share of 15%. This decline is attributed to increased competition from local brands offering advanced features and custom operating systems. Given this negative sales performance and increasing competition, it is likely that the stock price will be negatively impacted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top spot in China's smartphone market to local brands Vivo and Huawei, with a significant 17% drop in iPhone shipments. This decline, combined with the growing preference for homegrown technology in China, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and revenue. Additionally, the increase in competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems may further erode Apple's market share. Therefore, the likelihood of the stock price falling due to this news is higher than the likelihood of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in Apple's smartphone market share in China due to increased competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei. This trend is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment as China is a critical market for Apple. The competitive pressures, particularly with local brands offering advanced features and homegrown technology, suggest ongoing challenges that could further affect Apple's market position and growth potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news clearly highlights a significant decline in Apple's sales performance in China, a crucial market for the company. The reported 17% drop in shipments, combined with the loss of market share to local brands like Vivo and Huawei, indicates increasing competitive pressures and a shift in consumer preference towards domestic technology. This deterioration in market positioning is likely to negatively affect investor sentiment and therefore the stock price. Given that prior predictions from various models reflect a strong consensus on the negative impact of this news, it stands to reason that the probabilities for a price drop are considerably high, while the likelihood of a price rise is quite low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is undoubtedly negative for Apple, highlighting a significant market share loss in China, a key market. The decline in shipments (-17%) and the rise of local competitors like Vivo and Huawei (despite Huawei's restrictions) are concerning. Analysts point to specific competitive advantages of local brands (AI, custom OS, foldable phones), suggesting sustained challenges for Apple. Previous models' predictions consistently weighted towards a price decrease. Given that this trend has been repeated in multiple rounds, it is highly likely that market sentiment will decrease for AAPL. I am making adjustments based on others having more negative information about the company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is undeniably negative for Apple, showing a significant 17% drop in iPhone shipments in China and a loss of market leadership.  This is a substantial blow considering China's importance to Apple's global sales. The rise of competitors like Vivo and Huawei, offering competitive pricing and advanced features, further exacerbates the situation.  The consensus from previous models is overwhelmingly bearish, with probabilities of a price drop consistently ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.  While Apple's overall global performance is strong and this is only one regional market, the magnitude of the decline and the competitive pressures make a significant price increase unlikely.  The pre-market dip already suggests some market reaction to the negative news.  However, I've adjusted slightly upward the probability of a price rise compared to the previous models to account for the possibility of a more muted reaction than anticipated due to the fact that Apple's overall global performance and other revenue streams might offset this decline in China.  Investors may already incorporate some of this news into the stock price; therefore the impact may be less severe than initially predicted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in China, a crucial market, with a 17% drop in iPhone shipments and loss of the top spot to local competitors Vivo and Huawei. This negative performance is likely to weigh on investor sentiment, especially given the growing preference for homegrown technology and advanced features offered by local brands. The premarket fractional slip suggests the market is already reacting negatively. While Apple's global performance and ecosystem may mitigate some impact, the news is predominantly bearish for AAPL in the short term. Previous predictions from multiple models also align with a higher probability of a stock price fall, with most models estimating a 70-80% chance of a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost its top spot in China's smartphone market to local brands Vivo and Huawei, with a significant 17% drop in iPhone shipments. This decline, combined with the growing preference for homegrown technology in China, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and revenue. Additionally, the increase in competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems may further erode Apple's market share. The pre-market fractional slip suggests the market is already partially factoring in this news. Considering the negative impact of this news on investor sentiment and the critical role of the Chinese market for Apple, the likelihood of the stock price falling is higher than the likelihood of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost its top spot in China's smartphone market to local brands Vivo and Huawei, with a significant 17% drop in iPhone shipments. This decline, combined with the growing preference for homegrown technology in China, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and revenue. Additionally, the increase in competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems may further erode Apple's market share. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which generally forecast a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the negative market dynamics and competitive pressures, it is likely that the stock price will be negatively impacted. Therefore, the likelihood of the stock price falling due to this news is higher than the likelihood of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a significant decline in Apple's smartphone market share in China due to increased competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei. The shipment drop of 17% further underscores the market dynamics challenging Apple's position in this critical market. Previous predictions from various models indicate a consistent belief that the stock is likely to fall due to this news. While Apple's global presence and brand value might offer a buffer, the news reflects a notable shift in market preference that could negatively influence investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
