A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the advancements in AI and cloud technology, particularly in healthcare, but does not directly relate to Apple Inc. The positive news surrounding AI could lead to increased interest in tech stocks, including Apple, but the specific momentum of AI in healthcare may not directly influence Apple's stock. Additionally, Apple's recent slight decline (0.7%) indicates some existing market pressures. While the overall positive sentiment towards AI might buoy tech stocks, the lack of direct connection and Apple's current performance suggest cautious optimism. Hence, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but also a notable probability of continued decline due to existing market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). While the main focus is on the increasing integration of AI in cloud-based solutions and its impact on the healthcare industry, this is more relevant to companies like PracticeSuite, Google Cloud, and ServiceNow. The article mentions Apple finished down slightly (-0.7%) despite announcing a recent dividend and reporting earnings/revenue growth a day prior. This suggests the immediate impact of the broader cloud AI news on Apple is neutral to slightly negative, primarily due to ServiceNow's lagging performance and the overall AI discussions perhaps overshadowing Apple's individual positive announcements. However, the emphasis on AI overall in stocks such as Super Micro Computer and Alphabet is a positive, implying a generally positive market response to AI stocks. In this case the neutral to negative sentiment is weighed up against the positive sentiment of recent news to indicate a lower chance of a rise and slight fall in price. There is not significant news of Apple embracing AI in order for the company to benefit from the current stock market up turn for AI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the broader AI in cloud computing sector, mentioning several companies' activities related to AI integration in their services.  While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned, it's only in the context of its recent earnings report (increased earnings and revenue, and a cash dividend announcement), and a small daily price drop (-0.7%).  The article itself does not directly link Apple's recent activities to advancements in cloud AI or healthcare AI. The positive movements in other AI-related stocks (e.g., Alphabet) do not directly impact Apple's stock price probability in this specific context. Given the lack of direct positive news regarding Apple and its AI initiatives and its already reported positive earnings, the probability of a stock price rise is considered low, while the probability of a fall is also low, given the already small daily decline and positive recent earnings. The most likely outcome is sideways movement with neutral impact from this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses advancements in AI integration within cloud platforms, particularly in healthcare, but does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of these developments. Apple is briefly noted to have announced a cash dividend and reported increased earnings and revenue, which are typically positive signals for investors. However, the stock closed down 0.7%, possibly due to market reactions or other external factors not detailed in the article. Given the lack of direct impact from the AI and cloud-related news on Apple's core business, the stock price movement is more likely influenced by its recent financial performance and broader market trends rather than the specific AI developments mentioned.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the integration of AI into cloud platforms, highlighting its potential to optimize healthcare workflows. While Apple is mentioned in the article, there is no direct significant news about the company that would significantly impact its stock price. The article primarily focuses on other companies like PracticeSuite, NEC, and ServiceNow. Given the lack of substantial news about Apple, the stock price movement is likely to be minimal or influenced by broader market trends rather than the specific news about AI in healthcare. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on general market conditions and the minor mention of Apple's recent announcement of a cash dividend and increased earnings and revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses advancements in AI and cloud-based solutions in the healthcare sector, which positively impacts companies like PracticeSuite but has a more general effect on the broader market. Apple specifically is highlighted towards the end with a slight dip in stock price due to a cash dividend. Given the positive advancements in AI, there might be some indirect benefits but it seems more neutral for Apple. Since the news does not directly mention any major developments for Apple, other than the previously announced financial metrics, it's inferred the immediate impact will be minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
