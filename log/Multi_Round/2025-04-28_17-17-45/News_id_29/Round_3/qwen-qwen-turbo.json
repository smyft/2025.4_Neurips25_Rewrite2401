(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is facing challenges in AI innovation and has received a downgrade from Oppenheimer, which impacts investor sentiment negatively. Furthermore, the concerns about a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and the potential lag in AI advancements suggest that there will be downward pressure on the stock. Although Apple ranks well among AI stocks, the specific criticisms and the context of competitive pressures make a rise in stock price less likely in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's perceived lack of innovation in AI compared to other companies actively involved in AI development. An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst also points to the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and a lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps.  The Stargate initiative, a large AI project unrelated to Apple's direct operations, is mentioned but has substantial uncertainty regarding funding, potentially impacting investor sentiment around the AI sector in general, but not directly impacting Apple's valuation.  The overall tone leans slightly negative given the specific concerns about Apple's performance and the analyst downgrade. While the news isn't overwhelmingly negative, the lack of significant positive news and the expressed concerns about Apple's AI strategy suggest a greater likelihood of a price decrease in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' with the removal of its $250 price target. The downgrade is based on a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, challenges in the Chinese market, and a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle. Additionally, the article suggests that Apple is struggling to keep up with AI advancements compared to competitors, which could impact its growth prospects. These factors are likely to weigh negatively on investor sentiment, increasing the probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and existing product ecosystem might provide some support, limiting the downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in innovating in AI, citing a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle and little upside to Apple's valuation. This negative analysis and lack of confidence in Apple's AI capabilities are likely to impact the stock price negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles to innovate in AI, with a recent analyst downgrade citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. The analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform due to slower iPhone growth and an uncertain role in the early stages of generative AI adoption among consumers. This negative sentiment suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple related to AI innovation and the company's perceived struggle in this space compared to industry benchmarks. Notable concerns include a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, slower-than-expected growth in iPhone shipments, the absence of significant generative AI offerings, and competitive pressures from other AI-focused companies. The broader context of conflicts involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk and political tensions add to the uncertainties. Given these factors, investor confidence may be negatively impacted, potentially leading to a decline in the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including an analyst downgrade from Oppenheimer, which decreased AAPL's outlook due to a weaker forecast for iPhone sales and concerns about AI innovation. The perception that Apple is lagging behind in generative AI capabilities compared to competitors further diminishes investor confidence. Although Apple is still recognized as a notable AI stock, the overall negative sentiment stemming from the downgrade and sales outlook suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds strongly leans towards a negative outlook for Apple's stock price due to concerns about AI innovation and a recent analyst downgrade. The news article reinforces these concerns. Considering the consistent bearish sentiment across multiple models and the actual content of the news, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect an even stronger expectation of a price decrease, but not as strong as the lowest previous prediction, giving weight to the general trend instead of the extremal value.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple.  An Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales forecasts, a lack of significant AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market, strongly suggests downward pressure on the stock price.  While Apple's inclusion in a list of top AI stocks provides some counterbalance, the analyst's explicit concerns regarding Apple's AI strategy and future growth outweigh this positive factor. The tangential discussion about the Stargate initiative and its funding uncertainties is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in isolation.  The consensus among previous models points toward a higher probability of a stock price decline, which aligns with the overall negative sentiment presented in the news. While the news doesn't guarantee a fall, the weight of negative factors suggests a greater likelihood of a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), focusing on its struggles in AI innovation and a recent analyst downgrade by Oppenheimer. The downgrade cites a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, challenges in the Chinese market, and a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. While Apple's strong brand and ecosystem may provide some support, the lack of positive catalysts and the emphasis on competitive pressures in AI suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. The consensus from previous predictions also leans towards a higher probability of a decline, reinforcing this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' with the removal of its $250 price target.

The analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform due to slower iPhone growth and an uncertain role in the early stages of generative AI adoption among consumers. Considering the negative sentiment from the analyst downgrade, the lack of significant AI innovation, and the competitive pressures from other AI-focused companies, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. The predictions from other models also indicate a similar trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, I conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple related to AI innovation and the company's perceived struggle in this space compared to industry benchmarks. Notable concerns include a downgrade from Oppenheimer due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, slower-than-expected growth in iPhone shipments, the absence of significant generative AI offerings, and competitive pressures from other AI-focused companies. The broader context of conflicts involving high-profile figures like Elon Musk and political tensions add to the uncertainties. Given these factors, investor confidence may be negatively impacted, potentially leading to a decline in the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent news about Apple Inc. highlights significant challenges the company faces, particularly in AI innovation, along with a downgrade from Oppenheimer that cites a weaker outlook for iPhone sales. Analysts are concerned that Apple's efforts in AI are lagging behind competitors, and they expect a slow replacement cycle for iPhones, which contributes to negative investor sentiment. The overall consensus among multiple predictions suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price declining rather than rising, reinforcing the belief that the combination of Macroeconomic pressures, internal challenges, and competitive dynamics directs the sentiment negatively. Thus, I estimate a higher probability for a fall in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment regarding Apple's AI innovation and the Oppenheimer downgrade citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, challenges in AI and China, and slow iPhone replacement cycle continues to dominate the narrative. The lack of positive catalysts and the continued concerns about Apple's AI strategy contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous rounds' predictions all converge on a higher probability of a fall, further solidifying this outlook. Given the increasing confidence in the negative outlook, I will slightly increase the probability of the stock price falling, albeit conservatively, while maintaining a small chance of a rise due to market volatility and potential overreaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  An Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales forecasts and a lack of significant AI innovation compared to competitors, is the primary driver of a negative outlook.  The concerns about Apple's AI strategy and future growth outweigh the fact that it's included in a list of top AI stocks. The discussion about the Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's valuation.  The consensus among previous model predictions consistently points toward a higher probability of a stock price decline, reinforcing this view. While Apple's brand strength and existing ecosystem might offer some resilience, the weight of negative factors suggests a significantly higher likelihood of a price decrease in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a focus on its struggles in AI innovation and a recent analyst downgrade by Oppenheimer. The downgrade cites a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, challenges in the Chinese market, and a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment.

Multiple models consistently predict a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising, citing negative sentiment from the analyst downgrade and competitive pressures in AI. The consensus across models suggests a significant likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc.
