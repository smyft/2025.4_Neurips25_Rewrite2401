(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's recent loss of market share to Huawei and Vivo in China's smartphone market, coupled with a significant drop in shipments, indicates increasing competitive pressure in a crucial market. Although Apple maintained the top position in the fourth quarter, its annual performance reveals a concerning trend with a 17% decline in shipments. The news of Apple's price cuts may help boost sales but reflects a struggle to compete with domestic brands amid US-China tensions. Overall, the competitive landscape and declining market presence suggest higher risks for the stock price. Hence, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While it regained the top spot in China's smartphone market in Q4, its overall market share for 2024 decreased, falling behind Vivo and Huawei. The 25% year-over-year shipment decline in Q4 and the 17% decline for the entire year are concerning. The intensified competition from Huawei, bolstered by domestic chips and patriotic consumer sentiment, poses a significant threat. Apple's efforts to counter this through price cuts and enhanced retail experiences suggest they are actively trying to mitigate the negative impact. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to the market and key competitors warrants a higher probability of a stock price fall. However, strong Q4 performance, trade-in programs and instalment plans are tailwinds. The forecasted increased shipments is also somewhat bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's decline in market share in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Vivo and Huawei in 2024, is a significant negative factor. While Apple briefly regained the top spot in Q4 2024, the overall trend shows a substantial year-on-year decline in shipments (17% for the full year and 25% in Q4).  The resurgence of Huawei, aided by new domestically produced chips, poses a strong competitive threat. Apple's response with price cuts indicates a struggle to maintain market share. Although the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance within this growth suggests weakening brand appeal in its crucial second-largest market.  The uncertainty surrounding the launch of its AI service in China adds to the risk. While the Q4 market share gain suggests some resilience, the long-term trend is concerning and likely outweighs the short-term positive. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed performance for Apple in China's smartphone market. While Apple recaptured the top spot in Q4 2024, its annual shipments fell by 17%, and it lost its leading position to Vivo and Huawei. The decline in shipments, particularly a 25% drop in Q4, reflects intense competition and challenges from domestic players like Huawei, which has seen significant growth. Additionally, Apple's reliance on discounts and promotions to boost sales indicates underlying demand weakness. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, which could provide some offsetting positive sentiment. Given the negative trends in market share and shipments, the news is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, outweighing any positive aspects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell to third place in China's smartphone market in 2024, trailing Huawei and Vivo. Apple's smartphone shipments in China plummeted 25% to 13.1 million units in the fourth quarter, and its full-year shipments fell 17% to 42.9 million units. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall decline in shipments and increased competition from domestic players are negative indicators for Apple's performance in China, a crucial market for the company. However, Apple has been offering discounts to boost sales, and Canalys forecasts a recovery in China's smartphone market. The mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook, but the overall negative trends may outweigh the positives in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, after a year of increasing competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's smartphone shipments in China have declined significantly in 2024, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows increased competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei. This could signal challenges for Apple in maintaining market share and potentially impact its financial performance and investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a challenging outlook for Apple Inc. in the Chinese smartphone market, highlighting a significant decline in shipments and a fall to third place behind Huawei and Vivo in 2024. Although Apple recaptured the top position in the fourth quarter, its overall performance shows a 17% annual decline in shipments, with a 25% drop in Q4 alone. The competitive pressure from domestic players is intensifying, particularly as Huawei has regained strength through new technologies and patriotic consumer sentiment. Despite efforts such as price cuts and enhancements in retail experience to counteract these trends, the negative trajectory of market share and shipments is alarming. Investor sentiment is likely to be impacted negatively by these developments. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans heavily towards a negative stock price reaction due to Apple's struggles in the Chinese smartphone market. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4, the annual decline in shipments and market share, coupled with rising competition from Huawei and Vivo, overshadows this positive aspect. Apple's use of discounts to boost sales is also viewed as a sign of weakness. The overarching theme is Apple's underperformance in its second most important market. The fact that previous rounds unanimously predicted a higher probability of price falling solidifies this sentiment. However, given the already pessimistic outlook, the potential for further negative surprise might be limited, so there is a small adjustment towards a more balanced view, while still favoring a price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While regaining the top spot in China's Q4 smartphone market is positive, the overall 2024 performance shows a concerning trend: a 17% year-on-year decline in shipments and a loss of the overall annual market share to Huawei and Vivo.  This signifies increasing competitive pressure from domestic players, particularly Huawei's resurgence fueled by new chips and nationalistic sentiment.  Apple's price cuts suggest a struggle to maintain competitiveness.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance within that recovery is the key negative.  The previous models' predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reinforcing this assessment.  Although the Q4 rebound and planned initiatives like trade-in programs and installment plans offer some mitigating factors, the substantial year-over-year decline and the intense competition are dominant factors suggesting a higher likelihood of a price drop. The consistent negative prediction from multiple models also strengthens the negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's mixed performance in China's smartphone market, where it regained the top spot in Q4 2024 but fell to third place for the full year due to intense competition from Huawei and Vivo. Apple's shipments declined by 25% in Q4 and 17% annually, reflecting significant competitive pressure. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to domestic brands, coupled with strategic price cuts and promotional efforts, suggests a struggle to maintain market share. Investor sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted by these trends, outweighing any short-term positive factors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell to third place in China's smartphone market in 2024, trailing Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, Apple's overall shipments in China declined by 17% for the full year. The significant drop in shipments, coupled with increasing competition from domestic players like Huawei, suggests a negative trend for Apple's performance in China, a crucial market for the company. The news of Apple's price cuts to boost sales reflects a struggle to compete with domestic brands amid US-China tensions. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance within this growth suggests weakening brand appeal in its second-largest market. The uncertainty surrounding the launch of its AI service in China adds to the risk. Considering these factors, the negative trends in market share and shipments are likely to outweigh the positives, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, with a significant decline in shipments. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows increased competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei. This could signal challenges for Apple in maintaining market share and potentially impact its financial performance and investor sentiment negatively. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative trends in Apple's market share and shipments, the estimated probabilities are aligned with this analysis.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's declining market share and reduced shipments in the Chinese smartphone market, a critical region for Apple. Despite a brief recovery in Q4 2024, the overall trend shows a significant year-over-year decline. Intense competition from domestic players like Huawei and Vivo, coupled with the challenge of launching new AI services amidst US-China tensions, poses considerable headwinds. These factors suggest ongoing pressures on Apple's ability to sustain market leadership and financial performance, influencing investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple in the Chinese smartphone market, where it has fallen to third place behind Huawei and Vivo for 2024, after experiencing a substantial decline in shipments (17% for the year and 25% in Q4). Although Apple regained the top position in Q4, this temporary success does not outweigh the concerning overall trend of increasing competition from domestic players, particularly Huawei, and the negative sentiment from price cuts being indicative of struggles to maintain market share. This situation, combined with uncertainties surrounding Apple's AI service launch amidst US-China tensions, suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price fall. The previous predictions from various models echo a consensus leaning towards a negative outlook for the company's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple's performance in China presents a mixed but ultimately concerning outlook. While a Q4 recovery provided a temporary boost, the full-year data reveals significant declines in shipments and market share, with Apple falling behind Huawei and Vivo. This intensifies competition, especially given Huawei's resurgence fueled by domestic chips and nationalist sentiment. The price cuts signal weakness in Apple's competitive positioning. Considering Apple\u2019s market performance is of crucial importance to its overall financials. The consistency in previous rounds pointing towards a greater likelihood of the stock price falling reinforces this view. There is a limited reason to deviate from this established sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple, despite the Q4 rebound.  The significant year-over-year decline in Chinese smartphone shipments (17% for the full year, 25% in Q4) and the loss of overall market share to Huawei and Vivo are major concerns. While regaining the top spot in Q4 offers a small positive, this is overshadowed by the larger trend.  Huawei's resurgence, driven by new domestic chips and patriotic sentiment, presents a serious long-term threat.  Apple's resorting to discounts suggests a struggle to compete effectively.  The previous predictions from various models consistently point towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reinforcing this negative outlook.  Although the recovering overall Chinese smartphone market and initiatives like trade-in programs offer some potential mitigating factors, the substantial market share loss and declining shipments are dominant negative indicators. The consistent negative prediction across multiple rounds strengthens the negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news presents a challenging outlook for Apple Inc. in the Chinese smartphone market, highlighting a significant decline in shipments and a fall to third place behind Huawei and Vivo in 2024.

Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, Apple's overall shipments in China declined by 17% for the full year. The significant drop in shipments, coupled with increasing competition from domestic players like Huawei, suggests a negative trend for Apple's performance in China, a crucial market for the company.

The company's efforts to counter this with price cuts and enhanced retail experiences suggest a struggle to maintain competitiveness. Considering the consistent negative predictions from previous models and the significant decline in shipments, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's declining shipments and a drop in market share in China's smartphone market. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the annual decline of 17% shows a concerning trend. Increased competition from Huawei and Vivo, particularly Huawei's robust growth due to domestic chips and nationalistic sentiment, pose significant threats. Apple's price cuts and promotional measures suggest challenges in maintaining market share. The overall sentiment among other predictions is strongly biased towards a stock price fall, likely due to the negative outlook provided by these factors. While the overall smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to the market and competitors adds to the risk. Given these considerations, the probability of a stock price fall remains high.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates significant challenges for Apple Inc. in the Chinese smartphone market, reflecting a substantial decline in shipments and a drop to third place behind domestic competitors Huawei and Vivo for the full year. Although Apple regained the top position in Q4, this is overshadowed by a 17% annual decline in shipments and a concerning 25% drop in Q4 shipments. The intense competition, especially from Huawei, further complicates Apple's efforts to maintain market share, as seen by the need for price cuts and promotions. The overall negative trends in market share and shipments are likely to weigh heavily on investor sentiment, resulting in a higher probability that the stock price will fall rather than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds and a thorough analysis of the news indicate a predominantly negative outlook for Apple (AAPL) stock. While a temporary Q4 recovery offered a brief respite, the overarching trend reveals concerning declines in shipments and market share, with Apple falling behind Huawei and Vivo in the crucial Chinese market. Huawei's resurgence, fueled by nationalistic sentiment and domestic chips, intensifies competition. Further weighing on investor sentiment are the significant annual shipment decline of 17% and the 25% drop in Q4 sales. The price cuts, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding AI service launch, signal weakness in Apple's competitive positioning. Given these factors and the consistency of previous predictions, the probability of a stock price fall remains elevated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese smartphone market presents a mixed picture. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4 2024, the overall 2024 performance shows a significant decline in shipments (17% year-over-year) and market share, falling behind Huawei and Vivo. This is a concerning trend, particularly given Huawei's resurgence fueled by domestic chip production and nationalistic consumer sentiment.  Apple's resorting to price cuts to stimulate sales further underscores the competitive pressure they are facing.  The consistent negative predictions from other models across multiple rounds strongly suggest a negative market reaction.  While the recovery in the overall Chinese smartphone market and initiatives like trade-in programs offer some potential mitigating factors, the substantial decline in Apple's shipments and market share in its second-largest market outweigh these positives.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise, although the Q4 performance offers some slight mitigating buffer compared to the extremely bearish predictions of others.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc. in the Chinese smartphone market, which is crucial for its financial performance. While Apple regained the top spot in Q4 2024, the overall trend shows a 17% decline in annual shipments and a fall to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. The competitive pressure from domestic players, especially Huawei, is intensifying, exacerbated by US-China tensions and patriotic consumer sentiment. Apple's reliance on price cuts and promotional efforts to boost sales indicates underlying demand weakness and a struggle to maintain market share. Despite the recovering overall Chinese smartphone market, Apple's underperformance relative to competitors is a concerning signal for investors.
