(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple trails Huawei, Vivo in China smartphone market in 2024, iPhone leads fourth quarter\nNews Content: Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's recent loss of market share to Huawei and Vivo in China's smartphone market, coupled with a significant drop in shipments, indicates increasing competitive pressure in a crucial market. Although Apple maintained the top position in the fourth quarter, its annual performance reveals a concerning trend with a 17% decline in shipments. The news of Apple's price cuts may help boost sales but reflects a struggle to compete with domestic brands amid US-China tensions. Overall, the competitive landscape and declining market presence suggest higher risks for the stock price. Hence, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While it regained the top spot in China's smartphone market in Q4, its overall market share for 2024 decreased, falling behind Vivo and Huawei. The 25% year-over-year shipment decline in Q4 and the 17% decline for the entire year are concerning. The intensified competition from Huawei, bolstered by domestic chips and patriotic consumer sentiment, poses a significant threat. Apple's efforts to counter this through price cuts and enhanced retail experiences suggest they are actively trying to mitigate the negative impact. While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance relative to the market and key competitors warrants a higher probability of a stock price fall. However, strong Q4 performance, trade-in programs and instalment plans are tailwinds. The forecasted increased shipments is also somewhat bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's decline in market share in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Vivo and Huawei in 2024, is a significant negative factor. While Apple briefly regained the top spot in Q4 2024, the overall trend shows a substantial year-on-year decline in shipments (17% for the full year and 25% in Q4).  The resurgence of Huawei, aided by new domestically produced chips, poses a strong competitive threat. Apple's response with price cuts indicates a struggle to maintain market share. Although the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance within this growth suggests weakening brand appeal in its crucial second-largest market.  The uncertainty surrounding the launch of its AI service in China adds to the risk. While the Q4 market share gain suggests some resilience, the long-term trend is concerning and likely outweighs the short-term positive. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed performance for Apple in China's smartphone market. While Apple recaptured the top spot in Q4 2024, its annual shipments fell by 17%, and it lost its leading position to Vivo and Huawei. The decline in shipments, particularly a 25% drop in Q4, reflects intense competition and challenges from domestic players like Huawei, which has seen significant growth. Additionally, Apple's reliance on discounts and promotions to boost sales indicates underlying demand weakness. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, which could provide some offsetting positive sentiment. Given the negative trends in market share and shipments, the news is likely to be perceived negatively by investors, outweighing any positive aspects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell to third place in China's smartphone market in 2024, trailing Huawei and Vivo. Apple's smartphone shipments in China plummeted 25% to 13.1 million units in the fourth quarter, and its full-year shipments fell 17% to 42.9 million units. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall decline in shipments and increased competition from domestic players are negative indicators for Apple's performance in China, a crucial market for the company. However, Apple has been offering discounts to boost sales, and Canalys forecasts a recovery in China's smartphone market. The mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook, but the overall negative trends may outweigh the positives in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to third place in the Chinese smartphone market in 2024, after a year of increasing competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Vivo. While Apple recaptured the top spot in the fourth quarter, its overall shipments in China have declined by 17% for the full year. The article also mentions that Apple is facing uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service in China and is offering rare discounts to boost sales. However, the overall Chinese smartphone market has seen a recovery, with shipments rising 5% in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, the negative news about Apple's declining market share and shipments in China may outweigh the positive news about the overall market recovery, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's smartphone shipments in China have declined significantly in 2024, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. Despite recapturing the top spot in the fourth quarter, the overall trend shows increased competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei. This could signal challenges for Apple in maintaining market share and potentially impact its financial performance and investor sentiment negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
