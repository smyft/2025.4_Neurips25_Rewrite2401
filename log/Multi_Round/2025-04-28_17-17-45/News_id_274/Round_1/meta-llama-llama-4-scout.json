(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China, dropping to third place with a significant decline in shipments. Meanwhile, competitors like Huawei and vivo have experienced substantial growth. Apple's drop in market performance and the rise of competition, especially in a key market like China, could lead to negative investor sentiment and impact stock performance. Additionally, while the overall smartphone market is growing, Apple's inability to capitalize on this growth is concerning. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price decline due to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's significant drop in market share in the crucial Chinese smartphone market is the primary concern.  While the overall Chinese market grew, Apple experienced a substantial 17% year-over-year decline in shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This indicates weakening demand for Apple products in China, a major market for the company. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, fueled by government subsidies and promotions, directly impacts Apple's sales. Although Canalys predicts continued growth in the overall Chinese market, Apple's inability to maintain its position suggests a potential continuation of the negative trend.  The positive aspects of the overall market growth and Canalys's optimistic forecast for 2025 are somewhat mitigated by Apple's specific performance struggles in China. While Apple's overall global performance may cushion the blow, the substantial loss of market share in such a significant region will likely weigh negatively on investor sentiment in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments and a 25% year-over-year decline in Q4 2024. This is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which saw significant growth. The negative trend in Apple's performance in a key market like China is likely to weigh on investor sentiment, as China is a major revenue driver for Apple. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's loss of ground to competitors suggests potential revenue and margin pressures. This negative outlook is likely to outweigh any positive aspects of the broader market recovery.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, dropping to third place with 42.9 million shipments in 2024, a 17% drop from 2023. Vivo and Huawei surged ahead with significant growth, 14% and 37% respectively. In Q4, Apple led but saw a 25% drop in sales compared to the same period in 2023. This negative performance in a key market could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the overall smartphone market growth and positive outlook for 2025 might mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024' indicates a decline in Apple's market share in China, which is a significant market for the company. The data shows a 17% drop in Apple's shipments in 2024 and a 25% drop in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests that Apple is facing increased competition in the Chinese market. As a result, the probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued decline in Apple's market share in the Chinese smartphone market, driven by stronger performance by local competitors like Huawei and vivo. Despite strong overall market growth, Apple's shipment drop of 25% in Q4 reflects challenges in competing against these brands. This suggests potential concerns over market share loss which could impact investor sentiment negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
