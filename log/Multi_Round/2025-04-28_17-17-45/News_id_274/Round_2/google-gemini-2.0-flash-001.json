(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024\nNews Content: Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday. Rising demand across all sectors drove the recovery; suppliers used smart investments and technology improvements.\n\nComprising 17% of all shipments, vivo dominated the market with 49.3 million devices delivered. With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost market share in Mainland China, dropping to third place with a significant decline in shipments. Meanwhile, competitors like Huawei and vivo have experienced substantial growth. Apple's drop in market performance and the rise of competition, especially in a key market like China, could lead to negative investor sentiment and impact stock performance. Additionally, while the overall smartphone market is growing, Apple's inability to capitalize on this growth is concerning. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price decline due to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a crucial market for the company. While the overall market is recovering, Apple is losing ground to Huawei and vivo. The fourth-quarter results show a steeper decline, with Apple's shipments dropping 25% compared to the previous year. This negative performance in China is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential sell-off of Apple stock. Although the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in 2025, there is no guarantee Apple will regain its lost market share. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, coupled with government support for local brands, poses a strong competitive challenge for Apple. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than that of it rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's significant drop in market share in the crucial Chinese smartphone market is the primary concern.  While the overall Chinese market grew, Apple experienced a substantial 17% year-over-year decline in shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This indicates weakening demand for Apple products in China, a major market for the company. The rise of domestic competitors like Huawei and vivo, fueled by government subsidies and promotions, directly impacts Apple's sales. Although Canalys predicts continued growth in the overall Chinese market, Apple's inability to maintain its position suggests a potential continuation of the negative trend.  The positive aspects of the overall market growth and Canalys's optimistic forecast for 2025 are somewhat mitigated by Apple's specific performance struggles in China. While Apple's overall global performance may cushion the blow, the substantial loss of market share in such a significant region will likely weigh negatively on investor sentiment in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's declining market share in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a 17% drop in shipments and a 25% year-over-year decline in Q4 2024. This is attributed to increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and vivo, which saw significant growth. The negative trend in Apple's performance in a key market like China is likely to weigh on investor sentiment, as China is a major revenue driver for Apple. While the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's loss of ground to competitors suggests potential revenue and margin pressures. This negative outlook is likely to outweigh any positive aspects of the broader market recovery.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, dropping to third place with 42.9 million shipments in 2024, a 17% drop from 2023. Vivo and Huawei surged ahead with significant growth, 14% and 37% respectively. In Q4, Apple led but saw a 25% drop in sales compared to the same period in 2023. This negative performance in a key market could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the overall smartphone market growth and positive outlook for 2025 might mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Loses Ground in Mainland China's Smartphone Market as Huawei and vivo Surge in 2024' indicates a decline in Apple's market share in China, which is a significant market for the company. The data shows a 17% drop in Apple's shipments in 2024 and a 25% drop in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2023. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests that Apple is facing increased competition in the Chinese market. As a result, the probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued decline in Apple's market share in the Chinese smartphone market, driven by stronger performance by local competitors like Huawei and vivo. Despite strong overall market growth, Apple's shipment drop of 25% in Q4 reflects challenges in competing against these brands. This suggests potential concerns over market share loss which could impact investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, where it dropped to third place with a 17% decrease in shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales compared to the previous year. This extensive loss suggests weakening demand for Apple's products in a crucial market, where local competitors like Huawei and vivo are gaining traction. While the overall smartphone market is expected to grow in the coming years, Apple's specific struggles in China could negatively influence investor sentiment. The sources agree on a higher probability of stock price decline due to these market challenges, reflecting substantial concerns surrounding Apple's competitive position in a major revenue area.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from previous rounds, all pointing to a 0.3/0.7 split in probabilities, reinforces the bearish outlook based on the news. Apple's continued decline in a key market like China, coupled with the surge of domestic competitors, overshadows the overall market's growth. Given the consensus and the lack of any significantly offsetting positive news, I will slightly adjust the probability towards higher price drop to account for the trend indicated by the previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a significant loss of market share for Apple in the crucial Chinese smartphone market.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is growing, Apple's decline of 17% year-over-year and a sharp 25% drop in Q4 2024 sales are alarming.  The rise of Huawei and vivo, aided by government subsidies, presents a strong competitive challenge.  Although the forecast for 2025 is positive for the overall market, Apple's inability to capitalize on this growth, especially in such a large market, is a major negative. The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a stock price fall. While Apple's overall global performance and other product lines might mitigate the impact somewhat, the significant negative news regarding a major market segment like China is likely to negatively affect investor sentiment in the short term.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher, though not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall robustness of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, a critical market for the company. Apple's shipments dropped by 17% in 2024 and 25% in Q4, while competitors like Huawei and vivo saw substantial growth. This indicates weakening demand for Apple products in China and increased competition from domestic brands. Although the overall smartphone market in China is recovering, Apple's inability to capitalize on this growth is concerning. Given the negative sentiment from investors due to these factors, it is more likely that the stock price will fall in the short term. The consensus from previous predictions also supports this outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to a price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has lost ground in Mainland China's smartphone market, with a significant decline in shipments and a rise in competitors like Huawei and vivo. This decline in a crucial market, combined with the substantial growth of domestic competitors, suggests a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. While the overall smartphone market is expected to grow, Apple's specific performance issues in China, including a 17% drop in shipments and a 25% decline in Q4 sales, are likely to weigh on investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in Apple's market share in Mainland China, with a 17% drop in shipments and a 25% year-over-year decline in Q4 2024. This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests that Apple is facing increased competition in the Chinese market. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which largely indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to Apple's loss of market share and increased competition, the overall trend suggests that the negative impact of this news on Apple's stock price is more likely than a positive impact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued decline in Apple's market share in the Chinese smartphone market, driven by stronger performance by local competitors like Huawei and vivo. Despite strong overall market growth, Apple's shipment drop of 25% in Q4 reflects challenges in competing against these brands. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The substantial loss of market share in such a significant region is likely to weigh negatively on investor sentiment, impacting the stock price more negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
