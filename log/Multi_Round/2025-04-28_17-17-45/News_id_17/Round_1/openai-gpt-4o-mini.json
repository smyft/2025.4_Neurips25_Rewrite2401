(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trending tickers: Apple, Intel, Novartis, Shell, Smiths Group\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL)\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday, following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure. Next steps will be closely watched, with Engine also floating the possibility of a US listing for its John Crane energy services arm which Engine describes as its jewel in the crown.\u201d\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SMIN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's quarterly profit and sales report exceeded estimates, leading to a 3.4% increase in premarket trading. While services revenue growth is strong, concerns remain regarding the slow rollout of AI features and declining revenue from China. Overall, the positive earnings report suggests bullish sentiment, yet worries about competitive pressure in the AI space temper optimism. This combination indicates a higher likelihood of price increase but not without risk, hence a moderate probability for both rising and falling stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple is mixed but leans positive. The initial premarket surge of 3.4% indicates positive investor sentiment driven by better-than-expected quarterly results (sales +4%, net income +7%, services +14%). This momentum is a strong indicator of a likely rise. However, there are cautionary notes. Revenue from China declined significantly (-11%), and analysts pointed out the slow and limited rollout of Apple Intelligence, particularly its lack of non-English language support. This raises concerns about wider adoption and could limit future gains. The year-to-date performance is negative (-2.6%), which suggests existing pressures. Taking both positive and negative aspects, and the fact that an analyst has predicted growth, I believe a rise is slightly more probable than a fall, but there is still a significant chance of the price dropping given the limitations that have been pointed out. I've assigned slightly higher probability to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's stock experienced a premarket surge of 3.4% following a strong earnings report that exceeded expectations.  While net income and sales showed healthy growth, concerns remain regarding the slow rollout of AI services, particularly the lack of non-English language support and the cautious approach to AI integration. Analyst commentary expresses mixed sentiment; one analyst highlights the positive results, while another points to the potential for this restrained AI strategy to hinder consumer upgrades and therefore future growth.  The year-to-date decline of 2.6% reflects broader tech sector anxieties related to Chinese AI competition.  Considering the positive earnings report and premarket jump, the probability of a price rise is higher. However, the reservations expressed about the AI strategy introduce a degree of uncertainty, suggesting a non-negligible probability of a price fall, especially if these concerns materialize into slower than expected growth in the future. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket following a quarterly profit and sales report that exceeded estimates. Net income and sales were up, with significant growth in services revenue, though revenue from China declined. Analysts noted the strong quarter and the introduction of Apple Intelligence as positive factors. However, concerns were raised about the slow rollout of AI services and competition from Chinese AI challengers. The overall sentiment is mixed but leans positive due to the earnings beat and growth expectations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported a quarterly profit and sales that exceeded estimates, with a 7% increase in net income and a 4% increase in sales compared to the same quarter last year. Services revenue saw a significant 14% increase, although revenue from China was down 11%. The company expects 'low to mid-single digits' growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Despite the positive earnings report, concerns about Apple's approach to AI and its late entry into the AI market might temper investor enthusiasm. However, the immediate premarket reaction was a 3.4% increase in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales exceeded estimates, with a 7% increase in net income and a 4% increase in sales. The company's services revenue also saw a 14% growth. However, the report also mentions that Apple's rollout of AI services has been cautious, and the company still hasn't rolled out AI services in non-English languages. Despite this, the overall tone of the report is positive, with analyst Neil Wilson calling it a 'very strong quarter'. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to the positive earnings report and growth in services revenue.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has released strong quarterly earnings and sales reports, surpassing analysts' estimates and showing growth in certain areas such as services revenue. However, there are concerns regarding the slower-than-expected AI service rollouts. The positive earnings report suggests potential for stock price rise, whereas the mixed reactions from analysts create some uncertainty.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
