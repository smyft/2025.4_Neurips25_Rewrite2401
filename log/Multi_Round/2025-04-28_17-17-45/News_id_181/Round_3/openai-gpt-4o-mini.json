(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple remains a significant part of Warren Buffett's portfolio, reaffirming investor confidence in the company, especially given its focus on AI technology in upcoming products. The overall positive sentiment surrounding both Buffett\u2019s investment decisions and Apple\u2019s role in AI could lead to an increase in stock price. However, the fact that Buffett has reduced his position in Apple might suggest some uncertainty. Thus, while the probability of a price rise is high, there is also some risk, which is reflected in a moderate probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is a significant holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio and that Buffett's team has invested in Apple for its AI capabilities. While Berkshire Hathaway recently reduced its stake in Apple, the news emphasizes that Apple remains its largest holding with 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The fact that Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected suggests that Apple's stock might be viewed positively by other investors due to this validation. It's likely to create positive investor sentiment. The news emphasizes that Apple's AI strategy has been implemented with the integration of AI features such as writing enhancement tools, priority notifications, and Siri's makeover and the integration with ChatGPT.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (22.7% of its portfolio), and that Apple is actively integrating AI into its products and services.  While the article mentions Berkshire Hathaway *reducing* its Apple holdings previously, the continued substantial investment suggests continued confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. The focus on AI integration is positive, as AI is a high-growth sector.  However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate, considering Apple's already high valuation and the fact that the news is not entirely unexpected given Apple's existing investments in AI.  The probability of a price rise will be influenced by market sentiment and other broader economic factors. Therefore, I assign moderate probabilities to both rise and fall, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the positive AI-related news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant part of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of it. The article emphasizes Apple's strategic focus on AI, including new hardware and software innovations like Apple Intelligence, which could position the company as a major distributor of AI to consumers. Despite Berkshire selling some shares, Apple remains its largest holding, suggesting continued confidence in its long-term potential. The positive emphasis on AAPL's AI advancements and its strong market position is likely to be viewed favorably by investors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 billion portfolio is invested in four AI stocks: Domino's Pizza, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Apple. Apple constitutes 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and has been preparing for the AI revolution with its Apple Intelligence software and new hardware. Despite Berkshire Hathaway selling over half of its Apple position, Apple remains the largest holding. The positive mention of Apple's AI strategy and its potential to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers could boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a rise in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment in four artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given Buffett's reputation as a savvy investor and his significant stake in Apple, this news could be seen as a positive endorsement of the company's potential in the AI space. Additionally, the article highlights Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, which could lead to increased revenue and growth. However, it's worth noting that Berkshire Hathaway has already taken profits by selling over half of its Apple position, which might limit the potential upside. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article suggests that Apple's investment in AI could lead to long-term growth, which would likely have a positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights four major holdings in Warren Buffett's portfolio related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). It emphasizes that Apple constitutes a significant portion of the portfolio, at 22.7%. Given Buffett\u2019s reputation and the emphasis on AI's transformative nature in these companies, the focus on Apple's advancements in AI suggests increased investor interest and potentially positive market sentiment towards Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights that a significant portion of Warren Buffett's portfolio is invested in Apple, which remains a key player in the AI sector with ongoing developments in AI integration across its product line. The general sentiment surrounding Buffett's investment choices tends to create positive investor confidence. While there has been a reduction in Apple holdings, the emphasis on its AI advancements suggests strong long-term potential. However, this reduction may introduce some caution among investors, impacting the overall bullish sentiment. Taking into account the previous predictions, which range from a 60% to 75% probability of price increase, I estimate a slightly conservative yet positive outlook for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant role in Warren Buffett's portfolio and its strategic focus on AI. While Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake, Apple remains its largest holding, indicating continued confidence. The integration of AI into Apple's products and services, like Apple Intelligence and Siri, is likely to be viewed positively by investors. The previous round models consistently assigned a higher probability for a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75, suggesting a consensus about the positive impact of this news. Following this precedence and considering the continued high stake of Berkshire Hathaway, I will keep a high rise probability, slightly adjusted downward by the fact some holdings were reduced.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Warren Buffett's AI-focused investments, with Apple being a significant holding (22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio). While Buffett has reduced his Apple stake, it remains his largest holding, suggesting continued confidence in Apple's long-term growth, especially considering its AI initiatives (Apple Intelligence).  Previous models largely predict a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 probability. The positive sentiment around Apple's AI strategy, its massive user base, and the implicit endorsement from Buffett, outweigh the previously reported reduction in holdings.  However, the market is already aware of Apple's AI efforts and its large valuation, meaning the impact might be less dramatic than if this were entirely unexpected news.  Therefore, while a price rise is more likely, the probability is tempered by the market's existing knowledge and potential saturation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments. Despite Berkshire selling some shares, Apple remains its largest holding, indicating continued confidence in Apple's long-term potential. The article emphasizes Apple's strategic focus on AI, including new hardware and software innovations like Apple Intelligence, which could position the company as a major distributor of AI to consumers. Given Buffett's reputation as a savvy investor and the positive sentiment around AI advancements, this news is likely to be viewed favorably by the market. However, the fact that Berkshire has reduced its stake introduces some uncertainty, which tempers the probability of a significant rise. Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the negative, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Warren Buffett and his company show continued confidence in Apple, despite reducing their stake. The news emphasizes Apple's focus on AI technology and its implementations, such as Apple Intelligence, which could strengthen its competitive position in the growing AI market. This positive sentiment and ongoing investment from Berkshire Hathaway suggest that investor confidence in Apple remains high. However, the reduction in stake might introduce a small degree of uncertainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which remains a key player in the AI sector. As Apple accounts for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, it underscores continued confidence from a highly respected investor. The company's ongoing focus on AI integration is expected to resonate positively with investors. Despite a reduction in Berkshire's stake, the fact that Apple is still the largest holding suggests a long-term bullish outlook. The previous predictions from various models showed a consensus towards a positive price movement, generally supporting probabilities of a rise around 0.65 to 0.75. I estimate a high probability for a price rise given the overall positive sentiment driven by Buffett's endorsement and the strategic initiatives in AI.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's AI strategy and its prominent position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, despite a reduction in holdings. The consensus from previous predictions leans towards a price increase. Apple's AI integration and Buffett's continued confidence, while tempered by the reduced stake, suggest positive market sentiment. Considering all factors, a slight adjustment downwards from the higher probabilities given earlier in the rounds seems appropriate, given it may already be baked into the price but its still a major position in a highly respected portfolio.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is positive for Apple, highlighting its significant presence (22.7%) in Warren Buffett's portfolio despite a previous reduction in holdings.  This reinforces confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, particularly given its ongoing investments in AI through initiatives like Apple Intelligence.  However, the prior reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's holdings introduces some level of uncertainty.  The consistent prediction of a price rise across multiple models in previous rounds, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75, supports the bullish sentiment.  Considering both the positive AI-related news and the tempered impact of Berkshire's reduced stake, I estimate a moderately high probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, accounting for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments.
