(AAPL)\nNews Headline: India Urges Apple, Google to Host Government App Suite Amid Resistance\nNews Content: The Indian government has requested Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores to enhance public access to government services, Bloomberg News reported, citing individuals familiar with the matter.\n\nMeeting with officials from Apple, Google, and other smartphone companies last month, India's technology minister proposed direct user access to the government-backed software suite. Officials recommended that the applications be pre-installed on Indian-sold handsets and made accessible for download free from warnings including \"untrusted source.\"\n\nGoogle, whose Android operating system runs over 90% of India's around 700 million cellphones, is apparently turning down the demand. Apple is also reported to be reluctant to cooperate. The government has said it could use legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance.\n\nBelieving the GOV.in app suite might increase utilization if combined into a single package in the app stores, the ministry seeks to spread public-welfare services via technology. Right now, Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store each include separate apps.\n\nApple also made a similar action in 2021 in Russia, giving consumers the choice to install government-recommended applications to follow local rules.\n\nTo protect the mobile ecosystem, Google has apparently shown a readiness to work with Indian authorities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This resistance could lead to potential legal actions or policy directives from the Indian government, which might negatively impact Apple's and Google's operations in India. However, the article also notes that Apple has made similar concessions in other countries, such as Russia, and Google has shown a willingness to work with Indian authorities. Given the relatively minor nature of this news and the potential for Apple to find a compromise, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively balanced, but slightly leaning towards a neutral to slightly negative impact.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"India Urges Apple, Google to Host Government App Suite Amid Resistance\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}"
