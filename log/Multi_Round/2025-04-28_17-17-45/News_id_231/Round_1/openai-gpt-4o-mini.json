(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses investing mistakes and reflects on complacency regarding Apple's growth. While it acknowledges Apple's strong brand and revenue figures, it also highlights potential headwinds and competition. The author's personal reflections suggest a cautious approach to Apple, indicating that investors should remain vigilant. This nuanced view may lead to a mixed market reaction, thereby decreasing the likelihood of a significant rise in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, since the company is generally viewed favorably, the probability of a rise remains moderately high. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher likelihood of price stability or a slight rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's past investing mistakes and specifically mentions Apple as a company they've held for a long time, but have become somewhat complacent about. While the author acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, existing products), they also point out that its growth has slowed down compared to other companies, and it faces headwinds. This suggests a more neutral perspective on Apple's future performance, as past high growth rates are recognized as potentially unsustainable. The article does not mention any other negative aspects about the short/mid-term performance. \n\nThe fact that the author holds a position long-term, and the article suggests that it is still a favorable investment, tempers any strong expectations of decline. The call to action is diligence instead of selling, suggesting that there may be positive change in the future. The 'Double Down' promotional element at the end of the article is also not specific to Apple and thus does not significantly affect the analysis.\n\nTaking everything into account, I'm assuming slightly greater probability that the stock price might decrease minimally in the very short term due to highlighting potentially less sensational growth, but the overall investment thesis, however, remains favorable in the longer term. This analysis takes into consideration that the average retail investor does not read investment articles deeply, and will see the term 'complacency' as a negative signal rather than a cause for deeper analysis of fundamentals.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple. While acknowledging Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the author points out that Apple's growth rate has slowed, and there's no guarantee of continued boom times.  The author's self-critique highlights a potential for underestimation of market headwinds and the need for more diligent analysis, suggesting a need for caution in future forecasts for AAPL. However, the article does not present any new negative information about Apple itself or predict an imminent downturn; rather, it focuses on the author's personal investment approach.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in either direction, implying probabilities closer to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, with the third point focusing on complacency regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance but notes that its growth metrics (revenue and free cash flow) are slower compared to other companies, and it faces headwinds in its core markets. This reflection suggests a more cautious outlook on Apple's future performance, though the author still considers it a favorable investment. The article does not provide any immediate negative catalysts for Apple's stock but highlights the need for ongoing diligence. Given the tone of the article, it is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term, but it may prompt some investors to reassess their positions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses subtle investing mistakes and mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency and the need for ongoing diligence in investing. The author holds Apple stock and mentions that despite the company's impressive brand and past performance, its growth may not continue at the same pace due to market penetration and competition. However, the article does not provide any direct negative news about Apple or its future prospects. Instead, it highlights the importance of not being complacent and continuously evaluating investment theses. Given that the article does not present any specific negative developments or surprises about Apple, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the emphasis on not assuming perpetual growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes that the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond, using Apple, Pfizer, and Costco as examples. The author reflects on their past investment decisions and acknowledges mistakes such as not updating their investment thesis, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. Regarding Apple, the author notes that despite its impressive growth, there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. The author's tone is cautionary, suggesting a need for ongoing diligence and thesis updates. This introspection does not indicate a strong positive or negative outlook for Apple's stock price, but rather a call for careful consideration of market dynamics and potential risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of constant updating of investment theses, performing due diligence, and avoiding complacency. While Apple is mentioned as an example of complacency, the news does not provide specific negative information directly linked to the company's performance or prospects. It rather focuses on the author's personal experience and mistakes. Given the strong fundamentals and resilience of a company like Apple, the probability of stock price rising remains relatively high despite these reflections.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
