While this is generally positive sentiment, it's retrospective. The news doesn't contain any specific catalysts for immediate stock price appreciation. It's more of a long-term endorsement based on past performance. Thus the probability of the stock price rising is not high. There's minimal indication of any negative factors, making a significant fall unlikely as well. Most likely, there will be no real effect on the stock. Considering market volatility, there has to be some small probability for the stock to rise or fall, though these would be small.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"3 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks to Consider\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
