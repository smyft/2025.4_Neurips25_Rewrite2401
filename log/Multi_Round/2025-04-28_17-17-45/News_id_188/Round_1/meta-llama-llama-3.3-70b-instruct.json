(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin smartphone, potentially capturing market interest before Apple does. This could lead to increased competition in the high-end smartphone market, impacting Apple's perceived edge and possibly leading to a negative sentiment among investors. However, Apple's loyal customer base and upcoming product innovations could mitigate negative effects. The impact on stock prices may reflect both immediate competitive concerns and long-term brand loyalty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching a new ultrathin phone (Galaxy S25 Edge) ahead of Apple, potentially capturing market share in this emerging product category. This first-mover advantage for Samsung could negatively impact Apple's potential sales in the ultrathin phone market, at least in the short term. However, the article also suggests Apple will launch its own ultrathin iPhone later in the year. The long-term impact depends on the quality, pricing, and marketing of both Samsung's and Apple's products and public reception. The information around Apple venturing into 'ultrathin phones' has been 'reported' by Bloomberg News, so is not a new revelation. Overall the news appears to be moderately negative for Apple stock as Samsung seems to be leading the push into a new form factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone before Apple, potentially capturing a first-mover advantage in this new market segment. While this could impact Apple's sales, the overall effect on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  Apple's market dominance extends beyond a single product category, and its success relies on a diverse portfolio of products and services.  The introduction of a competing ultrathin phone is not likely to significantly alter Apple's overall market position or earning forecast, leading to a low probability of a significant price fluctuation in either direction. The article also highlights that Apple's upcoming ultrathin phone is expected to be a bold design change, suggesting that Apple's strategy isn't entirely reactive. The news primarily highlights Samsung's actions, not a significant threat to Apple's long-term prospects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, which could potentially compete with Apple's anticipated iPhone Air. This could be seen as a negative for Apple in the short term, as Samsung may gain market share by introducing the product earlier (mid-year vs. Apple's typical September launch). Additionally, Apple's past attempts with new form factors (mini and Plus models) have not been very successful, which might raise concerns about the success of the iPhone Air. However, Apple has a strong brand loyalty and ecosystem, which might mitigate some of the negative impact. The news is unlikely to have a dramatic immediate effect on Apple's stock, but the competition could weigh slightly on sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to the market in this category. This could be perceived as a competitive threat to Apple's market share, particularly if Samsung's product gains significant traction. Historically, Apple's stock price has been sensitive to competitive dynamics in the tech industry. Given that Apple is expected to launch its own ultrathin iPhone later this year, the news might create short-term uncertainty or negative sentiment among investors, potentially leading to a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and history of innovation could mitigate this impact. Based on this analysis, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term due to competitive concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to this new category. This could potentially give Samsung a competitive edge in the market and impact Apple's sales. As a result, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is lower, while the probability of it falling is higher. The exact probabilities depend on various factors such as Apple's overall market position, consumer preferences, and the company's ability to respond to the competition.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive advantage in the smartphone market. This could lead to increased market share for Samsung, which may negatively impact Apple's sales. However, Apple is planning to introduce its own ultrathin model later in the year, which might mitigate some of the negative effects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
