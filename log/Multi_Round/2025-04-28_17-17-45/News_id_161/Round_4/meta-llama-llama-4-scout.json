In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

(AAPL) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The article presents a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance in the fourth quarter with record revenues largely driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. Additionally, AAPL ranks among the best Dow stocks according to hedge fund sentiment, which can positively influence investor perception. While the overall market sentiment is skewed towards AI stocks, the growth in AAPL's infrastructure and robust sales figures suggest that it's a solid investment within the Dow. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising as the favorable news may attract buying interest.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong performance, including revenue growth, especially in iPhones and services, exceeding 1 billion paid memberships. It also mentions Apple's dominance in the consumer electronics sector and its increasing demand in AI, which is generally positive for tech stocks which can drive demand for AAPL's products. Apple is also a leading player in wearable tech. Hedge fund interest in Apple is significant, further suggesting market confidence. On the other hand, the article suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns compared to Apple in the immediate future. Furthermore, the article positions Apple at number 5 on the list of the best Dow stocks to buy, implying other stocks may have greater growth potential. While the article does not contain explicitly negative information, the comparison to AI Stocks and ranking could reduce positive sentiment. Therefore, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a rise in stock price given all the information but not by a wide margin.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple reported record revenue and strong growth in its services sector, the article emphasizes the potential of AI stocks to outperform Apple in the shorter term.  The article ranks Apple 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy now based on hedge fund sentiment, suggesting a positive, but not overwhelmingly bullish, outlook.  The mention of CDT Capital Management's cautious view on the overvaluation of AI stocks, even while acknowledging their potential, introduces a note of uncertainty. Overall, the article highlights Apple's strong performance but doesn't provide compelling reasons for an immediate significant price surge.  The probability of a price rise is therefore tempered by the comparison to other, higher-ranked, AI stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance, including record revenue in Q4 2024, driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. The company's solid position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, coupled with positive market trends in tech stocks due to AI advancements and overall economic optimism, suggests a favorable outlook. However, the article also mentions concerns about 'unhinged' valuations in the tech sector, which could introduce some volatility. Despite this, the overall sentiment appears positive, with AAPL being ranked among the best Dow stocks to buy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now. It highlights the company's strong performance, with record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, a 6% rise from the previous year. The article also mentions Apple's dominant position in the consumer electronics sector, its growing services sector, and its high-end ecosystem of goods, services, and software. These factors contribute to a positive sentiment around the stock. However, the article also mentions that the conviction for Apple's growth lies in its potential to keep up with AI-related advancements, but other AI stocks might hold greater promise. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the article does not provide overwhelmingly positive indicators that would significantly increase the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now, highlighting its solid financial performance, dominance in the consumer electronics sector, and growth in its Services business segment. The company's record revenue and strong iPhone sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also mentioned. However, the article notes that AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, which might impact AAPL's growth potential. Considering the overall positive tone of the article and the current market trends, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong quarterly results and continued dominance in the consumer electronics sector. However, the article suggests a preference for AI stocks over AAPL based on the potential for higher returns in the short term. Despite this, AAPL is ranked fifth among the best Dow stocks to buy, suggesting it still holds significant appeal. The bullish trend in tech stocks and the overall positive economic outlook might support further gains.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on its strong financial performance in the last quarter and its position in the Dow. The record revenue driven by iPhone sales and growth in the services segment are significant positive indicators. However, the discussion about AI stocks outperforming AAPL in the short term may temper the overall bullish sentiment. Additionally, the ranking of AAPL as the fifth best Dow stock suggests there are other stocks that could capture more investor interest. Considering these diverse sentiments and the mixed signals from hedge fund sentiments, I estimate a moderate probability of price rise but not overwhelmingly positive.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The previous rounds have shown a consistent leaning towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL), with probabilities of a price rise generally in the 0.6-0.75 range. The article presents a mixed view, highlighting Apple's strengths (revenue growth, iPhone sales, services sector) but also suggesting AI stocks might offer higher immediate returns. However, Apple's ranking among the best Dow stocks and continued hedge fund interest suggest underlying confidence. Given the general trend, I will nudge the probability slightly higher, and balance with caution about AI stock, Trump AI startup initiative also pumping the tech stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 2024 results are strong, showcasing record revenue driven by iPhone sales and Services growth, the article emphasizes the potential for AI stocks to outperform in the short term.  Apple's ranking as the 5th best Dow stock to buy, based on hedge fund sentiment, suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly bullish outlook. The mention of cautious perspectives on AI stock valuations introduces uncertainty.  Considering the strong fundamentals, positive market trends (though AI is currently favored), and the overall positive but not exceptionally enthusiastic tone, a moderate probability of price increase is likely. The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, with a median around 0.65. Considering this, and the mixed nature of the news, I'll slightly adjust downwards to account for the AI stock comparison.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance in Q4 2024 with record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and expansion in the services segment. AAPL's inclusion among the best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment further reinforces a bullish perspective. However, the article also notes that AI stocks may offer higher short-term returns, which could temper some investor enthusiasm for AAPL. Previous analysis by other models also indicated a favorable but cautious sentiment, with probabilities of stock price rise slightly outweighing fall. Considering the mixed but overall optimistic stance of the article and the context provided by other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance in the fourth quarter with record revenues largely driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. Additionally, AAPL ranks among the best Dow stocks according to hedge fund sentiment, which can positively influence investor perception. However, the article also mentions that other AI stocks might offer higher returns compared to Apple in the immediate future, which could temper the enthusiasm. Considering the overall positive tone and the current market trends, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance in the fourth quarter, dominance in the consumer electronics sector, and growth in its services segment. However, it also suggests that AI stocks might hold greater promise for higher returns in the short term. Considering the overall tone and market trends, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The fact that AAPL ranks fifth among the best Dow stocks to buy and is favored by hedge funds further supports a positive outlook. Yet, the comparison to AI stocks and the mention of potential overvaluation introduce some uncertainty, tempering the probability of a significant price surge.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong quarterly results and continued dominance in the consumer electronics sector. The article suggests a preference for AI stocks over AAPL for potentially higher returns in the short term. However, AAPL ranks among the best Dow stocks and is favored by positive market trends and hedge fund sentiment. The overall sentiment remains mixed but leans bullish due to Apple's consistent strong performance and its ranking among top Dow stocks.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong financial performance, particularly in Q4 2024, with record revenues driven by iPhone and services sales. Despite ranking fifth among the best Dow stocks and potential concerns about AI stocks outperforming AAPL in the short term, the overall sentiment remains favorable, supported by strong hedge fund interest. The mixed signals regarding AI stock competition lead to a slightly tempered bullish expectation but overall indicate a higher probability for price increases given the solid fundamentals and market positioning.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The consistently positive, albeit tempered, outlook for Apple (AAPL) persists. The news acknowledges AAPL's strong financials, particularly iPhone sales and service growth, but contrasts its near-term potential with AI stocks. The ranking of 5th 'best Dow stock' implies alternatives. However, hedge fund interest remains a positive signal. Considering the trend from prior rounds converging around 0.6-0.7 for a price increase and accounting for general market optimism and AI interest, probability trends slightly upwards. It maintains overall position strength, but AI-driven growth is seen elsewhere.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While strong Q4 2024 results, including record revenue and growth in services, are positive, the article emphasizes the potential for AI stocks to outperform in the short term.  Apple's ranking as a top Dow stock is bullish, but not overwhelmingly so.  Previous predictions show a consistent leaning towards a price rise, but with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75, indicating uncertainty.  The mention of potential AI stock overvaluation introduces a cautionary note. Considering the strong fundamentals, positive market trends, and the overall positive but not exceptionally enthusiastic tone, a moderate probability of price increase seems appropriate. The consensus from previous models and the mixed signals in the news itself lead to a more conservative prediction than some individual models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong Q4 2024 performance with record revenue driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. AAPL's inclusion among the best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment further supports a bullish perspective. However, the article also notes that AI stocks may offer higher short-term returns, which could temper some investor enthusiasm for AAPL. Previous predictions from other models ranged from 0.55 to 0.75 for a price rise, with a median around 0.65. Considering the strong fundamentals, positive market trends, and the overall positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic tone, I estimate a moderate probability of price increase, slightly adjusted to account for the AI stock comparison.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance in Q4 2024 with record revenue driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. AAPL is ranked among the best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment, which supports a bullish perspective. However, the article also notes that AI stocks may offer higher short-term returns, which could temper some investor enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering the mixed but overall optimistic stance of the article and the context provided by previous predictions, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple Inc.

Yet, the comparison to AI stocks and potential overvaluation introduce some uncertainty, leading to a moderate probability estimate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong quarterly results and continued dominance in the consumer electronics sector. The article suggests a preference for AI stocks over AAPL for potentially higher returns in the short term. However, AAPL ranks among the best Dow stocks and is favored by positive market trends and hedge fund sentiment. The overall sentiment remains mixed but leans bullish due to Apple's consistent strong performance and its ranking among top Dow stocks.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong financial performance, particularly record revenues in Q4 2024 driven by iPhone sales and expanded services. Apple is ranked among the best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment, which typically boosts investor confidence. However, the article mentions competition from AI stocks that may outperform Apple in the short term, as well as the company's ranking as fifth among Dow stocks, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, while the fundamentals of Apple are strong, the presence of AI-focused investments and comparisons to other stocks introduce a note of caution. Thus, the probability of rising stock prices remains higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but overall positive outlook for Apple. It acknowledges Apple's solid Q4 2024 performance, driven by iPhone sales and services growth, as well as its strong position in the Dow. However, it consistently suggests that AI stocks might offer higher near-term returns, tempering the enthusiasm for AAPL. AAPL's ranking as the 5th best Dow stock further implies that better opportunities might exist elsewhere. Previous predictions have hovered around 0.6 to 0.7 for a price rise. Considering the AI stock comparison, which is a consistent theme across the article and previous rounds, I will maintain a moderate probability of a price increase but will not increase it from the previous round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While strong Q4 2024 results, including record revenue and growth in services, are positive, the article consistently emphasizes the potential for AI stocks to outperform in the short term.  This comparison is a key factor influencing the overall sentiment. Apple's ranking as a top Dow stock is bullish, but not overwhelmingly so, and the hedge fund interest, while positive, doesn't provide a strong enough signal to outweigh the AI stock narrative.  The previous predictions from various models show a consistent leaning towards a price rise, but with probabilities clustering around 0.6-0.7, indicating considerable uncertainty.  The overall tone is positive but cautious, reflecting the strong fundamentals but acknowledging the potential for higher returns elsewhere in the market.  Considering the strong fundamentals, positive market trends, and the mixed signals in the news itself, a moderate probability of price increase seems appropriate, slightly lower than the average of previous predictions to reflect the persistent emphasis on AI's competitive advantage.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong Q4 2024 performance with record revenue driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment.
