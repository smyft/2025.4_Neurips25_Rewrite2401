(AAPL) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The article presents a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong performance in the fourth quarter with record revenues largely driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. Additionally, AAPL ranks among the best Dow stocks according to hedge fund sentiment, which can positively influence investor perception. While the overall market sentiment is skewed towards AI stocks, the growth in AAPL's infrastructure and robust sales figures suggest that it's a solid investment within the Dow. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising as the favorable news may attract buying interest.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong performance, including revenue growth, especially in iPhones and services, exceeding 1 billion paid memberships. It also mentions Apple's dominance in the consumer electronics sector and its increasing demand in AI, which is generally positive for tech stocks which can drive demand for AAPL's products. Apple is also a leading player in wearable tech. Hedge fund interest in Apple is significant, further suggesting market confidence. On the other hand, the article suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns compared to Apple in the immediate future. Furthermore, the article positions Apple at number 5 on the list of the best Dow stocks to buy, implying other stocks may have greater growth potential. While the article does not contain explicitly negative information, the comparison to AI Stocks and ranking could reduce positive sentiment. Therefore, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a rise in stock price given all the information but not by a wide margin.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple reported record revenue and strong growth in its services sector, the article emphasizes the potential of AI stocks to outperform Apple in the shorter term.  The article ranks Apple 5th out of 12 best Dow stocks to buy now based on hedge fund sentiment, suggesting a positive, but not overwhelmingly bullish, outlook.  The mention of CDT Capital Management's cautious view on the overvaluation of AI stocks, even while acknowledging their potential, introduces a note of uncertainty. Overall, the article highlights Apple's strong performance but doesn't provide compelling reasons for an immediate significant price surge.  The probability of a price rise is therefore tempered by the comparison to other, higher-ranked, AI stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance, including record revenue in Q4 2024, driven by iPhone sales and growth in its services segment. The company's solid position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, coupled with positive market trends in tech stocks due to AI advancements and overall economic optimism, suggests a favorable outlook. However, the article also mentions concerns about 'unhinged' valuations in the tech sector, which could introduce some volatility. Despite this, the overall sentiment appears positive, with AAPL being ranked among the best Dow stocks to buy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now. It highlights the company's strong performance, with record revenue of $94.9 billion in Q4 2024, a 6% rise from the previous year. The article also mentions Apple's dominant position in the consumer electronics sector, its growing services sector, and its high-end ecosystem of goods, services, and software. These factors contribute to a positive sentiment around the stock. However, the article also mentions that the conviction for Apple's growth lies in its potential to keep up with AI-related advancements, but other AI stocks might hold greater promise. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising seems higher than falling, but the article does not provide overwhelmingly positive indicators that would significantly increase the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best Dow stocks to buy right now, highlighting its solid financial performance, dominance in the consumer electronics sector, and growth in its Services business segment. The company's record revenue and strong iPhone sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are also mentioned. However, the article notes that AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, which might impact AAPL's growth potential. Considering the overall positive tone of the article and the current market trends, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong quarterly results and continued dominance in the consumer electronics sector. However, the article suggests a preference for AI stocks over AAPL based on the potential for higher returns in the short term. Despite this, AAPL is ranked fifth among the best Dow stocks to buy, suggesting it still holds significant appeal. The bullish trend in tech stocks and the overall positive economic outlook might support further gains.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
