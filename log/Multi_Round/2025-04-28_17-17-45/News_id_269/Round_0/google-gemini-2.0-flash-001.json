(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\nNews Content: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While TSMC assures quality matching Taiwan's standards, delays in Arizona, where Apple is expected to source chips, could negatively impact Apple's supply chain and potentially delay product launches or increase production costs. The fact that Taiwan will receive priority on the most advanced chip technology also indicates a possible disadvantage for US companies relying on TSMC's Arizona production. However, the CHIPS Act funding attempts to mitigate these issues, providing some balancing effect.
