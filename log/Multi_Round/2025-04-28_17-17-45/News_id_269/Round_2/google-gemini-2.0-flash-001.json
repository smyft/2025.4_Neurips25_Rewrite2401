(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\nNews Content: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily highlights the struggles of TSMC in expanding its operations in Arizona due to U.S. regulations, which could delay the supply of advanced chips crucial for Apple. As TSMC is a significant supplier for Apple, any delays in chip production may negatively impact Apple's product development and sales forecasts. However, TSMC reassured investors about matching Taiwan's quality, which may lessen the immediate concerns. The uncertainty in supply chain issues could lead to a more cautious outlook on Apple's stock. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling may be slightly greater than that of it rising, given the potential supply disruptions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates potential problems for TSMC's Arizona plant due to regulatory hurdles and labor shortages. While TSMC assures quality matching Taiwan's standards, delays in Arizona, where Apple is expected to source chips, could negatively impact Apple's supply chain and potentially delay product launches or increase production costs. The fact that Taiwan will receive priority on the most advanced chip technology also indicates a possible disadvantage for US companies relying on TSMC's Arizona production. However, the CHIPS Act funding attempts to mitigate these issues, providing some balancing effect. GuruFocus identifying warning signs related to TSM adds to the level of concern for investors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on TSMC's difficulties expanding its Arizona plant, citing regulatory hurdles and labor shortages.  While TSMC produces chips for Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is indirect and likely muted. The delays in Arizona primarily affect TSMC's production capacity and timeline, not Apple's immediate operations.  Although there might be a minor negative sentiment associated with potential future supply chain constraints,  Apple's overall financial health and strong brand loyalty are likely to outweigh this relatively small, long-term impact.  The news is more relevant to TSMC's stock than Apple's. Any price movement in Apple would likely be small and short-lived unless further significant supply chain issues are revealed.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights delays in TSMC's Arizona plant due to U.S. permitting issues, labor shortages, and strict construction rules, which could impact the supply chain for Apple (AAPL) as TSMC is a key supplier. However, TSMC's CEO reassured investors about the quality of the Arizona facility, and the CHIPS Act funding provides long-term support. The immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative due to potential supply chain concerns, but not severely negative given TSMC's reassurances and the long-term nature of the project.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by TSMC, a key supplier of chips to Apple Inc. (AAPL), in setting up its Arizona plant due to regulatory and labor issues. Despite these challenges, TSMC reassures that the Arizona facility will match the quality of its Taiwan operations. However, delays in the project could potentially impact the supply chain for Apple, which relies on TSMC for its chips. Given that the news does not directly report negative impacts on Apple but rather on TSMC's operations, the immediate effect on Apple's stock price might be limited. However, investors might be concerned about potential future supply chain disruptions. The probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slightly higher likelihood of a stock price fall due to potential long-term supply concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses delays and challenges faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in its Arizona plant, which is a supplier of chips to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The delays are attributed to slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages.
