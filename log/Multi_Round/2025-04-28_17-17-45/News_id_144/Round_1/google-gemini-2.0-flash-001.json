      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\nNews Content: How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline pertains specifically to investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, which is not directly related to Apple Inc.'s core business operations or performance. Since the information provided doesn't have any significant implications for Apple's stock performance, it is unlikely to cause major movements in either direction. Hence, the probabilities of price movement are quite balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)' is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. VTI is a broad market ETF and while Apple is a component of VTI, the investment advice is unlikely to selectively drive Apple's stock up or down. The news does not mention Apple specifically, nor does it address any fundamentals related to Apple as a company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article is about investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), not about Apple Inc.  Therefore, the news headline and content are completely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this news and would be based on other market factors.  The probabilities are thus assigned assuming no influence from this particular news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is unrelated to Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no direct or indirect mention of Apple Inc. or any factors that could influence its stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have any impact on AAPL's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific information that could influence its stock price. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a broad market ETF that tracks the performance of the overall stock market. Since there is no specific information related to Apple Inc., the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are both low, but given the neutral nature of the news, it's slightly more inclined towards no change or a slight positive market sentiment that could affect all stocks, including AAPL, marginally positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its stock performance. The news is about investing in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is a separate financial instrument. As a result, it's unlikely that this news would have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight leaning towards no change, but since that's not an option, they are split evenly.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news headline provided is specific to how to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which is an ETF and not directly associated with Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is no direct information in the given headline that indicates any impact on Apple's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This has no direct bearing on Apple's specific fundamentals, business operations, or competitive landscape. The consensus from prior rounds strongly supports this view, with most models concluding the news is either irrelevant or has a negligible impact, leading to relatively balanced probability estimates. The extremely pessimistic qwen model is an outlier and doesn't align with the neutral nature of the headine topic. Therefore, a neutral to slightly positive stance seems appropriate, considering a general interest in market investment might indirectly benefit companies within the VTI which includes AAPL.
