While Apple is a major player in consumer electronics and services, its direct involvement and strategic direction concerning the metaverse is important. Given that the metaverse is an emerging sector, there could be an optimistic sentiment among investors about growth potential. However, without specific news indicating that Apple is significantly increasing its investments or making substantial moves in the metaverse, the impact on AAPL's stock price might be neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with considerable room for uncertainty, leading to a modest probability of falling as well.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
