Apple has not been a prominent player in the metaverse space compared to companies like Meta (Facebook). However, Apple's focus on augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) through products like the Apple Vision Pro could indirectly tie it to the metaverse. Given the lack of concrete information in the news, the market reaction is likely to be neutral or slightly positive if investors speculate on Apple's potential in the metaverse. The probability of a rise or fall is balanced but leans slightly positive due to Apple's general market strength and innovation reputation.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
