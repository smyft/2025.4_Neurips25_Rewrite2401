Although the full content of the article is not available, the positive movement of the US benchmark equity indexes suggests a bullish market sentiment. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the US equities market, it is likely that the company's stock price will be positively affected by the overall market trend. However, without more specific information about Apple Inc. or its sector, the probability of the stock price rising or falling cannot be determined with high precision. Based on the general positive market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}"
