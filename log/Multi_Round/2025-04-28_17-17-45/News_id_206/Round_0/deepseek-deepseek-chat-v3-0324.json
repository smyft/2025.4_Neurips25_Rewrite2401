Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of US equity indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and its stock price often moves in tandem with broader market trends. Given the positive market reaction to Trump's inauguration, it is likely that AAPL's stock price could also experience an upward movement. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or any company-specific developments, so the probability of a rise is moderately high but not certain. The probability of a fall is relatively low given the overall positive market sentiment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```"
