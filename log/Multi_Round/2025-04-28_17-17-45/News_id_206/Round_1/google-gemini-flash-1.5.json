A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity markets ended higher following Donald Trump's inauguration, which generally leads to positive sentiment in the markets. Stronger market performance can positively influence individual stocks, including AAPL. Given Apple's historical resilience and its strong market position, the likelihood of its stock price increasing in response to overall market positivity is higher than that of it falling. However, specific factors impacting Apple, such as earnings reports or market sentiment shifts, are not mentioned here, which limits certainty. Overall, I assess a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general positive market trend ('US Equities Markets End Higher'). This suggests a slightly positive influence on most stocks, including Apple. However, the article itself is behind a paywall, so the specific details of Trump's actions (mentioned as 'digested President Donald Trump's initia...') are unknown. Therefore, while a positive market trend usually implies a higher probability of a stock price increase, the lack of specific information about policies impacting Apple limits the strength of this prediction. A small hedge has been kept in place to represent possible negative perception, even if the details aren't available.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline states that US equity markets ended higher on the day Trump took office.  This is a broad market indicator and doesn't offer specific information about Apple's performance or prospects.  While a positive market day often correlates with positive movement in individual stocks, the correlation is not perfect.  Without further details on how the news specifically impacted Apple or its sector, it's impossible to accurately assess the probability of price changes.  Therefore, the probabilities below reflect a neutral stance, assuming the news has a limited, if any, direct impact on Apple's stock price in isolation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher as President Trump took office, suggesting a positive market sentiment. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of US equity indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and its stock price often moves in tandem with broader market trends. Given the positive market reaction to Trump's inauguration, it is likely that AAPL's stock price could also experience an upward movement. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or any company-specific developments, so the probability of a rise is moderately high but not certain. The probability of a fall is relatively low given the overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including benchmark equity indexes, ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. While the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or its stock performance, it suggests a positive overall market trend. Given that Apple's stock is a significant component of major US equity indexes, it is likely that AAPL's stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to Trump's presidency, the probabilities are based on the general market trend described.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the US equities markets ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Donald Trump's initial actions. Although the full content of the article is not available, the positive movement of the US benchmark equity indexes suggests a bullish market sentiment. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the US equities market, it is likely that the company's stock price will be positively affected by the overall market trend. However, without more specific information about Apple Inc. or its sector, the probability of the stock price rising or falling cannot be determined with high precision. Based on the general positive market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a generally positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including those from large multinational companies like Apple Inc. However, without more context on specific impacts on Apple from this news, it is challenging to definitively link the broader market trend directly to Apple's stock performance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While the article details are unavailable, this general positive market sentiment is likely to have a positive correlation with Apple's stock price, given its significant role in the US market. However, the lack of specifics about Trump's actions and their direct impact on Apple introduces uncertainty.  The previous predictions range from 0.5 to 0.7 probability of a rise, with a general consensus leaning toward a higher likelihood of a price increase, though not overwhelmingly so.
