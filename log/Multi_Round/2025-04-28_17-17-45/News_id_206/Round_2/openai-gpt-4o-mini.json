A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity markets ended higher following Donald Trump's inauguration, which generally leads to positive sentiment in the markets. Stronger market performance can positively influence individual stocks, including AAPL. Given Apple's historical resilience and its strong market position, the likelihood of its stock price increasing in response to overall market positivity is higher than that of it falling. However, specific factors impacting Apple, such as earnings reports or market sentiment shifts, are not mentioned here, which limits certainty. Overall, I assess a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general positive market trend ('US Equities Markets End Higher'). This suggests a slightly positive influence on most stocks, including Apple. However, the article itself is behind a paywall, so the specific details of Trump's actions (mentioned as 'digested President Donald Trump's initia...') are unknown. Therefore, while a positive market trend usually implies a higher probability of a stock price increase, the lack of specific information about policies impacting Apple limits the strength of this prediction. A small hedge has been kept in place to represent possible negative perception, even if the details aren't available.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline states that US equity markets ended higher on the day Trump took office.  This is a broad market indicator and doesn't offer specific information about Apple's performance or prospects.  While a positive market day often correlates with positive movement in individual stocks, the correlation is not perfect.  Without further details on how the news specifically impacted Apple or its sector, it's impossible to accurately assess the probability of price changes.  Therefore, the probabilities below reflect a neutral stance, assuming the news has a limited, if any, direct impact on Apple's stock price in isolation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher as President Trump took office, suggesting a positive market sentiment. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of US equity indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and its stock price often moves in tandem with broader market trends. Given the positive market reaction to Trump's inauguration, it is likely that AAPL's stock price could also experience an upward movement. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or any company-specific developments, so the probability of a rise is moderately high but not certain. The probability of a fall is relatively low given the overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including benchmark equity indexes, ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. While the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or its stock performance, it suggests a positive overall market trend. Given that Apple's stock is a significant component of major US equity indexes, it is likely that AAPL's stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to Trump's presidency, the probabilities are based on the general market trend described.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the US equities markets ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Donald Trump's initial actions. Although the full content of the article is not available, the positive movement of the US benchmark equity indexes suggests a bullish market sentiment. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the US equities market, it is likely that the company's stock price will be positively affected by the overall market trend. However, without more specific information about Apple Inc. or its sector, the probability of the stock price rising or falling cannot be determined with high precision. Based on the general positive market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a generally positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including those from large multinational companies like Apple Inc. However, without more context on specific impacts on Apple from this news, it is challenging to definitively link the broader market trend directly to Apple's stock performance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment in the US equities markets following the inauguration of President Trump, which generally correlates with upward movement in major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Historical trends suggest that when the broader market performs well, AAPL is likely to reflect that positivity. Despite the lack of specific information around Apple's performance or sector impacts, the overall favorable market trend suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price rising compared to it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market trend on the day President Trump took office. This could generally boost stock prices, including Apple's. However, the article is behind a paywall, limiting detailed understanding of the specific policies and their potential impact on Apple. All previous rounds hovered around 0.6-0.7 for rising and 0.3-0.4 for falling. Given this consensus and the lack of further negative signals, I'll maintain a slightly positive outlook, but with a bit more caution due to the missing details.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive overall market trend on the day Trump took office.  While the article details are unavailable, this general positive market sentiment is likely to have a positive correlation with Apple's stock price, given its significant role in the US market. However, the lack of specifics about Trump's actions and their direct impact on Apple introduces uncertainty.  The previous predictions range from 0.5 to 0.7 probability of a rise, with a general consensus leaning toward a higher likelihood of a price increase, though not overwhelmingly so.  Considering the limited information and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, a conservative estimate is warranted, acknowledging the potential for the market reaction to be less directly impactful on Apple than initially implied.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in US equity markets following President Donald Trump's inauguration, which generally bodes well for individual stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given Apple's prominence in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, its stock price often correlates with broader market movements. While the news does not provide specific details about Apple's performance or sector-specific impacts, the overall positive market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of a rise, with most estimates between 0.6 and 0.7. Considering this consensus and the general market trend, I estimate a moderately high probability of a price rise, with a lower probability of a fall due to the lack of negative specifics in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive overall market trend, which often correlates with positive movement in individual stocks, including those of major companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple's stock is a significant component of major US equity indexes, it is likely that AAPL's stock price would also experience a positive movement in line with the general market trend. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to Trump's presidency, the probabilities are based on the general market trend described. Considering the general positive sentiment and Apple's historical resilience, a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling is estimated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market trend with US equities markets ending higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a general positive sentiment in the markets, which could influence individual stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the lack of specific details about Apple's performance or direct impact from Trump's actions, the prediction relies on the general market trend. Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive market sentiment. Considering the broad market indicator and the neutral to positive stance of previous predictions, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a generally positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including those from large multinational companies like Apple Inc. There are mixed signals from previous predictions, but the majority seem to lean towards a slight rise in the stock price due to the overall bullish sentiment. Since the provided news headline lacks specific details about Apple\u2019s performance, we must rely on broader market trends, where Apple, being a major component, is likely to benefit.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
