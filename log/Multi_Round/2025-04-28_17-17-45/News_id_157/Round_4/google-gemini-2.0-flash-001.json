(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a warning from Ray Dalio about high valuations in leading stocks, including those in the Magnificent Seven, which Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a part of. Dalio's concerns about rising interest rates and the current economic environment may lead to decreased investor confidence in expensive stocks, making a pullback more likely. Goldman Sachs also mentioned that stocks are 'priced for perfection', which aligns with Dalio's viewpoint. Given these considerations, there is a greater probability that the stock price of AAPL will fall rather than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook on leading stocks, including those often associated with Apple (though Apple isn't directly called out as 'expensive' like Nvidia and Amazon are). Ray Dalio's warning about 'expensive' leading stocks and the potential negative impact of rising interest rates suggests a possible downturn. While Dalio's past predictions have not always been accurate, his concerns about US debt and potential market rotation could lead investors to re-evaluate their portfolios and potentially reduce exposure to stocks perceived as overvalued. Factors like rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars further contribute to market uncertainty. The article also mentions that stocks are 'priced for perfection'. Taken together, this information suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could partially offset these negative sentiments, so the probability of a decline is not overwhelmingly high. The news article also mentions other stories, which suggest further negativity in the markets.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Ray Dalio, a prominent billionaire investor, expresses concern about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple, citing potential negative impacts from rising interest rates.  He highlights the 'Magnificent Seven' group, of which Apple is a member, as being particularly expensive.  While Dalio doesn't explicitly predict a fall in Apple's share price, his comments suggest a negative outlook for these high-growth stocks in a rising interest rate environment.  The overall market sentiment is also cautious due to concerns about US debt, inflation, and potential trade wars.  These factors create an environment where a stock price decline is more likely than a rise, although Apple's strong fundamentals could mitigate the negative impact to some degree.  The probabilities are subjective estimations based on interpreting Dalio's comments and the overall market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights concerns from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the stock prices of major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), being overvalued. Dalio specifically mentions that the Magnificent Seven stocks, which include AAPL, are 'so expensive' and warns that rising interest rates could negatively impact these high-momentum stocks. Additionally, the article points to broader macroeconomic concerns such as the U.S. debt situation, rising bond yields, and potential policy uncertainties. Given Dalio's credibility and the bearish sentiment expressed, along with the broader market concerns, this news is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment toward AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio expressed concerns that the leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are expensive and could be hit hard if the 10-year yield continues to rise. He emphasized the importance of diversification and warned that being systematically leveraged long in a rising interest rate environment is not likely to be good. Given that AAPL is one of the top-momentum names and part of the 'Magnificent Seven', Dalio's comments could negatively impact investor sentiment towards the stock. However, it's worth noting that Dalio's views are not always immediate predictors of stock performance, and market reactions can be delayed or influenced by various factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline states that billionaire investor Ray Dalio believes stock prices, particularly those of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies including Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon, are expensive and inflated. Dalio warns that if the 10-year yield continues to rise, these top-momentum names could be hit hard. This warning, combined with Dalio's concerns over the US debt situation and the potential for a rise in interest rates, suggests a negative outlook for the stock prices of these companies. Therefore, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Ray Dalio's concern that current market valuations, including those of leading stocks like Apple (AAPL), are expensive and vulnerable to interest rate rises. This could lead to investor rotation out of these top-momentum names towards more defensive assets. While the recent performance and recovery from the pandemic have been strong, Dalio's perspective on high inflation, rising treasury yields, and the potential negative impact on expensive stocks increases the risk for a downward trend.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news discusses concerns raised by billionaire investor Ray Dalio regarding the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as part of the 'Magnificent Seven'. Dalio warns that if rising interest rates persist, these high-momentum stocks, including Apple, could face significant downward pressure. Coupled with broader macroeconomic uncertainties such as U.S. debt concerns, rising bond yields, and the concept of stocks being 'priced for perfection', there is a prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding Apple. This aligns with previous predictions indicating a stronger probability of a price decline. While Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the external pressures articulated in the news suggest a higher likelihood of a drop in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The general consensus from the previous rounds is bearish, with probabilities favoring a stock price decline. The primary driver is Ray Dalio's warning about overvalued leading stocks like Apple and their vulnerability to rising interest rates. While Dalio's predictions don't always pan out, his views, coupled with concerns about US debt and market uncertainty, contribute to the negative sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple's fundamentals and brand could offer some resilience. Given the consistent predictions in previous rounds and the continuing presence of the core concerns highlighted, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a fall, since all the information from previous rounds is still relevant, and there's no new information to shift the probabilities. Given the amount of negative information, the probability of stock prices falling should remain high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: Ray Dalio's statement regarding the overvaluation of leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven' which Apple is a part of, is the primary driver of this analysis.  His concern about rising interest rates further exacerbates the risk of a price decline.  The consensus of the previous models leans heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall (averaging around 0.7).  While Apple's strong fundamentals could offer some resilience, the weight of Dalio's opinion, combined with broader market anxieties about US debt and potential trade wars, suggests a heightened likelihood of a short-term negative impact on the stock price.  The fact that Apple isn't directly named as 'expensive' by Dalio might slightly mitigate the negative impact, compared to other companies explicitly called out. However, the general sentiment of overvaluation for top-performing tech companies remains a significant factor. Considering these elements and the previous predictions, a probability slightly higher than the average previous prediction of decline is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as highlighted by billionaire investor Ray Dalio. Dalio warns that these stocks are 'so expensive' and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates, high inflation, and broader macroeconomic concerns such as US debt levels. His remarks, combined with the cautionary tone from Goldman Sachs about stocks being 'priced for perfection,' suggest a heightened risk of market rotation away from overvalued stocks. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty might offer some resilience, the overall sentiment and Dalio's credibility create a negative short-term outlook for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook on leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Dalio's concerns about US debt, potential market rotation, and the overall economic environment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could partially offset these negative sentiments, the consensus from multiple sources indicates a higher likelihood of a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights concerns from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the stock prices of major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), being overvalued. Dalio specifically mentions that the Magnificent Seven stocks, which include AAPL, are 'so expensive' and warns that rising interest rates could negatively impact these high-momentum stocks. Additionally, the article points to broader macroeconomic concerns such as the U.S. debt situation, rising bond yields, and potential policy uncertainties. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which range from 0.25 to 0.35 for the probability of the stock price rising and 0.65 to 0.75 for the probability of the stock price falling, I will take a conservative approach and estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.3 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.7, given the overall bearish sentiment expressed by Dalio and the broader market concerns.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis indicates a strong consensus among various models that the recent comments from Ray Dalio present a bearish outlook for expensive stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Dalio's concerns about high valuations, rising interest rates, and broader economic issues such as US debt contribute to the prevailing negative sentiment. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' which Dalio stated are particularly expensive, and considering that multiple models predict a likelihood of stock price decline, I conclude that the probability of AAPL's stock price falling is significantly high.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.27, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.73, Reasoning: The prevailing sentiment from previous rounds leans heavily towards a decrease in Apple's stock price, driven predominantly by Ray Dalio's concerns about overvaluation within the 'Magnificent Seven'. His warnings are further amplified by anxieties surrounding rising interest rates and macroeconomic factors. While Apple's robust foundations may provide some buffer, the consistent negative outlook warrants adjusting the probabilities slightly. Additionally, the recent failure of qwen/qwen-turbo model may indicate some subtle underlying concerns. Given the consistent predictions in previous rounds and the recent data, the probability of a stock price falling should remain fairly high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Ray Dalio's statement carries significant weight due to his prominence in the investment world. His concerns about overvalued leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven' group where Apple resides, combined with worries about rising interest rates, paint a bearish picture.  The consistent bearish sentiment expressed by various AI models in previous rounds further reinforces this negative outlook.  While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could offer some resilience, the prevailing market anxieties regarding US debt, potential trade wars, and the general sense that stocks are 'priced for perfection' suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decline.  The fact that Apple isn't explicitly named as 'expensive' by Dalio, unlike some others, might slightly lessen the immediate impact compared to other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, but the overall negative sentiment still significantly influences the probability estimates.  Considering the combined weight of Dalio's opinion and the prior predictions, a probability weighted towards a price decline is appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as highlighted by billionaire investor Ray Dalio. Dalio warns that these stocks are 'so expensive' and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates, high inflation, and broader macroeconomic concerns such as US debt levels. His remarks, combined with the cautionary tone from Goldman Sachs about stocks being 'priced for perfection,' suggest a heightened risk of market rotation away from overvalued stocks. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty might offer some resilience, the overall sentiment and Dalio's credibility create a negative short-term outlook for AAPL's stock price. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which largely favor a decline, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook on leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Dalio's concerns about US debt, potential market rotation, and the overall economic environment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could partially offset these negative sentiments, the consensus from multiple sources indicates a higher likelihood of a decline. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which range from 0.25 to 0.35 for the probability of the stock price rising and 0.65 to 0.75 for the probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.28 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.72.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), as billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Dalio's concerns about US debt, potential market rotation, and the overall economic environment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise. Additionally, previous predictions from other models consistently indicate a higher likelihood of a decline, with probabilities of a fall ranging from 0.65 to 0.75. Considering the overall sentiment and the consensus from multiple sources, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling as 0.72 and the probability of the stock price rising as 0.28.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Ray Dalio's concerns about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple Inc., suggesting they are priced for perfection and vulnerable to rising interest rates and broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Previous rounds of predictions consistently indicate a bearish sentiment toward these stocks. Although Apple's strong fundamentals could provide some resilience, the overall market sentiment remains negative. Given the consistency in bearish trends and the lack of any new information to shift the probabilities, the estimated probabilities follow suit, predicting a higher likelihood of stock price decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant concerns raised by billionaire investor Ray Dalio regarding the valuations of leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). His comments on the 'Magnificent Seven' suggest that these stocks are overpriced and vulnerable to potential declines, especially in the context of rising interest rates and broader macroeconomic uncertainties like US debt. The consensus from previous rounds of predictions leans heavily toward a bearish sentiment, reflecting a high probability of AAPL's stock price falling. Although Apple's fundamentals and strong brand may provide some degree of resilience, the overarching sentiment from Dalio's statements and market conditions indicate a greater likelihood for a price decrease than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The consistently bearish sentiment stemming from Ray Dalio's comments regarding overvalued leading stocks, particularly Apple as part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' heavily influences this prediction. His worries, coupled with anxieties surrounding rising interest rates, US debt, and a 'priced for perfection' market, suggest a significant downside risk. While Apple's robust fundamentals may offer limited support, the strong consensus across all previous rounds indicates a high likelihood of a price decline. No new positive information has emerged to counteract this negative outlook; therefore, the prediction weights heavily toward a fall in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news features Ray Dalio, a prominent investor, expressing concern about the high valuations of leading stocks, including those in the 'Magnificent Seven' group, of which Apple is a member.  Dalio's warning, coupled with concerns about rising interest rates and broader macroeconomic uncertainties (U.S. debt, potential trade wars), points towards a bearish outlook for Apple.  The consistent bearish sentiment expressed across multiple AI models in previous rounds further reinforces this negative outlook.  While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could offer some resilience, the weight of Dalio's opinion and the prevailing market anxieties significantly influence the probability estimates.  The lack of any significantly positive countervailing news suggests a continuation of the bearish trend observed in prior predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The financial news presents a bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, with billionaire investor Ray Dalio warning about their high valuations and vulnerability to rising interest rates. Dalio's concerns, combined with broader macroeconomic uncertainties such as US debt levels and potential trade wars, suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. While Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could offer some resilience, the overall sentiment and previous predictions from multiple models consistently favor a higher probability of a price fall. Given the consensus and the prevailing negative sentiment, the probability of a stock price decline is estimated to be significantly higher than that of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook on leading stocks, including Apple Inc.
