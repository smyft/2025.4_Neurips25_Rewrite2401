(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a warning from Ray Dalio about high valuations in leading stocks, including those in the Magnificent Seven, which Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a part of. Dalio's concerns about rising interest rates and the current economic environment may lead to decreased investor confidence in expensive stocks, making a pullback more likely. Goldman Sachs also mentioned that stocks are 'priced for perfection', which aligns with Dalio's viewpoint. Given these considerations, there is a greater probability that the stock price of AAPL will fall rather than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a bearish outlook on leading stocks, including those often associated with Apple (though Apple isn't directly called out as 'expensive' like Nvidia and Amazon are). Ray Dalio's warning about 'expensive' leading stocks and the potential negative impact of rising interest rates suggests a possible downturn. While Dalio's past predictions have not always been accurate, his concerns about US debt and potential market rotation could lead investors to re-evaluate their portfolios and potentially reduce exposure to stocks perceived as overvalued. Factors like rising bond yields, a strong dollar, and potential trade wars further contribute to market uncertainty. The article also mentions that stocks are 'priced for perfection'. Taken together, this information suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could partially offset these negative sentiments, so the probability of a decline is not overwhelmingly high. The news article also mentions other stories, which suggest further negativity in the markets.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Ray Dalio, a prominent billionaire investor, expresses concern about the high valuations of leading stocks, including Apple, citing potential negative impacts from rising interest rates.  He highlights the 'Magnificent Seven' group, of which Apple is a member, as being particularly expensive.  While Dalio doesn't explicitly predict a fall in Apple's share price, his comments suggest a negative outlook for these high-growth stocks in a rising interest rate environment.  The overall market sentiment is also cautious due to concerns about US debt, inflation, and potential trade wars.  These factors create an environment where a stock price decline is more likely than a rise, although Apple's strong fundamentals could mitigate the negative impact to some degree.  The probabilities are subjective estimations based on interpreting Dalio's comments and the overall market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights concerns from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the stock prices of major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), being overvalued. Dalio specifically mentions that the Magnificent Seven stocks, which include AAPL, are 'so expensive' and warns that rising interest rates could negatively impact these high-momentum stocks. Additionally, the article points to broader macroeconomic concerns such as the U.S. debt situation, rising bond yields, and potential policy uncertainties. Given Dalio's credibility and the bearish sentiment expressed, along with the broader market concerns, this news is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment toward AAPL in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio expressed concerns that the leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are expensive and could be hit hard if the 10-year yield continues to rise. He emphasized the importance of diversification and warned that being systematically leveraged long in a rising interest rate environment is not likely to be good. Given that AAPL is one of the top-momentum names and part of the 'Magnificent Seven', Dalio's comments could negatively impact investor sentiment towards the stock. However, it's worth noting that Dalio's views are not always immediate predictors of stock performance, and market reactions can be delayed or influenced by various factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline states that billionaire investor Ray Dalio believes stock prices, particularly those of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies including Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon, are expensive and inflated. Dalio warns that if the 10-year yield continues to rise, these top-momentum names could be hit hard. This warning, combined with Dalio's concerns over the US debt situation and the potential for a rise in interest rates, suggests a negative outlook for the stock prices of these companies. Therefore, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Ray Dalio's concern that current market valuations, including those of leading stocks like Apple (AAPL), are expensive and vulnerable to interest rate rises. This could lead to investor rotation out of these top-momentum names towards more defensive assets. While the recent performance and recovery from the pandemic have been strong, Dalio's perspective on high inflation, rising treasury yields, and the potential negative impact on expensive stocks increases the risk for a downward trend.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

His concern about rising interest rates further exacerbates the risk of a price decline.  The consensus of the previous models leans heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall (averaging around 0.7).  While Apple's strong fundamentals could offer some resilience, the weight of Dalio's opinion, combined with broader market anxieties about US debt and potential trade wars, suggests a heightened likelihood of a short-term negative impact on the stock price.  The fact that Apple isn't directly named as 'expensive' by Dalio might slightly mitigate the negative impact, compared to other companies explicitly called out. However, the general sentiment of overvaluation for top-performing tech companies remains a significant factor. Considering these elements and the previous predictions, a probability slightly higher than the average previous prediction of decline is assigned.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.28,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.72\n}\n```\n"
