(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Labour installs Amazon man at CMA as Trump threatens tech war\nNews Content: Doug Gurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022 - Shutterstock\n\nThe chairman of Britain\u2019s competition regulator has been ousted and replaced with a veteran Amazon executive as Donald Trump threatens a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants.\n\nMinisters last night appointed Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022, as interim chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nHe will replace Marcus Bokkerink, who is leaving just three years into a five-year term at the watchdog, after an intervention from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary.\n\nIt is understood his exit is intended to signal that the Government is serious about its efforts to unlock growth, as the CMA has in recent years been attacked for attempting to halt a wide range of deals.\n\nThis includes an effort to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a356bn) takeover of gaming company Activision in 2023, which led to the former\u2019s boss Brad Smith claiming his confidence in the UK had been left \u201cseverely shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, under Mr Gurr, Amazon accused the CMA of a \u201cspeculative\u201d effort to block a minority investment in the UK\u2019s Deliveroo in 2018.\n\nFive years later, Will Shu, Deliveroo chief executive, claimed the watchdog was \u201ctrying to kill companies\u201d.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink, a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, could serve to \u201creassure\u201d the technology sector and say \u201cwe\u2019re taking growth seriously\u201d.\n\nHowever, they also pointed to the fact that Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, has ultimate day-to-day responsibility for the regulator, raising questions over how she will collaborate with Mr Gurr.Sarah Cardell will retain overall responsibility for running the CMA - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nClash with White House\n\nThe unexpected departure of Mr Bokkerink comes as Britain risks a clash with Mr Trump\u2019s new White House regime over its stance on global competition rules.\n\nThe CMA has already announced an investigation into Google over its search dominance this year, while The Telegraph understands it also has been preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores.\n\nMarc Andreessen, who donated to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, last week said there were \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the UK on competition rules, claiming they were \u201cextremely draconian, anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies\u201d.\n\nBrussels regulators have reportedly put major decisions on investigations into Apple, Meta and Google on hold \u2013 in part to assess the temperature of the Trump administration.\n\nCristina Caffarra, a competition economist, said: \u201cIf anyone tried anything that had the potential to make real change, we now know there would be unknown retribution as Trump has indicated he would protect American platforms from Europe, and they bent the knee.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThere were four men [Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai] in the front row [at Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration] worth nearly a trillion dollars, it\u2019s very clear he will protect them in some way.\u201dTech bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration - Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that Labour\u2019s decision to appoint Mr Gurr in the name of growth \u201cseems odd when they are simultaneously appointing their trade union and party donors elsewhere\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as the Government faces calls to refer the attempted takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi fund to the CMA as a breach of legislation banning foreign state ownership of newspapers.\n\nAn investigation of the potential threat to press freedom was paused last year to allow RedBird IMI, which had acquired an option on ownership, to secure an onward sale.\n\nThe process has failed to deliver a transaction, chiefly owing to Abu Dhabi\u2019s price expectations, and RedBird IMI recently urged Telegraph executives to make job cuts and abandon editorial investments prompting a demand for action this week from Sir Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader.\n\nHe accused the Government of \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to upset the UAE.\u201d\n\nA request for the CMA to complete the investigation could allow Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, to order The Telegraph\u2019s independent directors to sell the company at a market price to any acceptable buyer.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink. A government spokesman declined to comment. The CMA was contacted for comment.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a change in leadership at the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive. This could indicate a more favorable environment for tech firms like Apple, potentially leading to less stringent regulations. However, the context of Trump's threat of a tech war and ongoing investigations into major tech firms, including Apple, introduces uncertainty. The overall narrative suggests a modest potential for positive sentiment towards Apple due to the leadership change, yet the potential for regulatory scrutiny still looms. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a slight inclination towards a rise, but with notable risk of a fall due to external pressures and regulatory concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the appointment of Doug Gurr, an Amazon executive, to head the CMA, coupled with the broader shift towards prioritizing growth, suggests a potentially more lenient regulatory environment for Apple and other tech giants in the UK. This is reinforced by Trump's potential trade war against countries seeking to curb US tech companies, and the halt of some EU investigations into companies like Apple pending Trump administration assessment. A less aggressive regulatory landscape could be seen as positive. On the other hand, the CMA is reportedly preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores. This investigation creates uncertainty. Additionally, political considerations surrounding the Labour party and their appointees introduce another layer of complexity. Overall, the risk from the probe is only partially offset by the benefit from the new CMA head, as the news story explicitly states that Sarah Cardell retains overall authority for running the CMA. I will err on the side of caution here.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on a change in leadership at the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and potential trade conflicts between the US and the UK.  While the appointment of an Amazon executive may initially suggest a more lenient approach to tech regulation, this is countered by Trump's threatened tech war and the CMA's ongoing investigation preparations into Apple's app store practices.  The uncertainty surrounding these potential regulatory actions creates considerable ambiguity regarding Apple's stock price. While a more business-friendly CMA *could*  be slightly positive for Apple in the long run, the Trump administration's potential retaliatory measures pose a significant risk, outweighing any potential positive impact of the CMA change. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher than that of a rise, though the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term given the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), signaling a potential shift towards a more pro-growth and possibly less stringent regulatory stance towards US tech giants. This could be seen as favorable for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it might reduce regulatory pressures in the UK. However, the mention of ongoing and potential future investigations into Apple's practices, especially regarding smartphone app stores, introduces uncertainty. The overall impact appears mixed, with some positive sentiment from reduced regulatory hostility but lingering concerns over specific investigations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and its potential implications for tech giants including Apple. The CMA has been investigating Google and is preparing a probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores. The article also mentions a potential clash with the Trump administration over competition rules, which could affect US tech companies. However, the news is more directly related to Amazon and Google than Apple. The impact on Apple seems indirect, and the overall sentiment does not strongly suggest a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a minor negative impact due to increased regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the appointment of a new chairman at the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive. This appointment is seen as a move to reassure the tech sector and promote growth. However, the article also mentions that the CMA has been preparing an investigation into Apple and Google's dominance over smartphone app stores. Given that Apple is one of the companies being investigated, this news could be seen as negative for the company. Additionally, the article mentions Donald Trump's threats of a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants, which could also have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Overall, the news is more likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price than a positive one.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The appointment of a former Amazon executive as the interim head of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) might signal a potential shift in the regulatory landscape towards being less restrictive for tech companies. This change could positively influence investor sentiment about regulatory pressures, particularly if similar shifts occur in other jurisdictions. Conversely, the ongoing threats from Donald Trump regarding a tech war and the mention of Google and Apple potentially facing further scrutiny can raise concerns about future regulatory actions against these companies. The balance between these conflicting factors points towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
