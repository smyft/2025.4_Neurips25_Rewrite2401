(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and diminished innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock is trading near a four-month low, indicating weak investor sentiment. The options market suggests a possible price movement of 4.6% either way, but given the context of negative forecasts and the company's historical price reaction to earnings reports, the likelihood of a price decline is significantly higher. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a stronger chance of a price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The article suggests caution due to potential headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article refers to the company being in a precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market. Analyst estimates have also been revised downwards. However, the article also mentions some positive expectations from Q1 earnings print, analysts expect EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. The article suggests that there's potential for both upward and downward movement but considering the potential headwinds, analyst views, and previous quarterly reports, a decrease in stock price is more likely than an increase. The overall economic and broader market context, including the Fed's decisions and PCE data, will also affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates.  While the overall market environment (Fed meeting, inflation data) is acknowledged as potentially volatile, the article's specific focus on Apple's perceived weaknesses and Meta's perceived strengths heavily influences the probability assessments. The probability of a price rise for AAPL is low given the significant headwinds mentioned, while a price fall appears more likely.  The opposite holds true for META, though market volatility introduces uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several headwinds for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and concerns about its slower adoption of AI. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading at a significant premium according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models. The upcoming earnings report is expected to show muted growth, and the options market anticipates a possible 4.6% move in either direction. Given these factors, the likelihood of the stock price falling appears higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a stock to approach with caution due to headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article highlights that 11 out of 17 analysts lowered their revenue forecasts for Apple in the last 90 days, and there are concerns about Apple's growth trajectory, slower adoption of AI, and potential disappointment in the company's guidance for the current quarter. Additionally, Apple's stock has been underperforming, down 11% to start the new year, and is considered extremely overvalued with a potential downside of -15.5%. These factors contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Apple. Meta Platforms is expected to deliver strong earnings growth driven by its AI efforts and expanding user base, making it a stock to buy. In contrast, Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution. Based on this analysis, the probability of Meta Platforms' stock price rising is higher than Apple's. However, since the question is about Apple, the estimated probability of its stock price falling is higher due to the concerns over iPhone demand and slower adoption of AI.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news mentions potential headwinds due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, which could impact investor confidence negatively. On the other hand, no specific negative news impacting immediate quarterly performance is mentioned. Given the stock's recent underperformance and current market sentiment, it seems to be a cautious period for the company.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates significant challenges for Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly concerning slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have downgraded revenue forecasts, reflecting declining confidence in the company's growth prospects. The expected earnings report is anticipated to show muted growth, and the stock is trading near a four-month low, which compounds negative sentiment. The options market suggests a potential price movement of about 4.6%, but the overall analysis leans toward a bearish outlook given the headwinds outlined. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is considerably higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling due to concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation in AI, lowered revenue forecasts by analysts, and the stock being potentially overvalued. The general market sentiment and Apple's recent underperformance further solidify this bearish outlook. The article highlights specific headwinds and concerns regarding future guidance, reinforcing the likelihood of a price decline. Therefore, this round retains a similar bearish outlook but with a slight adjustment to reflect a marginal possibility of an unexpected positive catalyst, even though the prevailing negative sentiment dominates.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  Slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, particularly concerning AI, and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter are significant headwinds.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the stock is considered overvalued. While the options market suggests a 4.6% move in either direction, the weight of negative factors and historical price reactions to earnings reports points toward a higher probability of a price decline.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Considering this collective assessment, and the lack of strong countervailing positive factors in the provided news, I assign higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to several factors: slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, particularly in AI, and downward revisions in revenue forecasts by analysts. The stock has already underperformed, down 11% year-to-date, and is considered overvalued with a potential downside of 15.5%. The upcoming earnings report is anticipated to be weak, with muted guidance expected. The options market suggests a possible 4.6% move in either direction, but given the negative sentiment and historical reaction to earnings, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a cautious outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock has underperformed recently, trading near a four-month low. The options market suggests a possible 4.6% move in either direction. Given these factors, the likelihood of the stock price falling appears higher than it rising. However, the overall market environment, including the Fed meeting and PCE data, may also influence the stock price. Considering the negative forecasts and the company's historical price reaction to earnings reports, the probability of a price decline is significantly higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling, the overall analysis suggests that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. The mixed market environment, including the Fed meeting and inflation data, adds to the uncertainty but does not significantly alter the bearish outlook for Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., including slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, particularly concerning AI adoption. Multiple analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and Apple's stock has shown underperformance, with a significant downside potential identified by InvestingPro's Fair Value models. While the options market suggests a possible 4.6% move in either direction, the overall negative context, including downward-revised analyst expectations and concerns about earnings, indicates a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
