(AAPL)\nNews Headline: My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One\nNews Content: Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It highlights the resilience of Apple's services segment and the significant return on investment since 2018. Overall, the emphasis on long-term investment and Apple's continued success makes a favorable stock price movement more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses an investor's largest portfolio holdings, emphasizing long-term buy-and-hold strategies and highlighting the success of companies like Nvidia, Netflix, MercadoLibre, Apple, and The Trade Desk. While the article paints a positive picture of Apple's resilience and past performance, particularly its services segment and continued dominance in the smartphone market, it also acknowledges concerns about slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainty. The article explicitly states Apple's stock has surged since 2008 and has yielded 350% since 2018, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. The overall tone towards Apple is bullish, suggesting confidence in continued success. This type of article typically has a slightly positive effect on the company's stock price. Given the recent earnings report and the article's bullish tone, the analysis leans towards a slightly higher probability of a stock price increase than decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article is an opinion piece from an individual investor detailing their portfolio holdings and the reasoning behind their investment choices.  The article mentions Apple as one of their top five holdings. While it expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the strong performance of its services segment, this is not new information to the market. The fact that the investor held Apple for a long time and gained significant returns does not provide any insight into the future stock price movement. The news does not contain any material new information that would affect Apple's stock price significantly. Therefore, the probabilities of a price increase or decrease are largely driven by broader market forces and Apple's future performance, not directly influenced by this particular article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective analysis of the author's top portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the long-term success of these investments. For Apple specifically, the article emphasizes its resilience, the growth of its services segment, and its dominant position in the smartphone market despite slowing iPhone sales. The author's positive sentiment and long-term holding strategy suggest a bullish outlook for Apple. However, the article does not introduce any new, immediate catalysts for Apple's stock price movement. Therefore, while the historical performance and positive narrative may instill investor confidence, the lack of new information limits the immediate impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's largest portfolio holdings and the important investing lessons learned from each one. The article mentions Apple Inc. as one of the holdings and highlights the company's resilience and growth potential. The author notes that despite challenges, Apple's services segment has generated growth in each of the past four years, and the company remains the world's most valuable company. The article also emphasizes the importance of long-term investing and holding onto stocks through market fluctuations. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price of Apple Inc. will rise due to the positive outlook and growth potential mentioned in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the long-term performance and key factors supporting each company's continued success. Regarding Apple, the article emphasizes its resilience and leadership in various segments despite economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. The article does not present specific news about Apple that would directly impact its stock price in the near term, but it reinforces the company's strong historical performance and potential for future growth.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the long-term success and resilience of Apple Inc., emphasizing its market position and growth in the services segment despite slowing iPhone sales. Multiple analyses show a consensus on a bullish outlook for Apple's stock, with several previous predictions leaning towards a higher probability of an increase. The article emphasizes the importance of long-term investment strategies, which aligns with the positive sentiment surrounding Apple's historical performance and future potential. While there are challenges mentioned, the overall narrative supports a favorable view of Apple, justifying a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple as a long-term holding of an individual investor, highlighting its resilience, growth in services, and market leadership. The overall tone is positive, emphasizing past gains (4,120% since 2008; 350% since 2018) and future potential. While it acknowledges slowing iPhone sales and economic concerns, it emphasizes Apple's strengths. Given the sentiment and highlighting of past and potential future returns, a slight positive tilt is anticipated, which corroborates with previous predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article is a personal account of an investor's portfolio holdings, not a factual news report containing new market-moving information about Apple. While the article expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and the success of its services segment, this is largely reiteration of already publicly available information and does not offer any new insights into future performance.  The author's long-term positive experience with Apple stock is anecdotal and does not predict future price movements. Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this specific news article is considered very low. The influence on Apple's stock price will primarily come from broader market factors and future company performance announcements, rather than this retrospective investor opinion.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article is an opinion piece detailing an investor's portfolio holdings, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of the highlighted companies. The tone towards Apple is positive, emphasizing its resilience, dominance in the smartphone market, and the growth of its services segment. The author's long-term holding strategy and significant past returns from Apple suggest a bullish outlook. However, the article does not introduce any new, immediate catalysts or negative information that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. Given the positive sentiment and historical performance, but lack of new material information, the stock price is more likely to experience a modest rise rather than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a positive outlook on Apple Inc., highlighting its sustained dominance in the market, the resilience of its services segment, and its significant return on investment since 2018. Despite acknowledging challenges such as slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainty, the overall tone is bullish, suggesting confidence in continued success. The historical performance and positive narrative may instill investor confidence, although the article does not introduce any new, immediate catalysts for Apple's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's largest portfolio holdings, including Apple Inc., and highlights the company's resilience and growth potential. The article emphasizes the importance of long-term investing and holding onto stocks through market fluctuations. While the article does not present specific new information about Apple, it reinforces the company's strong historical performance and potential for future growth. Considering the positive outlook and the lack of negative information, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. The previous predictions from other models also suggest a bullish outlook for Apple, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's continued dominance and resilience in the market, particularly emphasizing its services segment and the growth despite challenges with iPhone sales and economic uncertainties. Multiple models predict a higher probability of a stock price rise based on the positive sentiments and historical performance. While the article lacks immediate new information, it reinforces the company's strong performance and future growth potential.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's sustained market dominance and the growth of its services segment, highlighting significant past performance despite challenges like slowing iPhone sales and economic uncertainties. The overall tone of the article is positive, reinforcing confidence in Apple's resilience and potential for future growth. Most predictions from previous analyses indicate a bullish outlook, with many models suggesting a higher likelihood of a price rise than a fall. Thus, I estimate a strong probability for a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news article focuses on an investor's long-term portfolio holdings, with Apple being a significant component. While the piece acknowledges challenges like slowing iPhone sales, it prominently features Apple's resilience, the growth of its services segment, and its substantial historical returns. The overall sentiment is clearly bullish. The previous round of predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. This is likely to encourage investor confidence. Therefore the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling. The news mainly reaffirms pre-existing information in the market, it might not have a huge impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a personal account of an investor's successful long-term holdings, including Apple. While the article expresses positive sentiment towards Apple, highlighting its resilience and strong services segment, it does not contain any material new information likely to significantly impact the stock price.  The positive sentiment is largely a reiteration of publicly known information about Apple's market position and performance.  The past performance of Apple cited in the article is already factored into the current stock price.  The probabilities are therefore heavily influenced by broader market forces and future Apple announcements, rather than this specific article.  Considering the previous rounds of predictions show a gradual increase in the predicted probability of a price rise, suggesting some consensus towards a mildly positive outlook, this prediction incorporates a degree of this consensus, but remains relatively neutral due to the lack of new information in this piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article provides a retrospective analysis of an investor's portfolio, with Apple Inc.
