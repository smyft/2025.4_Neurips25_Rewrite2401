(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TSMC\u2019s Upbeat Outlook Fuels Hopes for 2025 AI Spending\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?
