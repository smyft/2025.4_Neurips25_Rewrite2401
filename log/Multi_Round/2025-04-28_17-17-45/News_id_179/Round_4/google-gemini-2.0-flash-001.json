(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news suggests that Jim Cramer believes Apple Inc. will miss upcoming earnings due to declining demand, particularly from China, and has doubts about the effectiveness of AI innovations. This negative outlook, especially from a well-known financial commentator like Cramer, is likely to influence investor sentiment unfavorably. Given that Cramer asserts that the market is not fully aware of the bad news and implies that a significant drop in stock performance is expected, the probabilities should lean toward a decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline is explicitly negative, stating that Jim Cramer anticipates Apple missing earnings. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's AI innovation, his primary concern revolves around lowered guidance and declining China orders which are significant revenue drivers for Apple. He is quoted saying that 'Apple's gonna miss big' indicating strong bearish sentiment. Although the article mentions other topics such as President Trump, DOGE, and TikTok and their potential effects on the markets/tech industry, the overwhelming majority of the content concerning Apple specifically leans towards potential underperformance hence driving down future stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing weakening China orders and AI initiatives not delivering expected results.  While Cramer acknowledges Apple's AI innovation, his negative earnings prediction carries significant weight due to his prominence as a financial commentator.  The article also highlights a general market sentiment suggesting Apple's performance will be worse than anticipated.  However, the article lacks concrete numerical data to support these assertions.  Therefore, while Cramer's prediction increases the likelihood of a price fall,  the lack of supporting evidence makes it less certain than a purely negative outlook. The probability of a price rise is factored in as some investors might see this as a 'buy the dip' opportunity.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically his belief that the company will miss its upcoming earnings despite its AI innovations. Cramer cites weak China orders and general market skepticism as key reasons for his negative stance. Given Cramer's influence and the negative sentiment around earnings, this news is likely to weigh on investor confidence in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand and long-term potential in AI could mitigate some of the downside. The overall tone of the news is negative, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings due to factors such as plummeting China orders and AI not working as expected is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment. This negative outlook could lead to a decrease in stock price. However, it's worth noting that Apple's strong brand and historical performance might cushion the fall or even lead to a rise if investors disagree with Cramer's assessment. Based on the information provided, it seems that the negative comments have a higher likelihood of affecting the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings despite its AI innovation. Cramer's statement is based on his belief that the company's guidance is not sufficient and that China orders have plummeted. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial expert may impact investor confidence and lead to a decrease in the stock price. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in the potential earnings miss, which could limit the downside. Additionally, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may help mitigate the impact of a potential earnings miss. Overall, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns related to China orders and AI innovations, suggesting current headwinds in the market. Given Cramer's credibility and historical accuracy in calling out such predictions, the market may react negatively to these statements, potentially leading to a decline in stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), predicting that the company will miss earnings due to declining orders from China and concerns over AI innovations. Cramer is a well-known financial commentator, and his negative prediction is likely to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Multiple analyses indicate a strong consensus on the negative outlook, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, the lack of specific numerical data and Apple's strong brand presence suggests that some investors may perceive this as a potential buying opportunity, which slightly buffers the potential drop. Overall, the evidence points toward a greater likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consensus from the previous round leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to Jim Cramer's prediction of missed earnings. His concerns about declining China orders carry significant weight. While Apple's brand and AI efforts offer some support, Cramer's views are pretty bearish and others in the previous rounds are also bearish. Therefore I also predict that the stock price will fall, as the previous round did not indicate to me that there are information supporting the rising of the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings, citing weak China demand and underwhelming AI contributions.  Previous models largely agree on a higher probability of a price decline, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.  While Cramer's opinion is influential, it's crucial to note that his prediction is not based on hard financial data but rather on overall market sentiment and interpretations of Apple's AI strategy.  Apple's strong brand and historical performance could partially offset the negative impact of a missed earnings forecast.  Considering the consensus from previous models and the lack of concrete evidence beyond Cramer's assertion, I slightly adjust the probability downward compared to previous models. The possibility of a 'buy the dip' reaction shouldn't be fully discounted either, especially considering Apple's history.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news suggests that Jim Cramer, a prominent financial commentator, has a bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL). He specifically mentions that the company is likely to miss earnings, primarily due to weakening demand from China and doubts about the effectiveness of its AI innovations. Given Cramer's influence in the financial community, his negative sentiment is likely to impact investor confidence adversely. Additionally, the news lacks concrete positive catalysts that could offset this negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the short term. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly lean towards a decline, supporting this conclusion.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings despite its AI innovation. Cramer cites weak China orders and general market skepticism as key reasons for his negative stance. Given Cramer's influence and the negative sentiment around earnings, this news is likely to weigh on investor confidence in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand and long-term potential in AI could mitigate some of the downside. The overall tone of the news is negative, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline. Based on the information provided and the consensus from various models, it appears that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc. will miss its upcoming earnings, citing declining demand, especially from China, and doubts about the effectiveness of AI innovations. This negative outlook from a well-known financial commentator is likely to influence investor sentiment unfavorably. Although the article touches on other topics, the overall tone concerning Apple specifically is bearish. Considering the lack of concrete numerical data to support Cramer's assertions, but also acknowledging his influence and the general market skepticism, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising. However, Apple's strong brand and potential long-term benefits from AI innovations could somewhat mitigate the downside, preventing a complete collapse in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's pessimistic outlook on Apple Inc., predicting that the company will miss earnings expectations due to factors such as weak China orders and doubts about AI innovation. Cramer's views are influential among investors, and the negative sentiment expressed is likely to have a significant impact on market perception. Previous predictions predominantly show a consensus view leaning towards a decline in stock price, with probabilities ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 for a rise and from 0.6 to 0.8 for a fall. While there is some potential for short-term traders to see value in buying the dip, the cumulative negativity and Cramer's high profile make the overall probability of a stock price rise lower.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reflects a strong bearish sentiment regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL) as expressed by Jim Cramer, who predicts that the company will miss earnings expectations due to declining orders, particularly from China, and doubts about the effectiveness of AI innovations. Given Cramer's influence and the consensus among previous predictions, which overwhelmingly lean toward a decline in stock price, the outlook appears negative. Although some investors may see this as a potential buying opportunity due to Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the overall tone and predictions suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The consistency in negative sentiment from Jim Cramer regarding Apple's upcoming earnings, stemming from weak China orders and doubts surrounding AI innovation, continues to weigh heavily on investor expectations. The historical trend of predictions leaning towards a stock price decline has persisted across previous rounds. While Apple's brand strength provides some buffer, the lack of counterbalancing positive information strengthens the case for a continued negative price movement. Slight increase in the stock price rise as the time goes, showing some buy-the-dip activity taking place. However, will stay conservative on that.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings, citing weak China orders and underwhelming AI contributions.  This negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator is significant. Previous model predictions consistently favored a higher probability of a price fall (ranging from 0.6 to 0.8). While Apple's strong brand and historical performance could mitigate some negative impact, the weight of Cramer's opinion and the lack of countervailing positive news strongly suggest a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The consensus from previous rounds, coupled with the predominantly negative tone of the article, reinforces the prediction of a stock price decline.  However,  a small probability of a rise is maintained, acknowledging the possibility of a 'buy the dip' reaction from some investors and the potential that the market has already priced in some negative expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's bearish outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), predicting that the company will miss earnings due to declining orders from China and concerns over AI innovations.

The consensus from various models predominantly leans towards a decline in stock price, with probabilities of a fall ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 and a rise from 0.2 to 0.4. Considering the bearish outlook and the lack of concrete positive catalysts, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc.

The majority of past predictions from various models indicate a strong consensus towards a negative sentiment. Although Apple's strong brand and potential for long-term growth could provide some support, the overall tone of the news is predominantly negative. The high profile of Jim Cramer, along with the specific concerns raised, strongly influences the negative sentiments expressed.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Based on the analysis of Jim Cramer's predictions, there is a strong bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Cramer emphasizes concerns such as weak orders from China and doubts about the effectiveness of AI innovations, suggesting that Apple will miss earnings expectations. The consensus from previous models also consistently indicates a higher probability of a stock price decline, reflecting widespread negative sentiment among analysts. While Apple's strong brand might provide some cushion, the overwhelming negative commentary is likely to lead to investor caution, further biasing the probabilities towards a decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's persistent bearish outlook on Apple, particularly due to concerns over declining China orders and skepticism regarding AI innovations, continues to dominate investor sentiment. The consistent predictions of a stock price decline across multiple rounds underscore the negative impact of this news. While Apple's brand strength and potential \"buy the dip\" activity offer some resistance, these factors appear insufficient to counteract the overwhelming negative sentiment. Moreover, the slight uptick in the estimated probability of a stock price rise in previous rounds seems to plateau, suggesting that the buying opportunity influence might be waning. Given the absence of any offsetting positive news and the consistent negative outlook from a respected financial commentator, the probability of a stock price fall remains significantly higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article centers on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings, citing weak Chinese demand and underwhelming AI contributions.  This negative outlook from a prominent financial commentator carries significant weight.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple rounds of predictions from various AI models reinforces this negative outlook. Although Apple possesses a strong brand and potential long-term growth prospects,  the immediate impact of Cramer's prediction and the lack of countervailing positive information suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline. While a 'buy the dip' reaction from some investors is possible, the overall consensus points to a greater probability of a stock price fall. The slight increase in the probability of a rise across the rounds reflects some investors buying on the dip, but this is counterbalanced by the strong negative sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bearish outlook on Apple Inc.
