      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Falls on Report of China iPhone Discounts. \u2018Winter Is Here,\u2019 Analyst Says.\nNews Content: UBS analysts led by David Vogt slashed their iPhone sales estimates even further below Wall Street\u2019s consensus amid China weakness.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news report indicates a negative sentiment surrounding Apple due to a reduction in iPhone sales estimates by UBS analysts, driven by weakness in China. Such downgrades often lead to increased selling pressure on the stock as investors react to the potential decline in future revenue. The phrase 'Winter Is Here' suggests a larger, perhaps more dire trend that could further instill fear among investors. Given these factors, it is more likely that the stock price will fall rather than rise in the immediate future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content are negative for Apple. The headline clearly states a stock price fall and mentions 'winter is here,' implying a significant downturn. The UBS analyst report citing further cuts to iPhone sales estimates due to China weakness reinforces this negative sentiment. China is a crucial market for Apple. Reduced iPhone sales in China directly impact Apple's revenue and profitability. Analyst downgrades generally pressure stock prices downwards as investors and institutions reassess their positions based on the new information. Therefore, the likelihood of a price decrease is higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate negative sentiment towards Apple's stock.  UBS, a reputable financial institution, has significantly lowered its iPhone sales estimates due to weakness in the Chinese market, a crucial region for Apple's revenue.  The phrase 'Winter Is Here' from the analyst reinforces this pessimistic outlook.  While other factors could influence Apple's stock price, this specific news directly points to decreased sales expectations, a key driver for stock valuation. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing challenges in China, with UBS analysts lowering iPhone sales estimates due to weakness in the region. This suggests potential revenue and profitability concerns, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Historically, negative analyst revisions and reports of discounted sales to stimulate demand are often viewed as bearish signals by the market. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to fall in the short term as investors react to the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.'s stock is falling due to a report of China iPhone discounts. Additionally, UBS analysts have slashed their iPhone sales estimates amid weakness in China. This suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock in the short term, as reduced sales estimates and discounts typically imply decreased revenue and potentially lower stock prices. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple's stock due to reports of iPhone discounts in China and slashed iPhone sales estimates by UBS analysts. This suggests a potential decline in Apple's sales and revenue, which could negatively impact the stock price. Given this information, it is likely that the stock price will fall. The probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of the stock price falling is high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential decline in iPhone sales in China due to discounts, which is a significant market for Apple. UBS analysts have also lowered their sales estimates below Wall Street's expectations. This negative outlook from a respected analyst firm along with operational challenges in a key market typically leads to a decrease in stock prices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
