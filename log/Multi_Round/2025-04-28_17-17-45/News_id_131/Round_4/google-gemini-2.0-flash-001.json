(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\nNews Content: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently experiencing significant stock price pressure, having dropped 11% at the start of the year, the worst performance since 2008. The stock is nearing a critical technical level near the 200-day moving average, which is seen as a long-term support level. Analysts express concern around confidence in Apple\u2019s uptrend given the proximity to this technical level. The context of a stronger S&P 500 also puts additional pressure on Apple as it lags behind other major indices. The upcoming earnings report may influence volatility, but with current trends showing a drop and analysts noting possible headwinds, there is a higher probability of further decline in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Apple's stock is underperforming the market significantly, experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008. It's nearing a key support level (200-day moving average), and analysts are expressing concern about a potential breach of that level, which could trigger further losses. Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market value, highlighting its relative weakness. The overall market resilience despite Apple's decline suggests the company-specific issues are driving the downturn. However, there's also some potentially positive information: analysts remain optimistic about future growth in services and wearables and predict Q1 earnings might not disappoint. Also, Trump's announcement about Apple's planned \"massive investment\" in the U.S. presents some positive sentiment. The earnings release on January 30 acts as a major uncertainty factor, potentially creating volatility. Given the significant recent underperformance, breach of the 200-day moving average acting as a psychological resistance level, and general negative sentiment presented here, the probability of a fall is judged to be more significant. The probability of fall has been given prominence due to the negative sentiment provided by external entities in the article and the technical analysis. However, the positive estimates and the possibility of the news being priced in reduce the probability of further falls.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% drop and its share price nearing a critical 200-day moving average.  Analyst quotes express concern about a potential loss of confidence if this level is broken.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing growth potential in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings are anticipated, the immediate sentiment is negative due to the significant price drop and proximity to a key technical support level.  The overall market context is also a factor; if other tech giants follow suit, it could further negatively impact Apple's price.  Therefore, while there's a possibility of a positive reaction based on upcoming earnings, the immediate risk of a further decline outweighs the potential for a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares dropping significantly. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could signal further losses and erode investor confidence. The article also mentions that Apple's earnings report is upcoming, which could provide clarity, but current sentiment is cautious. The stock's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its loss of market value leadership to Nvidia adds to the negative outlook. While some analysts remain optimistic about long-term growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate technical and market sentiment suggests downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's stock experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% drop. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. If this level is breached, it could signal further losses and erode confidence in the stock's uptrend. Despite analysts' optimism about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables, the current technical indicators and market performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 could be a significant catalyst, but given the current trend, the probability of a stock price rise seems lower.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock is nearing a critical level, with its shares approaching the 200-day moving average, a significant technical indicator. This, combined with the stock's weakest start to the year since 2008, suggests a possible loss of confidence in the uptrend. However, analysts remain optimistic about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 will be closely watched by investors. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the current downward trend and technical indicators, but the optimism from analysts provides some balance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view, believing in growth potential from services and wearables despite current softness in the iPhone cycle. Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has experienced an 11% decline at the start of 2025, the worst performance since 2008, which places its stock price near a critical 200-day moving average. Analysts express concern that breaching this level could result in further declines and erode confidence in the stock's uptrend. Despite some optimism regarding future earnings and growth in services and wearables, the current negative sentiment surrounding the stock and its significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 strengthens the likelihood of a price drop. The upcoming earnings report adds an element of uncertainty but does not significantly alter the prevailing bearish outlook given the immediate technical pressures and broader market context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The repeated negative sentiment, marked by Apple's worst start since 2008 and the stock nearing a critical support level, continues to dominate the analysis. Despite analysts' long-term optimism, the immediate technical indicators and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 weigh heavily. The consensus from previous rounds leans heavily towards a likely price decrease. Given this prevailing negative perspective and the consistency across rounds, I will adjust to a slightly more pessimistic estimate while still acknowledging the hints of optimism and the nearing earnings release that could shift the overall picture.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The significantly negative factors are the 11% year-to-date drop (worst since 2008), the proximity to the 200-day moving average (a key support level), and analyst concerns about losing confidence in the uptrend if this level is breached.  Nvidia surpassing Apple in market cap further highlights the negative sentiment. However, counterbalancing this negativity are analyst optimism regarding future growth in services and wearables, expectations of solid Q1 earnings, and the announced \"massive investment\" in the US.  The upcoming earnings report is a major wildcard, potentially causing significant volatility.  Considering the weight of negative factors like the substantial drop and the technical indicator, coupled with the consistent predictions from other models leaning towards a fall, I assign a higher probability to a price fall. The positive factors, while present, are not sufficient to outweigh the current negative momentum and technical concerns in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing significant downward pressure, with an 11% drop since the start of the year, the worst performance since 2008. The stock is nearing a critical technical level (200-day moving average), which could trigger further losses if breached. Analysts express concerns about confidence in Apple's uptrend, and the stock's underperformance contrasts with the S&P 500's gains. While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term growth in services and wearables, the immediate technical and market sentiment leans negative. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds volatility but does not outweigh the current downward trend. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's stock experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% drop. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. If this level is breached, it could signal further losses and erode confidence in the stock's uptrend. Despite analysts' optimism about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables, and the possibility of a positive earnings report, the current technical indicators and market performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The overall negative sentiment and technical analysis provided by analysts suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% drop in stock price, nearing a critical 200-day moving average. Analysts express concern about a potential breach of this level, which could signal further losses and erode investor confidence. Despite optimism about long-term growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate technical indicators and market performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The upcoming quarterly earnings release could be a catalyst, but given the current trend, the probability of a stock price rise seems lower. Considering the analysis and previous predictions, the estimated probabilities are based on the overall negative sentiment and technical analysis presented.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year.

Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment. Combining the current negative momentum and the potential upcoming catalyst such as the earnings release, there is a slightly weighted expectation towards a fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing significant downward pressure, with an 11% decline in early 2025, marking its worst performance since 2008. The stock is nearing the critical 200-day moving average, a key technical support level, raising concerns about a potential breach that could trigger further losses and diminish investor confidence. While some analysts express cautious optimism about Apple's future earnings and growth in services and wearables, the immediate sentiment remains negative due to the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the competition from Nvidia. As the upcoming earnings report could introduce volatility, the dominant sentiments lean heavily toward further declines given the current technical issues and negative market climate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.29, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.71, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds, as evidenced by its worst start to the year since 2008 and a substantial 11% drop. The proximity to the 200-day moving average, a critical technical level, adds to the bearish sentiment. Analyst commentary reflects concerns about the stock's uptrend and potential for further losses if this level is breached. While there's optimism about Apple's long-term prospects, particularly in services and wearables, and an upcoming earnings report offers potential upside, the prevailing negative momentum and technical indicators make a price decline more probable. Previous rounds also converge on this bearish outlook, reinforcing the likelihood of a price fall in the short term. Therefore, I have adjusted my probabilities to reflect these factors, emphasizing the potential for a continued decline while acknowledging the potential for positive surprises from earnings or other news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Negative factors heavily outweigh the positive ones.  The 11% year-to-date drop, the worst since 2008, is a significant headwind. The proximity to the 200-day moving average, a key support level, increases the risk of further declines if broken. Analyst concerns about loss of confidence further amplify the negative sentiment.  Nvidia's surpassing of Apple in market capitalization underscores Apple's relative weakness. While analysts express some optimism about long-term growth in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings might be positive, these factors are not sufficient to counter the immediate negative pressure.  Previous predictions consistently lean towards a price fall, reinforcing the negative outlook. Although the earnings report on January 30 could introduce volatility, the current negative momentum and technical indicators strongly suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) facing significant downward pressure with an 11% drop since the start of 2025, marking its worst performance since 2008. The stock is nearing a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, which if breached, could signal further losses and erode investor confidence. Analysts express concerns about the stock's uptrend, and its underperformance contrasts with the S&P 500's gains. While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term growth in services and wearables, the immediate technical and market sentiment leans negative. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 adds volatility but does not outweigh the current downward trend. Given these factors and the consensus from previous predictions leaning towards a fall, the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.

Analysts express concern that breaching this level could signal further losses and erode confidence in the stock's uptrend. Despite some optimism regarding future growth in services and wearables, and the potential for a positive earnings report, the current negative sentiment and technical indicators suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.

This technical indicator, combined with analyst concerns about a potential breach of this level and the overall negative sentiment, suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Additionally, the stock's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its loss of market value leadership to Nvidia contribute to the downward pressure. While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate technical indicators and market performance indicate a higher probability of a decline. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 could introduce volatility, but given the current trend and consistent negative predictions from previous rounds, the estimated probabilities lean towards a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant stock price decline in the early part of 2025, marking its worst start since 2008. The stock approach towards a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, increases concerns about further losses and potential erosion of investor confidence. Although there is some optimism from analysts regarding Apple's services and wearables segment, the current bearish momentum and underperformance against the S&P 500, along with the technical sell-off, tilt the probability towards a decline. Nonetheless, the upcoming earnings could bring some short-term volatility, but the overall trend and sentiment point towards a declining stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is seeing significant downward pressure, with an 11% drop at the start of 2025, marking the worst performance since 2008. The stock is nearing a critical 200-day moving average, which analysts fear could trigger further declines and erode investor confidence if breached. While there are positive sentiments regarding potential growth in services and wearables, the immediate technical indicators and negative sentiment surrounding the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 heavily weigh on the stock's outlook. Upcoming earnings may introduce volatility, but given the current trends and sentiments, the likelihood of the stock price falling remains higher.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently facing notable downward pressure, experiencing an 11% decline since the start of 2025, its worst performance since 2008. The stock price is approaching a critical technical level, the 200-day moving average, heightening concerns about a potential breach that could trigger subsequent losses and reduce investor confidence. Although some analysts have stated cautious optimism around Apple's earnings and potential growth in services and wearables, negative sentiment prevails, driven by the stock's lagging performance relative to the S&P 500 and competition from Nvidia. Given the convergence of negative sentiment and the consistent predictions from previous rounds, there is a high probability of further price decline. The upcoming earnings report introduces a short-term uncertainty, but given the momentum is downwards and the technical indicators are bearish, the dominant sentiment is of further decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a strongly bearish outlook for Apple in the short term.  The combination of the worst start to a year since 2008 (-11%), the proximity to the crucial 200-day moving average (a key support level), and widespread analyst concern regarding the loss of confidence in the uptrend all heavily favor a price drop.  While there is some optimism regarding long-term growth potential in services and wearables, and the upcoming earnings report could bring volatility, these positive factors are considerably outweighed by the current negative momentum and technical indicators.  The consistent bearish predictions across multiple rounds of previous analyses further reinforce this outlook.  Although a surprise positive earnings announcement or other unforeseen news could trigger a price rise, the probability of that happening in the short-term is significantly lower than the probability of a further decline given the current context. The fact that Nvidia surpassed Apple in market cap only strengthens this narrative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant stock price decline in early 2025, marking its worst start since 2008.
