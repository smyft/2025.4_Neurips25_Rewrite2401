(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\nNews Content: Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,\" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.\n\nTrending: Coinbase\u2019s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) \u2014 Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on January 30, after market close, an event that investors are closely watching.\u00a0Despite the stock\u2019s current performance, analysts remain optimistic about Apple\u2019s future. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, believes that Apple\u2019s dependence on the iPhone remains, but services and wearables offer growth potential. Additionally, Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Securities predicts that Apple\u2019s Q1 earnings might not miss a beat, despite a softer iPhone cycle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Apple was planning a \u201cmassive investment\u201d in the United States. This was part of Trump\u2019s initiative to accelerate major corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nPrice Action: Apple shares ended 0.39% lower on Friday. Year-to-date the company\u2019s shares lost 8.64%, as reported by Benzinga Pro.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is currently experiencing significant stock price pressure, having dropped 11% at the start of the year, the worst performance since 2008. The stock is nearing a critical technical level near the 200-day moving average, which is seen as a long-term support level. Analysts express concern around confidence in Apple\u2019s uptrend given the proximity to this technical level. The context of a stronger S&P 500 also puts additional pressure on Apple as it lags behind other major indices. The upcoming earnings report may influence volatility, but with current trends showing a drop and analysts noting possible headwinds, there is a higher probability of further decline in stock price compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Apple's stock is underperforming the market significantly, experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008. It's nearing a key support level (200-day moving average), and analysts are expressing concern about a potential breach of that level, which could trigger further losses. Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market value, highlighting its relative weakness. The overall market resilience despite Apple's decline suggests the company-specific issues are driving the downturn. However, there's also some potentially positive information: analysts remain optimistic about future growth in services and wearables and predict Q1 earnings might not disappoint. Also, Trump's announcement about Apple's planned \"massive investment\" in the U.S. presents some positive sentiment. The earnings release on January 30 acts as a major uncertainty factor, potentially creating volatility. Given the significant recent underperformance, breach of the 200-day moving average acting as a psychological resistance level, and general negative sentiment presented here, the probability of a fall is judged to be more significant. The probability of fall has been given prominence due to the negative sentiment provided by external entities in the article and the technical analysis. However, the positive estimates and the possibility of the news being priced in reduce the probability of further falls.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% drop and its share price nearing a critical 200-day moving average.  Analyst quotes express concern about a potential loss of confidence if this level is broken.  While some analysts remain optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects citing growth potential in services and wearables, and upcoming earnings are anticipated, the immediate sentiment is negative due to the significant price drop and proximity to a key technical support level.  The overall market context is also a factor; if other tech giants follow suit, it could further negatively impact Apple's price.  Therefore, while there's a possibility of a positive reaction based on upcoming earnings, the immediate risk of a further decline outweighs the potential for a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with shares dropping significantly. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. Analysts suggest that if this level is breached, it could signal further losses and erode investor confidence. The article also mentions that Apple's earnings report is upcoming, which could provide clarity, but current sentiment is cautious. The stock's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its loss of market value leadership to Nvidia adds to the negative outlook. While some analysts remain optimistic about long-term growth potential in services and wearables, the immediate technical and market sentiment suggests downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's stock experiencing its worst start to the year since 2008, with an 11% drop. The stock is nearing its 200-day moving average, a critical technical support level. If this level is breached, it could signal further losses and erode confidence in the stock's uptrend. Despite analysts' optimism about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables, the current technical indicators and market performance suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 could be a significant catalyst, but given the current trend, the probability of a stock price rise seems lower.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock is nearing a critical level, with its shares approaching the 200-day moving average, a significant technical indicator. This, combined with the stock's weakest start to the year since 2008, suggests a possible loss of confidence in the uptrend. However, analysts remain optimistic about Apple's future, citing growth potential in services and wearables. The upcoming quarterly earnings release on January 30 will be closely watched by investors. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher due to the current downward trend and technical indicators, but the optimism from analysts provides some balance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a challenging start for Apple Inc. in 2025, with a 11% decline since the start of the year. The stock approaching the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator, raises concerns among traders. Analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic view, believing in growth potential from services and wearables despite current softness in the iPhone cycle. Scheduled earnings could provide a clearer picture, adding volatility. The broader market context, where the S&P 500 is performing well, contrasts with Apple's performance, which may amplify investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
