(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Earnings Strength Keeps BofA Bullish Despite iPhone Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a Buy at BofA Securities, though analysts trimmed the price target to $253 from $256, citing a weaker iPhone outlook. Despite this, the firm sees earnings resiliency as a key strength heading into Apple's January 30 earnings report. BofA expects a strong fiscal Q1, with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments, slightly ahead of Wall Street's 77 million estimate.\n\nHowever, Q2 could be weaker, with BofA lowering its iPhone forecast to 49 million units from 56 million, citing macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Beyond hardware, Services remains a bright spot, with 13% growth expected in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year. App Store revenue jumped 15% year-over-year, signaling strong demand.\n\nAnalysts also believe China concerns are overblown and expect Trump's administration to ease regulatory pressures from the EU and U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Apple's in-house 5G modem in the iPhone SE could boost margins if successful.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating, expects strong fiscal Q1 revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, and highlights robust Services growth (13-14% YoY). App Store revenue growth (15% YoY) and potential easing of regulatory pressures are additional positives. However, the trimmed price target (from $256 to $253) and lowered Q2 iPhone forecasts (49M vs. 56M) due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features introduce downside risks.
