A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Nvidia's launch of AI safety tools and the potential impact of Trump's administration on semiconductor regulations. While this may directly benefit Nvidia, it indirectly affects the sentiment in the technology sector, including Apple Inc. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration indicates a strong position for big tech. However, overall market volatility related to upcoming regulations and tariffs may pose risks. Given Nvidia's recent strong performance, it might cast a positive light on related tech stocks, but uncertainty remains due to potential regulatory changes. Therefore, there's a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock remaining stable or slightly rising as the sentiment for the tech sector and AI continues to be bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia (NVDA) and potential regulatory impacts under a new Trump administration. While Nvidia launching AI safety tools is positive for NVDA, the absence of their CEO at the inauguration and his comments on potential easing of regulations under Trump, along with worries about tariffs, creates mixed signals. The presence of Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, at the inauguration, combined with no specific mention of a direct positive or negative effect on Apple, suggests a neutral to slightly positive impact. The article contains no hard details on implications for Apple. Any actual impact on Apple may be indirect due to general market sentiment from new regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Nvidia's (NVDA) activities, including the release of new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.  While the article mentions Apple's CEO attending the inauguration, there's no direct impact on Apple's business or stock price implied in the news. Apple's stock movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Nvidia's advancements in AI safety or the political event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this particular news is considered very low, with the probabilities near equal chance of slight movement up or down, reflecting general market fluctuations rather than a direct news impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration, with minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the mention of Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration could be seen as neutral to slightly positive, indicating continued engagement with political events. The broader context of potential semiconductor regulations and tariffs might indirectly affect Apple, but the direct impact of this specific news is limited. Given the lack of significant negative or positive catalysts for Apple in this news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly influenced by broader market trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and its unveiling of AI safety tools to boost enterprise trust, as well as the absence of its CEO Jensen Huang at Trump's inauguration. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) only in the context of its CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration, alongside other Big Tech leaders. There is no directly relevant information about Apple Inc. that would suggest a significant impact on its stock price from this news. Given the lack of specific news about Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools to boost enterprise trust and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. Although the news is primarily about Nvidia, it mentions Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook attending the inauguration. The main focus of the article is on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential impact of the Trump administration on the semiconductor industry. The news does not directly relate to Apple's financials or operations. However, the overall sentiment of the article is neutral to positive, as it highlights the growth of AI technology and the potential for increased trust in enterprise applications. Given that the news is not directly related to Apple, the probability of a significant impact on Apple's stock price is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
