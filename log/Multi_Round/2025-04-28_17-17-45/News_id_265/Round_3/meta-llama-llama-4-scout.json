A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Nvidia's launch of AI safety tools and the potential impact of Trump's administration on semiconductor regulations. While this may directly benefit Nvidia, it indirectly affects the sentiment in the technology sector, including Apple Inc. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration indicates a strong position for big tech. However, overall market volatility related to upcoming regulations and tariffs may pose risks. Given Nvidia's recent strong performance, it might cast a positive light on related tech stocks, but uncertainty remains due to potential regulatory changes. Therefore, there's a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock remaining stable or slightly rising as the sentiment for the tech sector and AI continues to be bullish.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia (NVDA) and potential regulatory impacts under a new Trump administration. While Nvidia launching AI safety tools is positive for NVDA, the absence of their CEO at the inauguration and his comments on potential easing of regulations under Trump, along with worries about tariffs, creates mixed signals. The presence of Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, at the inauguration, combined with no specific mention of a direct positive or negative effect on Apple, suggests a neutral to slightly positive impact. The article contains no hard details on implications for Apple. Any actual impact on Apple may be indirect due to general market sentiment from new regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Nvidia's (NVDA) activities, including the release of new AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.  While the article mentions Apple's CEO attending the inauguration, there's no direct impact on Apple's business or stock price implied in the news. Apple's stock movement is unlikely to be significantly affected by Nvidia's advancements in AI safety or the political event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this particular news is considered very low, with the probabilities near equal chance of slight movement up or down, reflecting general market fluctuations rather than a direct news impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration, with minimal direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the mention of Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration could be seen as neutral to slightly positive, indicating continued engagement with political events. The broader context of potential semiconductor regulations and tariffs might indirectly affect Apple, but the direct impact of this specific news is limited. Given the lack of significant negative or positive catalysts for Apple in this news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly influenced by broader market trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and its unveiling of AI safety tools to boost enterprise trust, as well as the absence of its CEO Jensen Huang at Trump's inauguration. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) only in the context of its CEO Tim Cook attending the inauguration, alongside other Big Tech leaders. There is no directly relevant information about Apple Inc. that would suggest a significant impact on its stock price from this news. Given the lack of specific news about Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools to boost enterprise trust and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. Although the news is primarily about Nvidia, it mentions Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook attending the inauguration. The main focus of the article is on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential impact of the Trump administration on the semiconductor industry. The news does not directly relate to Apple's financials or operations. However, the overall sentiment of the article is neutral to positive, as it highlights the growth of AI technology and the potential for increased trust in enterprise applications. Given that the news is not directly related to Apple, the probability of a significant impact on Apple's stock price is low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news largely centers around Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential regulatory landscape under the incoming Trump administration, with indirect implications for Apple Inc. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration may be viewed as positive for big tech sentiment, but there is no direct mention of Apple in a way that suggests a strong impact on its stock price. The mixed signals regarding potential tariffs and regulations in the semiconductor sector add a layer of uncertainty that could dampen investor confidence. Given the overall context, the probabilities suggest a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, consistent with previous assessments from other models. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia and the potential impact of new regulations under the Trump administration. The attendance of Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, at the inauguration alongside other big tech leaders suggests a neutral to slightly positive sentiment for Apple in the political arena. There's no direct negative or positive news specifically about Apple. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a slightly bullish but mostly neutral sentiment surrounding Apple's stock, with most models suggesting a slight rise or neutral impact. Given this and the increased stability, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly better than the probability of it falling, but not by a huge margin.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses heavily on Nvidia and its activities, with only tangential mention of Apple.  Nvidia's new AI safety tools and CEO's absence from the inauguration are not directly relevant to Apple's performance.  Apple's CEO attending the inauguration is a neutral event, providing no significant positive or negative signal.  The previous predictions range from near equal probabilities of rise and fall to a very low probability of change in either direction. Considering the lack of direct Apple-related news and the generally neutral to slightly positive sentiment surrounding the broader tech sector (implied by the positive Nvidia news and Cook's attendance), a slight upward movement is possible, but it's likely to be minimal and driven more by overall market sentiment than by the specific news.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive bias due to indirect impacts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia's activities, including the launch of AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration. While Apple's CEO Tim Cook is mentioned as attending the inauguration, there is no direct impact on Apple's business or stock price implied in the news. The broader context of potential semiconductor regulations and tariffs might indirectly affect Apple, but the direct impact of this specific news is limited. Given the lack of significant positive or negative catalysts for Apple in this news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly influenced by broader market trends. Previous predictions also suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact, with probabilities near equal chance of slight movement up or down.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration. Apple Inc. is mentioned only in the context of its CEO, Tim Cook, attending the inauguration. There is no direct information about Apple's business or financials in the article. Given the lack of specific news about Apple and the neutral to positive overall sentiment about tech and AI, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, considering the general positive trend in the tech sector and the presence of the CEO at a significant event, there is a slight inclination towards a positive impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Nvidia's launch of AI safety tools and the potential impact of Trump's administration on semiconductor regulations. Although Apple Inc. is mentioned, the context is limited to Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration alongside other Big Tech leaders. There is no direct significant positive or negative information about Apple Inc. that would suggest a substantial impact on its stock price from this news. Considering the broader context of potential semiconductor regulations and tariffs, and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment for the tech sector due to AI advancements, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. Given the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple and the mixed signals regarding regulatory changes, the estimated probabilities are closer to neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Nvidia and its initiatives in AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration. While this news may positively influence the sentiments towards AI technology and Nvidia's performance, it has no direct implications on Apple Inc.'s operations. The mention of Apple's CEO attending the inauguration suggests continuity in the relationship between major tech companies and political leadership. However, general geopolitical tensions and uncertainties about potential regulations and tariffs may introduce some level of risk aversion, impacting the broader market including Apple. Yet, given the lack of specific and direct impact on Apple's standing from this news, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to remain neutral.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which suggests a positive sentiment for Nvidia but does not directly relate to Apple's business activities. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration along with other tech leaders indicates a stable positioning within the industry. However, concerns around potential semiconductor regulations and tariffs may create some uncertainty. Overall, the lack of direct impact on Apple from this specific news leads to a balanced outlook, with a slight inclination towards a potential rise in stock price due to the positive sentiment in the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia and the incoming Trump administration's potential impact on the semiconductor industry. While Apple's CEO is attending the inauguration, there's no specific positive or negative news directly impacting Apple. Previous predictions were largely neutral to slightly positive. Considering everything, I'll slightly lean towards a neutral stance, but with slightly less certainty. I'll lower the probability of a rise to account for potential volatility related to these factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news article focuses primarily on Nvidia, with only tangential relevance to Apple.  Nvidia's AI safety tool launch is positive for the company, but its CEO's absence from the inauguration and potential regulatory changes under the Trump administration create uncertainty.  Apple's CEO attending the inauguration offers a slightly positive signal for the broader tech sector's relationship with the new administration. However, there's no direct news impacting Apple's fundamentals.  The previous predictions show a convergence towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, largely driven by the overall sentiment in the tech sector and speculation about the broader impact of new regulations. The lack of direct news about Apple minimizes the potential for a significant stock movement. Considering this indirect influence and the trend of previous predictions, a small increase is slightly more probable than a decrease, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia's activities, including the launch of AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration.

The attendance of Tim Cook at the inauguration may be seen as a neutral to slightly positive signal, but the overall impact is minimal. Considering the previous predictions and the indirect nature of the news' relevance to Apple, the estimated probabilities are near neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration.
