A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 4% year-over-year and beat consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS. However, there were notable weaknesses in key geographic segments, particularly a significant decline in Greater China revenue, which was substantially below expectations. Despite strong performance in other regions and product segments (like Services and Mac), the overall sentiment might be tempered due to the disappointing results in pivotal markets. The stock has also returned negatively in the prior month, and with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), it suggests potential underperformance in the near term. Hence, while there are positive indicators, the mix of strong earnings amidst significant regional weaknesses leads to a cautious outlook on stock movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While revenue and EPS beat estimates, and several product categories (Mac, iPad) and geographic regions (Europe, Japan) showed strong growth and exceeded expectations, the Greater China region experienced a significant decline. iPhone revenue was slightly below expectations, and Wearables, Home and Accessories also missed estimates. Overall revenue and EPS surprises were relatively small. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the past month suggest negative sentiment toward the stock. Considering these factors, a slight dip is more likely than significant rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2024 earnings showed a slight beat on both revenue and EPS compared to analyst estimates. However, a closer look at the geographic and product-line revenue reveals a mixed picture. While some segments like Europe and Japan showed strong growth, Greater China experienced a significant decline.  The iPhone, Apple's flagship product, saw a slight year-over-year decrease in revenue, failing to meet expectations, although this was slightly offset by strong growth in other product lines such as Mac and iPad.  The overall picture is one of modest growth with some concerning regional trends. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests a bearish outlook in the short-term. While the earnings beat is positive, the mixed performance across various segments, coupled with a negative Zacks rank and recent underperformance (-4.4% vs S&P 500 +1.2%), weighs heavily on the probability of a price rise. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc.'s Q1 earnings report reveals mixed results. While the company reported a slight revenue and EPS beat compared to consensus estimates, there are concerns in key areas. The Greater China revenue declined significantly by -11.1% year-over-year, missing estimates. iPhone and Wearables also showed negative year-over-year growth. However, strong performances in Europe, Japan, Americas, Services, Mac, and iPad segments provided some positive momentum. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) recommendation and recent underperformance (-4.4% over the past month) suggest caution. The overall mixed results and Sell rating tilt the probabilities slightly towards a negative reaction, but the small beats on revenue and EPS may provide some support.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported Q1 earnings with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the same period last year. The revenue and EPS both slightly beat estimates, with a revenue surprise of +0.24% and an EPS surprise of +1.69%. While some geographic and product segments showed strong growth (e.g., Europe, Japan, Mac, iPad), others declined (e.g., Greater China, Wearables, Home and Accessories). Despite the overall positive earnings report, the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has returned -4.4% over the past month. Given the mixed performance and the current negative trend, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple's Q1 earnings report shows a mixed picture. While the company's revenue and EPS beats the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the year-over-year changes in key metrics such as revenue from iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories are negative. Additionally, the revenue from Greater China declined by 11.1% year-over-year. However, the company's revenue from Europe, Japan, and the Americas showed significant growth, and the net sales of services increased by 13.9% year-over-year. Considering these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by the overall positive earnings report, but the negative year-over-year changes in some key metrics may limit the upside. Given the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the stock's underperformance in the past month, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
