While revenue and EPS beat estimates, and several product categories (Mac, iPad) and geographic regions (Europe, Japan) showed strong growth and exceeded expectations, the Greater China region experienced a significant decline. iPhone revenue was slightly below expectations, and Wearables, Home and Accessories also missed estimates. Overall revenue and EPS surprises were relatively small. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the past month suggest negative sentiment toward the stock. Considering these factors, a slight dip is more likely than significant rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Compared to Estimates, Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Key Metrics\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.40,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.60\n}\n```"
