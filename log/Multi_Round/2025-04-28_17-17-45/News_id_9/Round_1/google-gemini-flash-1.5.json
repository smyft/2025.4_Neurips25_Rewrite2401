      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: US Equity Indexes Trade Close to Record Highs as Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Meets Expectations\nNews Content: US equity indexes rose as a closely monitored inflation measure met expectations and earnings from A\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by favorable inflation data meeting expectations. This positive economic outlook can lead to increased investor confidence, possibly boosting Apple Inc.'s stock price. Given that Apple is a significant player in the tech sector, its stock often moves in correlation with broader market trends. Therefore, the likelihood of a stock price rise is higher than that of a fall, especially considering the positive sentiment around equities and the company\u2019s strong performance background.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment driven by inflation data meeting expectations and positive earnings reports (although details are hidden behind a paywall). This suggests a favorable environment for equities in general. Since Apple is a major component of US equity indexes, its stock price is likely to benefit from this overall positive market trend. However, the lack of specific information regarding Apple's individual performance introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderately high, while the probability of a decrease exists but is lower.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes, including the one Apple is listed on, rose because a key inflation indicator met expectations.  This suggests a positive market sentiment. While the news article itself is inaccessible, the headline's positive tone suggests a generally positive impact on the market. However,  the impact on Apple specifically is unclear due to lack of information on Apple's earnings or other company-specific news.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the overall market positivity indicated, but acknowledging the uncertainty related to the hidden news content.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which generally bodes well for major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since Apple is a large-cap stock often correlated with broader market trends, the likelihood of its stock price rising is higher in this environment. However, since the full content of the news is not available (paywalled), the impact cannot be fully assessed, leaving some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes, including those where Apple Inc. (AAPL) is listed, are trading close to record highs. This suggests a positive market sentiment. Additionally, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations could imply a stable economic environment, which is typically favorable for stock prices. However, the specific impact on AAPL's stock price depends on various factors, including the company's recent performance and market expectations. Given the overall positive tone of the news and assuming AAPL's recent earnings report was favorable (as implied by 'earnings from A'), there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which suggests a positive market sentiment. Additionally, the inflation gauge meeting expectations is a neutral to slightly positive signal, as it reduces the likelihood of unexpected interest rate changes that could impact the stock market. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a component of major US equity indexes and tends to follow overall market trends, it is likely that the company's stock price will rise or remain stable in this context. However, without access to the full news content due to the premium requirement, the analysis is based solely on the provided headline and general market principles.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which suggests positive market sentiment. Furthermore, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations may alleviate concerns over higher interest rates, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. However, the incomplete news content prevents a comprehensive analysis. Given the generally positive context, there's a moderate likelihood that Apple's stock price could respond favorably.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
