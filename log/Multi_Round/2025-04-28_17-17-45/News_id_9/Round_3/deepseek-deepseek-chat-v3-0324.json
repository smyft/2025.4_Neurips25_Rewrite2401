A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by favorable inflation data meeting expectations. This positive economic outlook can lead to increased investor confidence, possibly boosting Apple Inc.'s stock price. Given that Apple is a significant player in the tech sector, its stock often moves in correlation with broader market trends. Therefore, the likelihood of a stock price rise is higher than that of a fall, especially considering the positive sentiment around equities and the company\u2019s strong performance background.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment driven by inflation data meeting expectations and positive earnings reports (although details are hidden behind a paywall). This suggests a favorable environment for equities in general. Since Apple is a major component of US equity indexes, its stock price is likely to benefit from this overall positive market trend. However, the lack of specific information regarding Apple's individual performance introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderately high, while the probability of a decrease exists but is lower.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes, including the one Apple is listed on, rose because a key inflation indicator met expectations.  This suggests a positive market sentiment. While the news article itself is inaccessible, the headline's positive tone suggests a generally positive impact on the market. However,  the impact on Apple specifically is unclear due to lack of information on Apple's earnings or other company-specific news.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the overall market positivity indicated, but acknowledging the uncertainty related to the hidden news content.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which generally bodes well for major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since Apple is a large-cap stock often correlated with broader market trends, the likelihood of its stock price rising is higher in this environment. However, since the full content of the news is not available (paywalled), the impact cannot be fully assessed, leaving some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes, including those where Apple Inc. (AAPL) is listed, are trading close to record highs. This suggests a positive market sentiment. Additionally, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations could imply a stable economic environment, which is typically favorable for stock prices. However, the specific impact on AAPL's stock price depends on various factors, including the company's recent performance and market expectations. Given the overall positive tone of the news and assuming AAPL's recent earnings report was favorable (as implied by 'earnings from A'), there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which suggests a positive market sentiment. Additionally, the inflation gauge meeting expectations is a neutral to slightly positive signal, as it reduces the likelihood of unexpected interest rate changes that could impact the stock market. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a component of major US equity indexes and tends to follow overall market trends, it is likely that the company's stock price will rise or remain stable in this context. However, without access to the full news content due to the premium requirement, the analysis is based solely on the provided headline and general market principles.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which suggests positive market sentiment. Furthermore, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations may alleviate concerns over higher interest rates, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. However, the incomplete news content prevents a comprehensive analysis. Given the generally positive context, there's a moderate likelihood that Apple's stock price could respond favorably.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs due to favorable inflation data meeting expectations, which reflects a positive economic outlook. This sentiment tends to uplift the stock prices of major companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is a significant component of these indexes. While there are uncertainties due to the paywalled details of the earnings report, the overall positive market conditions suggest a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising. Based on the consensus from previous predictions and the solid relationship between market sentiment and AAPL's performance, I estimate a probability of around 0.7 for the stock price rising, with a correspondingly lower probability of 0.3 for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The dominant sentiment from previous rounds leans towards a stock price increase due to positive market indicators (equity indexes near record highs, inflation data meeting expectations). While the full news content remains inaccessible due to the paywall, the consensus is that Apple, being a significant player in these indexes, is likely to benefit from the general market positivity. The trend seems to hover between 0.6 and 0.75 for a rise in stock price. Given this collective assessment, and the lack of strongly negative information to counter the prevailing optimism, I'm placing the probability of a price rise slightly higher, while still acknowledging the informational limitations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market environment, with US equity indexes near record highs due to inflation data meeting expectations.  This generally positive market sentiment suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, as it's a major component of these indexes and typically correlates with broader market trends.  However, the lack of access to the full news article (which might contain details about Apple's specific performance or other relevant information) introduces uncertainty.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.6 to 0.75 for the probability of a price rise, and the generally positive macroeconomic context, I'm assigning a probability slightly higher than the average of the previous models.  The risk of a price fall is acknowledged but considered less likely given the overall positive news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment with US equity indexes trading close to record highs, driven by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This generally bodes well for major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL), which tends to correlate with broader market trends. Previous predictions from various models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with an average around 0.65 for a rise and 0.35 for a fall. The lack of specific negative information about Apple in the headline further supports a slightly bullish outlook. However, the uncertainty due to the paywalled content slightly tempers the positivity.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which generally bodes well for major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since Apple is a large-cap stock often correlated with broader market trends, the likelihood of its stock price rising is higher in this environment. Although the full content of the news is not available, the overall positive tone and Apple's strong market presence imply a higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which generally bodes well for major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since Apple is a large-cap stock often correlated with broader market trends, the likelihood of its stock price rising is higher in this environment. Considering the predictions from other models, which range from 0.6 to 0.75 for a stock price rise, and taking into account the overall positive tone of the news, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. The lack of specific information about Apple's earnings or other company-specific news introduces some uncertainty, but the general market positivity and the correlation of Apple's stock with broader market trends support a higher probability of a price increase.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, driven by favorable inflation data meeting expectations. This positive economic backdrop generally supports a favorable market sentiment, which is likely to positively influence major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news also hints at positive earnings reports, further suggesting a likely upward trend in Apple's stock price. Although the complete news content is not accessible, the overall positive tone and market conditions support a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a favorable economic environment with US equity indexes trading close to record highs, supported by inflation data meeting expectations. This positive sentiment generally boosts confidence in major stocks like Apple Inc. (AAPL), as it tends to correlate with broader market trends. Although the specific details of Apple's performance are behind a paywall, the overall optimism in the market and the absence of negative information suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price increasing. The previous models' predictions consistently indicated optimistic probabilities for a price rise, further supporting this assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market sentiment due to US equity indexes trading near record highs and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations. This generally bodes well for large-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), which tend to follow market trends. Previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards an increased likelihood of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Given the consensus and the absence of negative company-specific news, I'm placing a slightly higher probability on the stock price increasing. However, the unavailability of the full news content introduces some uncertainty, which is reflected in the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive market environment with US equity indexes near record highs due to inflation data meeting expectations.  This generally positive market sentiment suggests a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, as it's a major component of these indexes and typically correlates with broader market trends. The lack of access to the full news article, however, introduces uncertainty.  Reviewing the previous predictions, which range from 0.6 to 0.75 for the probability of a price rise, and considering the generally positive macroeconomic context and the upward trend in predictions across rounds, I'm assigning a probability slightly higher than the average of the previous models, accounting for the uncertainty of missing details about Apple's specific performance. The risk of a price fall is acknowledged but considered less likely given the overall positive news and the consensus from several AI models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
