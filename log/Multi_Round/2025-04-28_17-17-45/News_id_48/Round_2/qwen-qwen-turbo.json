      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: All Eyes Are on the iPhone\nNews Content: Apple earnings are expected to show growth from last year, but it\u2019s iPhone demand that\u2019s still top of mind concern for investors. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to report earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $124.3 billion. In the same period last year, Apple posted EPS of $2.18 with revenue of $119.6 billion.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to last year, indicating strong underlying performance. However, investor concern centers around iPhone demand, which could impact stock performance negatively if the demand falls short of expectations. The overall sentiment from the earnings report being positive tends to suggest a likelihood of a stock price rise, but the uncertainty around iPhone demand introduces risk that could also lead to a decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive expected earnings, balanced by the risk of negative sentiment due to iPhone demand concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expected to show earnings growth year-over-year, with analysts anticipating higher EPS and revenue. This suggests positive momentum. However, the core concern revolves around iPhone demand, implying uncertainty. If the actual iPhone sales figures significantly exceed expectations, the stock is likely to rise. Conversely, if the iPhone sales are weak compared to expectations, even with overall growth, the stock could fall. Since the iPhone is such a key product for Apple, its performance is paramount. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise due to the overall growth expectation, but the iPhone demand concern keeps it from being overly optimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple is expected to report increased earnings and revenue compared to the same period last year, the market's focus remains on iPhone demand.  This suggests that the market's reaction will heavily depend on whether Apple's reported iPhone sales meet or exceed expectations. If iPhone sales are strong, the stock price is likely to rise, reflecting positive sentiment towards the company's flagship product. Conversely, if iPhone sales are weaker than anticipated, it could trigger a sell-off, even if overall earnings are better than last year.  The provided data shows a modest increase in earnings and revenue, which by itself is not overwhelmingly positive. The uncertainty around iPhone demand introduces substantial volatility. Therefore, a significant probability is assigned to both a price rise and a price fall, with a slight lean towards a price rise given the expectation of overall growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive earnings growth but uncertainty about iPhone demand\u2014creates a balanced outlook. Historically, Apple's stock reacts to both earnings beats and misses, as well as forward guidance. Given the expected growth but lingering concerns, the stock price movement is likely to be moderate, with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the earnings growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Apple's upcoming earnings report, with expectations of growth in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue compared to the same period last year. However, the concern about iPhone demand may impact investor sentiment. Given that the EPS and revenue are expected to increase, this could be perceived positively by investors. But, the top of mind concern about iPhone demand might lead to cautious or negative reactions. Overall, the positive expectations seem to outweigh the negative concerns, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth from last year, with projected earnings per share of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion. This growth suggests a positive outlook for the company. However, the top of mind concern for investors is iPhone demand, which could potentially impact the stock price if the actual demand is lower than expected. Given the expected growth in earnings and revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple is expected to report increased earnings and revenue compared to last year, which typically suggests a positive outlook for the stock. However, the concern around iPhone demand is significant, as it is a critical driver for Apple's revenue. This mixed sentiment creates uncertainty in the market, as strong overall earnings could potentially be overshadowed by disappointing iPhone sales figures. Based on the overall expected growth and recognizing the worry around iPhone demand, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with notable caution due to the associated risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a slight rise in price due to expected earnings growth. However, the significant uncertainty surrounding iPhone demand remains a critical factor. The range of previous predictions suggests a lack of strong conviction in either direction. Considering the earnings growth expectations and the market's sensitivity to iPhone performance, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect slightly less confidence in a rise, acknowledging the strong potential for a negative reaction if iPhone sales are disappointing. Also, the models in the previous rounds lack consistency, making it relatively less informative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings show growth in EPS and revenue, the significant emphasis on iPhone demand uncertainty introduces considerable risk.  The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.7 for a price rise, with the majority clustering around 0.55-0.6.  These models highlight the inherent volatility in the situation. The anticipated growth is positive, but the uncertainty around a key product like the iPhone could easily outweigh that positive sentiment if sales disappoint.  Considering the consensus of previous predictions and the inherent risk of uncertainty around iPhone demand, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the overall expected earnings growth but acknowledge the substantial probability of a price fall if iPhone sales are weaker than anticipated.  The range of previous predictions suggests a significant level of uncertainty, reflected in my own slightly more conservative estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to last year, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the primary concern is iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive earnings growth but uncertainty about iPhone demand\u2014creates a balanced outlook. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a slight probability of a rise, but with significant uncertainty due to iPhone demand, I estimate a similar probability. The overall growth expectation provides a slight edge to a price rise, but the concern around iPhone demand keeps the probabilities close.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive earnings growth but uncertainty about iPhone demand\u2014creates a balanced outlook. Given the expected growth but lingering concerns, the stock price movement is likely to be moderate, with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the earnings growth. Considering the predictions from other models, there is a general consensus of a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, with estimates ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a rise and 0.3 to 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.6 for the stock price rising and 0.4 for it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple's earnings are expected to show growth from last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, suggesting a positive outlook. However, the concern about iPhone demand introduces uncertainty. Considering the overall expected growth and the importance of iPhone sales, the stock price movement will likely be influenced by how well iPhone demand meets expectations. Given the previous predictions from other models, there's a trend towards a slight lean towards a price rise due to the overall growth expectation, but with significant consideration for the risk introduced by iPhone demand uncertainty. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a notable probability of it falling, reflecting the mixed sentiment and the critical role of iPhone demand in determining investor reaction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's expected growth in earnings and revenue compared to the previous year, driven by factors like increased EPS and revenue projections. However, investor concern remains focused on iPhone demand, which is a critical component of Apple's revenue. While the overall expected growth in the earnings report suggests a positive sentiment, the uncertainty around iPhone sales could trigger volatility. The previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the positive earnings outlook, albeit with caution regarding the iPhone demand. Considering this balance of positive and negative factors, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but with a tilt towards upward movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
