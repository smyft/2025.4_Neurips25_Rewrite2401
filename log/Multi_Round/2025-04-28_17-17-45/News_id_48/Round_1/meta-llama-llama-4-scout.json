      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: All Eyes Are on the iPhone\nNews Content: Apple earnings are expected to show growth from last year, but it\u2019s iPhone demand that\u2019s still top of mind concern for investors. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to report earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $124.3 billion. In the same period last year, Apple posted EPS of $2.18 with revenue of $119.6 billion.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple is expected to report growth in earnings and revenue compared to last year, indicating strong underlying performance. However, investor concern centers around iPhone demand, which could impact stock performance negatively if the demand falls short of expectations. The overall sentiment from the earnings report being positive tends to suggest a likelihood of a stock price rise, but the uncertainty around iPhone demand introduces risk that could also lead to a decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive expected earnings, balanced by the risk of negative sentiment due to iPhone demand concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is expected to show earnings growth year-over-year, with analysts anticipating higher EPS and revenue. This suggests positive momentum. However, the core concern revolves around iPhone demand, implying uncertainty. If the actual iPhone sales figures significantly exceed expectations, the stock is likely to rise. Conversely, if the iPhone sales are weak compared to expectations, even with overall growth, the stock could fall. Since the iPhone is such a key product for Apple, its performance is paramount. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise due to the overall growth expectation, but the iPhone demand concern keeps it from being overly optimistic.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that while Apple is expected to report increased earnings and revenue compared to the same period last year, the market's focus remains on iPhone demand.  This suggests that the market's reaction will heavily depend on whether Apple's reported iPhone sales meet or exceed expectations. If iPhone sales are strong, the stock price is likely to rise, reflecting positive sentiment towards the company's flagship product. Conversely, if iPhone sales are weaker than anticipated, it could trigger a sell-off, even if overall earnings are better than last year.  The provided data shows a modest increase in earnings and revenue, which by itself is not overwhelmingly positive. The uncertainty around iPhone demand introduces substantial volatility. Therefore, a significant probability is assigned to both a price rise and a price fall, with a slight lean towards a price rise given the expectation of overall growth.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to grow compared to last year, with projected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion, up from $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue. This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. The mixed sentiment\u2014positive earnings growth but uncertainty about iPhone demand\u2014creates a balanced outlook. Historically, Apple's stock reacts to both earnings beats and misses, as well as forward guidance. Given the expected growth but lingering concerns, the stock price movement is likely to be moderate, with a slight tilt towards a rise due to the earnings growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Apple's upcoming earnings report, with expectations of growth in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue compared to the same period last year. However, the concern about iPhone demand may impact investor sentiment. Given that the EPS and revenue are expected to increase, this could be perceived positively by investors. But, the top of mind concern about iPhone demand might lead to cautious or negative reactions. Overall, the positive expectations seem to outweigh the negative concerns, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's earnings are expected to show growth from last year, with projected earnings per share of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion. This growth suggests a positive outlook for the company. However, the top of mind concern for investors is iPhone demand, which could potentially impact the stock price if the actual demand is lower than expected. Given the expected growth in earnings and revenue, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
