Positive earnings reports generally lead to stock price increases, while disappointing reports can cause declines. The overall market sentiment derived from Q4 GDP and home sales data will also influence the stock price. Expected slower GDP growth (2.7%) is slightly concerning, but strong earnings could offset this concern. Given the anticipation around Apple's earnings and the potential for a positive surprise, along with relatively stable economic news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, while also leaving room for the possibility of price decline given GDP slowdown concerns.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
