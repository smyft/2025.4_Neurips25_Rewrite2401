A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc. is set to report its quarterly earnings, which typically has a significant impact on its stock price. Analysts often react strongly to earnings performance relative to expectations. The broader economic indicators such as GDP growth and home sales data may also impact market sentiment. However, since Apple is a strong performer historically, there is a greater chance that positive earnings could lead to a rise in its stock price. Conversely, if earnings disappoint, there might be a notable decline. Overall, there is a higher inclination towards a rise given its historical performance and market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: This news focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings release. Positive earnings reports generally lead to stock price increases, while disappointing reports can cause declines. The overall market sentiment derived from Q4 GDP and home sales data will also influence the stock price. Expected slower GDP growth (2.7%) is slightly concerning, but strong earnings could offset this concern. Given the anticipation around Apple's earnings and the potential for a positive surprise, along with relatively stable economic news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, while also leaving room for the possibility of price decline given GDP slowdown concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mentions Apple's upcoming earnings release alongside several other major companies and macroeconomic data points (GDP, home sales).  While the news itself doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's expected performance, the fact that earnings are being released creates uncertainty.  A positive earnings surprise could lead to a stock price rise, while disappointing results could cause it to fall. The macroeconomic data (GDP and home sales) could also influence investor sentiment and indirectly impact Apple's stock price, but their impact is likely to be less significant than Apple's own earnings report. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned assuming a roughly equal chance of positive and negative impacts from the earnings report, with slightly more weight given to the earnings report than general market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple (AAPL) is among several major companies scheduled to release their quarterly earnings. Earnings reports are critical events that can significantly influence stock prices, depending on whether the results meet, exceed, or fall short of market expectations. Additionally, the release of Q4 GDP data and pending home sales figures could provide broader market context, but the immediate focus will likely be on Apple's earnings. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a tendency for positive earnings surprises, but the actual outcome remains uncertain. The probabilities are estimated based on the binary outcome of earnings reports generally leading to price movements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple will release its quarterly earnings results, which can significantly impact the stock price. The article also mentions the release of Q4 GDP data and new pending home sales data, which can affect the overall market sentiment. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's earnings expectations or any potential surprises. Given the lack of specific information, it's difficult to estimate a significant movement in either direction. Therefore, I'm assigning a neutral probability to both rising and falling scenarios, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the general trend of the market and Apple's historical performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple market events and economic indicators including Apple's earnings report, GDP data, and home sales. The expected slowdown in economic growth could have mixed effects. On one hand, it might increase Apple's pressure to meet expectations. On the other, strong performance from Apple could outweigh broader economic concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
