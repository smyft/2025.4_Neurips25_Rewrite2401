(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Top Midday Stories: Charles Schwab's Adjusted Earnings Rise; Apple Q4 China Sales Reportedly Drop\nNews Content: Wall Street's major market averages were higher around midday Tuesday, the first trading day of Pres\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc.'s Q4 sales in China are reportedly dropping, which could negatively affect investor sentiment and future earnings predictions. A decline in a significant market like China can raise concerns about overall demand for Apple's products, outweighing any broader market gains that might be stimulative. Given this context, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price decline due to negative sales reports, despite the overall market being up.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline presents mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). Charles Schwab's positive earnings are largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price. However, the reported drop in Q4 China sales is a significantly negative indicator. China is a crucial market for Apple, and a sales decline there directly impacts revenue and profitability. The lack of specific details regarding the *magnitude* of the China sales drop makes it difficult to assess the precise impact, but any decline is generally viewed negatively by investors. Therefore, the negative influence is likely to outweigh any overall market positive sentiment which are not named and inaccessible beyond the title.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is partially positive and partially negative.  While Charles Schwab's positive earnings may contribute to a positive overall market sentiment, the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales is a significant negative factor specifically impacting Apple.  China is a major market for Apple, and declining sales there suggest weakening demand or increased competition. Without access to the full article detailing the extent of the sales drop, it's difficult to definitively quantify the impact. However, given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's overall performance, the negative news regarding China sales is likely to outweigh the positive general market news in terms of its effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but the probabilities are relatively close because the overall market sentiment is positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales have reportedly dropped, which could negatively impact investor sentiment and stock price. However, the broader market averages were higher, which might provide some support. The drop in China sales is a significant negative factor given China's importance to Apple's revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales reportedly dropped. This information could potentially be negative for Apple's stock price as it indicates a decline in sales in a significant market. However, the overall market averages were higher around midday, which might mitigate the negative impact. Given the specific mention of Apple's sales drop, there's a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales reportedly dropped, which could be a negative indicator for the company's stock price. This drop in sales in a significant market like China might concern investors and potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price. However, the overall market averages were higher around midday, which could suggest a positive overall market sentiment that might counterbalance the negative news about Apple's sales in China to some extent.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential decline in Apple Inc.'s sales in China for the Q4 period. Sales reports often have a strong impact on stock prices, as market participants react to changes in revenue from different regions. However, given that Apple typically has strong brand loyalty and a diverse global customer base, the immediate impact might not be severe but could still cause some investor concern.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's Q4 sales in China reportedly dropping is a significant negative factor, as China is a critical market for the company. Previous predictions largely indicate a consensus towards a negative stock price movement due to the sales decline, despite overall positive market sentiment on the trading day. The drop in sales raises concerns about overall demand for Apple's products, which significantly outweighs any potential positivity from general market trends. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment across previous rounds, all pointing to a likely stock price decrease due to the reported drop in Q4 China sales, is significant. China is a key market for Apple, and sales declines there are a major concern. The fact that all previous models, including advanced ones like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama, converged on this negative outlook strengthens the case for a price decrease. Therefore, I maintain a similar outlook, factoring in the negative news from China.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  Positive general market sentiment is mentioned, but the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales is a significant negative factor.  China is a crucial market for Apple, and a sales decline there directly impacts revenue and profitability.  The lack of specifics regarding the magnitude of the decline makes precise assessment difficult. Previous models consistently predict a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.  Considering the consensus negative sentiment toward the China sales drop and the lack of positive details beyond the general market uptick, I'm weighting the negative news more heavily.  However, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise from the previous models' predictions to account for the possibility that the market overall positive sentiment might partially offset the negative Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline reports a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant negative factor given China's importance to Apple's revenue. While the broader market averages were higher, the specific negative news about Apple's sales in a key market is likely to outweigh the general market positivity. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 for a decline. The consensus suggests that the negative impact of the China sales drop is more influential than any broader market gains. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline reports a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant negative factor for the company's stock price. Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's revenue and profitability, this decline is likely to outweigh any positive overall market sentiment. Multiple models predict a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to this negative sales report. The predicted probabilities reflect a consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise, with a higher probability assigned to a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline reports a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant negative indicator for the company's stock price. Although the overall market averages were higher, the specific mention of Apple's sales drop in a crucial market like China is likely to outweigh any positive overall market sentiment. Considering the consistent predictions from other models, which also indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to the negative sales report, I estimate a similar probability distribution. The drop in sales in China, a major market for Apple, suggests weakening demand or increased competition, which would negatively impact revenue and profitability, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential decline in Apple Inc.'s sales in China for the Q4 period. Sales reports often have a strong impact on stock prices, as market participants react to changes in revenue from different regions. Given the critical importance of China to Apple's business, the sales drop is a significant negative factor. However, it's important to note that Apple has a strong global presence and brand loyalty, which might partially mitigate the impact of the sales decline. Additionally, the overall positive trend in the broader market might offer some support.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news report indicates a drop in Apple's Q4 sales in China, a critical market for the company. This decline raises concerns about overall demand and profitability, which could negatively affect investor sentiment, outweighing the positive sentiment in broader market indices. Multiple predictive models consistently highlight a higher likelihood of a price decline due to the negative sales report. Although there is some support from a generally positive market, the gravity of decreasing sales in a key market like China leads to a consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The repeated emphasis on the negative impact of Apple's declining Q4 sales in China across previous model predictions strongly suggests a higher probability of a stock price decrease. While the broader market's positive movement might offer some counter-balance, the China sales figure is a critical concern given the region's importance to Apple's revenue. All previous rounds converged towards a negative outlook, strengthening the negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  Positive overall market sentiment is counterbalanced by the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales.  China is a crucial market for Apple; a sales decline there directly impacts revenue and profitability.  The lack of specifics regarding the magnitude of the decline makes precise assessment difficult. However, the consistent negative sentiment from previous models across multiple rounds, all pointing to a likely stock price decrease due to the reported drop in Q4 China sales, is highly significant. This consensus strengthens the case for a price decrease, outweighing the general market positivity.  I'm therefore assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the consensus view and the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's overall performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline reports a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant negative factor given China's importance to Apple's revenue.

The consensus suggests that the negative impact of the China sales drop is more influential than any broader market gains. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline reports a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant negative factor for the company's stock price.

The predicted probabilities reflect a consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise, with a higher probability assigned to a decline. Considering the consistent predictions from other models, which also indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price falling due to the negative sales report, I estimate a similar probability distribution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline reports a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant negative factor given China's importance to Apple's revenue.
