      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Top Midday Stories: Charles Schwab's Adjusted Earnings Rise; Apple Q4 China Sales Reportedly Drop\nNews Content: Wall Street's major market averages were higher around midday Tuesday, the first trading day of Pres\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reports that Apple Inc.'s Q4 sales in China are reportedly dropping, which could negatively affect investor sentiment and future earnings predictions. A decline in a significant market like China can raise concerns about overall demand for Apple's products, outweighing any broader market gains that might be stimulative. Given this context, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price decline due to negative sales reports, despite the overall market being up.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline presents mixed signals for Apple (AAPL). Charles Schwab's positive earnings are largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price. However, the reported drop in Q4 China sales is a significantly negative indicator. China is a crucial market for Apple, and a sales decline there directly impacts revenue and profitability. The lack of specific details regarding the *magnitude* of the China sales drop makes it difficult to assess the precise impact, but any decline is generally viewed negatively by investors. Therefore, the negative influence is likely to outweigh any overall market positive sentiment which are not named and inaccessible beyond the title.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is partially positive and partially negative.  While Charles Schwab's positive earnings may contribute to a positive overall market sentiment, the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales is a significant negative factor specifically impacting Apple.  China is a major market for Apple, and declining sales there suggest weakening demand or increased competition. Without access to the full article detailing the extent of the sales drop, it's difficult to definitively quantify the impact. However, given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's overall performance, the negative news regarding China sales is likely to outweigh the positive general market news in terms of its effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but the probabilities are relatively close because the overall market sentiment is positive.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales have reportedly dropped, which could negatively impact investor sentiment and stock price. However, the broader market averages were higher, which might provide some support. The drop in China sales is a significant negative factor given China's importance to Apple's revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales reportedly dropped. This information could potentially be negative for Apple's stock price as it indicates a decline in sales in a significant market. However, the overall market averages were higher around midday, which might mitigate the negative impact. Given the specific mention of Apple's sales drop, there's a higher likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple's Q4 China sales reportedly dropped, which could be a negative indicator for the company's stock price. This drop in sales in a significant market like China might concern investors and potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price. However, the overall market averages were higher around midday, which could suggest a positive overall market sentiment that might counterbalance the negative news about Apple's sales in China to some extent.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential decline in Apple Inc.'s sales in China for the Q4 period. Sales reports often have a strong impact on stock prices, as market participants react to changes in revenue from different regions. However, given that Apple typically has strong brand loyalty and a diverse global customer base, the immediate impact might not be severe but could still cause some investor concern.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
