A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline and content regarding the Nasdaq Composite Index do not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) itself or any direct impact on its operations, revenues, or market position. As a result, this information is unlikely to influence investor sentiment towards AAPL. The stock price movement is more likely to remain stable, with low probabilities assigned to significant rises or falls as a result of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?' provides general information about the Nasdaq Composite Index.

Therefore, it's unlikely to have any direct, immediate impact on Apple's stock price. A neutral effect is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article, \"What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.

Therefore, the news is unlikely to have any significant effect on AAPL's stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not have any direct impact on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) stock price.
