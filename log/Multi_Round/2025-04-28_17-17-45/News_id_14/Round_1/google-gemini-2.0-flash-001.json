The surrounding market conditions, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both up, further support a positive sentiment for stocks. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, while the likelihood of it falling remains relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates. This is generally positive news for a company, suggesting stronger-than-expected performance. Given this outperformance is happening in a time of economic uncertainty, it signals strength. Additionally, the overall market (Nasdaq and S&P 500) is up, creating a positive backdrop. While access to the full article is restricted which limits full information available, Based on the available information, I would expect a greater likelihood of the stock price increasing compared to falling. However, any overall market correction could dampen the positive effect. I'm factoring in the lack of granular information from behind the paywall to decrease confidence.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The provided news headline states that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates.  This is generally positive news for Apple and would typically be expected to drive the stock price upward. The overall market is also positive, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing gains. While the full article is unavailable, the headline alone provides strong evidence of a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However,  we should account for some uncertainty inherent in the market and the possibility of other unforeseen factors influencing the price. We will assign a higher probability to a price rise. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported fiscal Q1 results that beat estimates, which is typically a positive signal for investors. Beating estimates often leads to increased investor confidence and can result in a stock price rise. Additionally, the broader market (Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500) was up, suggesting a generally positive market sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. However, the exact impact depends on other undisclosed details in the premium content, such as guidance, margins, or other financial metrics.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is generally a positive signal for the company's stock price. The overall market trend, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%, also suggests a positive environment. Given that the news specifically highlights Apple's strong performance, it is likely that the stock price will rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline states that Apple's Fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health. This news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. Given that the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 are also up, it indicates a generally positive market sentiment, which could further support a potential increase in Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results, which is positive news for the company. Typically, such results lead to an increase in investor confidence and could potentially drive the stock price upwards. However, it's important to consider the broader market context as well, where the overall indices like Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 were also on the rise, which may suggest a general optimism in the market, possibly further boosting the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
