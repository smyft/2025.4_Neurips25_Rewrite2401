Beating estimates often leads to increased investor confidence and can result in a stock price rise. Additionally, the broader market (Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500) was up, suggesting a generally positive market sentiment. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.
