(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive news and mitigate the impact, the pre-existing negative sentiment significantly increases the chances of the stock price falling, at least in the short term. The lack of compelling AI applications also adds to the negative outlook.  The probability of a price rise is not zero, as a positive earnings surprise is possible, but the negative news significantly outweighs the potential for a positive surprise in the short term. Therefore, the likelihood of the stock price declining is considerably higher.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.8\n}\n```\n"
