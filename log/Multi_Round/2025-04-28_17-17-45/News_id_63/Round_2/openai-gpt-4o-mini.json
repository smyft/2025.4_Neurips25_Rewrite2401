(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer and the concerns over slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China indicate a bearish sentiment for Apple. The reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts suggests that analysts anticipate lower performance in the near future, compounding the negative outlook. Given these factors, combined with the expectation of slower iPhone replacement cycles and increased competition in China, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. The upcoming earnings report could also lead to increased volatility, particularly if the results do not meet lowered expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Oppenheimer's downgrade to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removal of the price target signal a lack of confidence. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market (confirmed by Canalys data of a 25% decline Q4), and the competitive landscape with generative AI add to the downside pressure. Reduced revenue and EPS forecasts indicate a pessimistic outlook. While the stock dipped 'a fraction' in morning trading, the overall negative sentiment suggests further potential downside specifically related to earnings. The upcoming earnings report is a further event for the stock's movement. Based on the news, investors are more likely to be bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", coupled with concerns about slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China (a key market), suggests a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance.  The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive news and mitigate the impact, the pre-existing negative sentiment significantly increases the chances of the stock price falling, at least in the short term. The lack of compelling AI applications also adds to the negative outlook.  The probability of a price rise is not zero, as a positive earnings surprise is possible, but the negative news significantly outweighs the potential for a positive surprise in the short term. Therefore, the likelihood of the stock price declining is considerably higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing slower iPhone sales, market share losses in China, and increased competition. The firm also reduced its revenue and EPS forecasts, pointing to weak iPhone shipments in China and slower adoption of AI features. Given these negative indicators and the timing ahead of earnings, the sentiment is bearish. However, the market may have partially priced this in, and the actual earnings report could introduce volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and weakness in China. This downgrade and the removal of the $250 price target, along with reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, are negative indicators for the stock price. Additionally, the mention of increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth further supports a negative outlook. Given that the stock dipped in morning trading following the downgrade, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports a downgrade of Apple's stock by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and market share losses in China. The investment firm reduced its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts, citing increased competition and lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks. With iPhone shipments to China declining 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024, and expectations of a slowing iPhone replacement cycle, the overall sentiment is bearish. This negative outlook, combined with the upcoming Q1 earnings report, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to concerns over slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in China. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue forecast add to the negative sentiment. The market response, as seen in the stock dipping slightly, is indicative of the negative reaction. While it's uncertain how much impact the post-market earnings release might have, current indicators suggest a bearish outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts underscore a bearish outlook for Apple. Concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in China, and increased competition contribute to negative sentiment. Historical data suggests that significant downgrades typically lead to stock price declines. Given the current sentiments expressed in prior predictions, the likelihood of a price fall seems substantially higher than that of a rise, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to add volatility. Even considering potential positive surprises, the overall negative indicators hold more weight in the current context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent negative sentiment from Oppenheimer's downgrade, citing concerns over iPhone sales, China market share, and lack of AI innovation, strongly suggests a bearish outlook. The reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts reinforces this. The previous models already pointed towards a higher probability of the stock falling, which indicates the market consensus aligns with this negative sentiment and also the validity of the negative sentiment. Therefore, with earnings imminent, while some volatility could be upward, the more likely outcome is a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Oppenheimer's downgrade, reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, and the cited decline in iPhone sales in China (a major market) paint a grim picture for Apple's short-term prospects.  The lack of compelling AI applications further exacerbates these concerns. While a positive earnings surprise is possible (and could cause a short-term rise), the pre-existing negative sentiment and the significant downward revision of expectations make a price drop far more likely in the immediate future.  The consensus from the previous models further reinforces this bearish outlook. The slight dip in morning trading is also a validating factor.  I've weighed the possibility of an earnings surprise but given the multiple negative factors, I give it a low probability of outweighing the negative news.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, coupled with concerns over slowing iPhone sales and significant market share losses in China, suggests a bearish sentiment. The reduction in revenue and EPS forecasts, along with the removal of the $250 price target, further underscores the negative outlook. Additionally, the report highlights increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks. The upcoming Q1 earnings report could introduce volatility, but the pre-existing negative sentiment and the market's reaction (minor dip in stock price) suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling. While there is a possibility of a positive earnings surprise, the overall negative indicators outweigh this potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by Oppenheimer due to slowing iPhone sales and weakness in China. This downgrade, coupled with the removal of the $250 price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts, presents a negative outlook for the company's short-term performance. The concerns about increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications further add to the downside pressure. Given that the stock dipped in morning trading following the downgrade, it is reasonable to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the near term. The consensus among various models suggests a bearish sentiment, with the probability of the stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.25 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.75.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The negative sentiment expressed by Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple's stock, coupled with concerns over slowing iPhone sales, market share losses in China, and increased competition, suggests a bearish outlook for the company's short-term performance. The reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further support this outlook. While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive news, the pre-existing negative sentiment and the decline in iPhone shipments to China significantly increase the chances of the stock price falling. The lack of compelling AI applications also adds to the negative outlook. Considering the consensus among previous predictions, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, it's reasonable to infer that the negative news outweighs the potential for a positive surprise in the short term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer, concern over slowing iPhone sales, and significant market share losses in China. The revenue and EPS forecasts have been reduced, which reinforces the bearish sentiment. Previous predictions from multiple models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these factors. Although there remains a small probability of an unexpected positive development during the post-market earnings release, the overall negative outlook strongly suggests that the stock price is more likely to fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
