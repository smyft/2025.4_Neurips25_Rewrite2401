      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\nNews Content: When Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, the stakes are particularly high. 1. At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials. Wall Street analysts see only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales from a year before, so it may mean another year of low iPhone growth, like in fiscal 2022 through 2024.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The earnings report is highly anticipated, and given the low expected growth in iPhone sales, there are concerns about future revenue generation. Analysts' expectations of only a 1.4% increase in iPhone sales suggest potential disappointment among investors, which could lead to a decrease in stock price. However, there may be other positive factors that could offset this sentiment, such as new product launches or services growth. Hence, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price fall compared to a more balanced chance of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report with an emphasis on iPhone sales. The key takeaway is the projected low iPhone growth (1.4%), signaling a continuation of weak performance similar to the past few years. While the article provides only a snippet, the mention of 'high stakes' and 'low growth' suggests a cautious or even slightly negative outlook. The probability estimates are based on this cautious tone, considering that iPhone sales are crucial for Apple's overall financial health. Though the complete article could discuss compensating positive outcomes, the initial piece leads to a conservative perspective.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Wall Street analysts predict only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, a key driver of Apple's revenue (representing half of total revenue in fiscal 2024). This low growth projection, following a period of similar low growth in fiscal years 2022-2024, suggests a potential for disappointment if the actual results fall short of expectations or even slightly meet the low forecast.  Investors may react negatively to underwhelming iPhone sales figures, potentially leading to a stock price decline. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and overall strong financial position could mitigate this negative impact to some degree.  Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, though the impact is likely to be moderate, not extreme.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple's iPhone sales, which account for half of its total revenue, are expected to grow only 1.4% annually, similar to the low growth seen in previous years. This suggests stagnation in a key revenue driver, which could disappoint investors and lead to negative sentiment. Given the market's focus on growth, the modest iPhone sales projection may weigh on the stock price. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and other potential positive surprises in the earnings report could mitigate some downside risk. Overall, the news leans slightly negative but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's earnings report may not meet high expectations, particularly with iPhone sales projected to have only a 1.4% annual increase. This low growth projection could lead to a negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower compared to the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report, highlighting the importance of iPhone sales, which account for half of the company's total revenue. With Wall Street analysts predicting only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales, this may indicate another year of low iPhone growth. This moderate growth expectation could lead to a neutral or slightly negative reaction from investors, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and loyal customer base might mitigate the impact, making a significant stock price drop less likely. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that iPhone sales are crucial for Apple's performance, with an expected only slight increase. This low growth outlook might disappoint investors who are looking for strong revenue and growth indicators. The modest projected growth could pressure the stock price negatively, given that iPhone represents half the company's revenue.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
