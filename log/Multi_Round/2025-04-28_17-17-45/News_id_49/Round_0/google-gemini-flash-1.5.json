This low growth projection, following a period of similar low growth in fiscal years 2022-2024, suggests a potential for disappointment if the actual results fall short of expectations or even slightly meet the low forecast.  Investors may react negatively to underwhelming iPhone sales figures, potentially leading to a stock price decline. However, Apple's diversified product portfolio and overall strong financial position could mitigate this negative impact to some degree.  Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, though the impact is likely to be moderate, not extreme.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```\n"
