(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\nNews Content: When Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, the stakes are particularly high. 1. At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials.

Analysts' expectations of only a 1.4% increase in iPhone sales suggest potential disappointment among investors, which could lead to a decrease in stock price. However, there may be other positive factors that could offset this sentiment, such as new product launches or services growth.
