(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\nNews Content: When Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, the stakes are particularly high. 1. At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials. Wall Street analysts see only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales from a year before, so it may mean another year of low iPhone growth, like in fiscal 2022 through 2024.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This suggests stagnation in a key revenue driver, which could disappoint investors and lead to negative sentiment. Given the market's focus on growth, the modest iPhone sales projection may weigh on the stock price. However, Apple's diversified product ecosystem and other potential positive surprises in the earnings report could mitigate some downside risk.
