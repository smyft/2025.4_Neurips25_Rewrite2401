A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer may lead to negative sentiment around Apple's stock, especially ahead of earnings where expectations can be critical. The mention of competition in China and a lack of innovative AI features suggests potential challenges to growth. Consequently, these factors could result in a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising as investors process this downgrade.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a negative sentiment due to the downgrade by Oppenheimer. The reasons cited include competition in China, which is a significant market for Apple, and the perceived lack of compelling AI features, a key area of focus for investors currently. While an earnings report is forthcoming and could potentially offset this negative sentiment if results are strong, a downgrade immediately preceding the earnings report introduces uncertainty. The absence of positive catalysts in the immediate news and inclusion of negative drivers contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term, specifically until the market reaction to the earnings result clarifies the direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Oppenheimer's downgrade of Apple from Outperform to Perform is a negative catalyst.  The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are both significant concerns for investors.  China is a crucial market for Apple, and the AI race is heating up, putting pressure on Apple to innovate. While Apple's earnings report will be crucial in determining the actual market reaction, the downgrade itself suggests a bearish sentiment from a prominent analyst firm.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term, though the magnitude of the fall is uncertain and will depend heavily on the earnings report.  It's important to remember that these probabilities are estimates based on limited information and market sentiment can change rapidly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple Inc. being downgraded by Oppenheimer due to competition in China and lack of compelling AI features is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment. Analyst downgrades typically lead to a decrease in stock price as they may influence investor decisions and reduce confidence in the stock. Given that this downgrade comes just ahead of earnings, it may amplify concerns about the company's performance and future prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. A downgrade by a reputable analyst firm typically has a negative impact on the stock price as it may reflect a decrease in confidence in the company's future performance. Given that the downgrade is ahead of the earnings report, it could set a negative tone for investors and potentially lead to a decrease in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of Apple being downgraded by Oppenheimer analysts to Perform from Outperform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features, is likely to have a negative impact on the stock price. This downgrade, especially just ahead of earnings, may heighten investor concerns about Apple's competitiveness and growth prospects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has been downgraded by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Downgrades often lead to a decrease in investor confidence, which can put downward pressure on the stock price. This is especially true when it comes from a major analyst firm like Oppenheimer. Furthermore, this downgrade comes right before Apple's earnings report, adding extra caution for investors who might wait to see the earnings report before deciding to make any moves. Hence, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' suggests a bearish sentiment regarding Apple's outlook, particularly citing competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically decrease investor confidence, especially just before an earnings report where expectations can be pivotal. Given the prevailing concerns amplified by the downgrade, it seems reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds strongly leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the Oppenheimer downgrade. The reasons cited - competition in China and lack of compelling AI, coupled with the timing just before earnings - increase the likelihood of a fall. The consistent predictions of a 0.7 or 0.8 probability of a fall reflect this bearish sentiment. While earnings could present an upside surprise, the immediate market reaction to the downgrade is expected to be negative. Given that and the lack of any real contrarian indicator from previous predictions, I will shade only modestly differently from the consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The Oppenheimer downgrade is a significant negative catalyst.  The justifications \u2013 increased competition in China and lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are valid concerns impacting Apple's future growth potential. Although the earnings report could potentially offset some of the negative sentiment, the pre-earnings downgrade creates considerable uncertainty, increasing the likelihood of a short-term price decrease. The consensus from previous models also leans heavily towards a price drop, which I weigh significantly in this prediction. While there's always a chance for a positive surprise in the earnings report, the immediate impact of the downgrade is likely to lead to a drop.  The probability of a price rise is reduced by the significant negative sentiment surrounding the downgrade.  Therefore, using previous predictions as a weighting factor, the higher probability remains on the stock price falling, but adjusted slightly upward from the previous predictions due to the possibility of positive news in the upcoming earnings report. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' is a significant negative signal, especially given the timing just ahead of the earnings report. The reasons cited\u2014competition in China and lack of compelling AI features\u2014are substantial concerns that could dampen investor sentiment. Analyst downgrades often lead to a decrease in stock price as they can influence investor confidence and perception of the company's future performance. The consensus from previous predictions also leans heavily towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, while there is always some uncertainty and potential for positive surprises in the earnings report, the immediate impact of the downgrade suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features, is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. This downgrade comes ahead of the earnings report, which can be a critical event for stock performance. Historically, analyst downgrades have led to decreased investor confidence and potential declines in stock price. The reasons mentioned, such as competition in China and the perceived lack of AI innovation, are significant concerns for investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news of Apple Inc. being downgraded by Oppenheimer due to competition in China and lack of compelling AI features is likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment. Analyst downgrades typically lead to a decrease in stock price as they may influence investor decisions and reduce confidence in the stock. Given that this downgrade comes just ahead of earnings, it may amplify concerns about the company's performance and future prospects. The previous predictions by other models also indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average prediction of around 0.7 for the probability of the stock price falling. Considering these factors, I estimate a similar probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing significant challenges including intense competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features. These concerns are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment, especially given the proximity to the earnings report. Historical analyst predictions suggest a strong inclination towards the stock price declining, reflecting the cautious outlook due to the recent downgrade.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
