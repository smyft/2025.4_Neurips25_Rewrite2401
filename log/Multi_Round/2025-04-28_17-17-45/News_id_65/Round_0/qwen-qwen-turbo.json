Downgrades often lead to a decrease in investor confidence, which can put downward pressure on the stock price. This is especially true when it comes from a major analyst firm like Oppenheimer. Furthermore, this downgrade comes right before Apple's earnings report, adding extra caution for investors who might wait to see the earnings report before deciding to make any moves. Hence, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of stock price decline.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.8\n}"
