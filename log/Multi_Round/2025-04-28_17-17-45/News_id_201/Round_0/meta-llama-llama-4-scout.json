The phrasing implies a sense of urgency or opportunity, which could be interpreted positively by investors. However, without specific details about the event or announcement, the impact is uncertain. Historically, such headlines can lead to increased volatility but often result in a short-term positive reaction if the event meets or exceeds investor expectations. Given the neutral to potentially positive tone, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
