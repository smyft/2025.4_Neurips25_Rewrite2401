While Apple is not explicitly mentioned as one of the two AI stocks Buffett invested in, the investment indirectly suggests confidence in the broader AI sector. Considering Apple's significant involvement in AI development and integration into their products (even though they're not *pure play*), Buffett's bet lends credibility and positive sentiment to the AI sector, which *can* positively impact companies like Apple who also incorporate heavy AI into their tech. But given that there is no *direct* mention of Apple, the positive price movement would be somewhat limited. Therefore, while the probability of a rise exists, it is not exceedingly high. Alternatively if the AI stocks that Warren Buffett invested in are direct competitors to Apple, this news could have a slightly negative impact on Apple's Stock. However, as the title implies that Buffett is investing in the AI space, this may create a positive impact due to the increase in general interest.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.60,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.40\n}\n```"
