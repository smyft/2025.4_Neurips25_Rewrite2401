While Apple Inc. is not directly mentioned in the news, it is known for its innovations in AI and technology. Increased interest and investment in AI could positively affect tech stocks including Apple. However, since the focus is primarily on Berkshire Hathaway's investments, which do not include Apple, the impact might be limited. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to overall positive sentiment in the AI sector, but tempered by uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
