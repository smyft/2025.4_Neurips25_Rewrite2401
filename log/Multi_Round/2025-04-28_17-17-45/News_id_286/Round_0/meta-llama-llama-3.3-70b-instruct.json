Although the article does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. as one of the AI stocks, it implies that AI-focused companies are gaining attention from prominent investors. Apple Inc., being a major player in the tech industry and having its own AI-related initiatives, might benefit from the increased interest in AI stocks. However, since Apple is not directly mentioned in the article, the impact on its stock price may be indirect. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards AI stocks and potential spill-over effects, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
