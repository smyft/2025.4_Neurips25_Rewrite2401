      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, suggesting a conservative approach in contrast to increasing investments seen in other major tech companies. This could be viewed negatively, as investors might be concerned about Apple's ability to compete in the rapidly evolving AI sector. However, if investors believe that Apple's strategy conservatively manages risk and focuses on sustainability rather than a potentially unwise spending spree, the impact could be neutral. Overall, there are more indications of potential negative sentiment due to the perception of underinvestment in a critical technology area.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is taking a cautious approach to AI spending compared to its peers, specifically mentioning Meta's massive investment. While the headline uses the word 'Muted,' which could be interpreted negatively, the text also includes 'DeepSeek Validates the Approach,' which implies a potential positive validation of Apple's less aggressive AI spending strategy. The market's reaction will depend on whether investors perceive Apple's approach as prudent and sustainable or as falling behind in a crucial technology race. Given the ambiguous nature of the news and the positive validation mentioned, I slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, but the validation tempers the potential negative impact. The overall sentiment will likely be driven by investor perception on whether Apple's understated spending is strategic or a sign of lagging in AI innovation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's massive planned expenditure, could put pressure on Apple to increase its own AI investment eventually. The overall market sentiment towards AI and the tech sector will also play a significant role. Given the mixed signals and the existing strength of Apple, a significant negative impact is unlikely.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong brand and existing market position, but the uncertainty makes a sharp move in either direction less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is heavily investing in AI. While this might suggest Apple is lagging in AI innovation, the article mentions that DeepSeek 'validates the approach,' indicating that Apple's strategy might still be sound. Investors could react in two ways: negatively, viewing Apple as falling behind in a key tech race, or positively, seeing cost discipline and a different strategic focus. However, given the market's current emphasis on AI dominance, the perceived lack of aggressive investment might weigh more heavily.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's approach to AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, implying that Apple's muted spending on AI might be a strategic or validated choice rather than a shortcoming. However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers on AI, which could be perceived as a potential disadvantage in a rapidly evolving tech landscape where AI is becoming increasingly important. The overall impact on the stock price depends on investors' perception of whether Apple's current strategy is beneficial or detrimental to its future growth. Given that the news does not introduce any overtly negative information about Apple's financials or operations but rather frames its spending as a potentially wise strategy, the probability of the stock price rising could be slightly higher than falling. However, the difference in probabilities might not be very large as the long-term implications of AI investments are complex and subject to various factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple's spending on artificial intelligence is muted compared to its peers, with some companies like Meta planning to invest heavily in AI. This could be perceived as a negative for Apple, as it may be seen as not investing enough in a key area of technology. However, the validation from DeepSeek may indicate that Apple's approach is still effective, which could mitigate the negative impact. Overall, the news is likely to have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the effect may be limited due to the validation from DeepSeek.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, which may be interpreted negatively by investors concerned about the company's competitiveness in a key technological area. However, the validation from DeepSeek suggests that this conservative spending approach could be a strategic decision aimed at risk management rather than an indication of falling behind. The mixed signals in the news, with the emphasis on fiscal responsibility juxtaposed with the potential implications of underinvestment in AI, lead to a slightly negative sentiment overall. The previous predictions from various models reflect this uncertainty, with probabilities skewed slightly towards a stock price drop. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline while acknowledging that a significant drop is unlikely due to Apple's strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. On one hand, its AI spending is lower than competitors like Meta, which could be seen negatively. However, the validation from DeepSeek offers a counterpoint, suggesting Apple's approach might be strategic. The previous rounds show a varied sentiment, oscillating between slightly negative to neutral, with some even leaning slightly positive due to the validation aspect. Given the conflicting signals and the uncertainty reflected in previous predictions, I'm sticking to a slightly negative outlook, but not overwhelmingly so, especially since AI spending is a long-term investment and validation might bring in support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture. While Apple's lower AI spending compared to competitors like Meta could be seen negatively, suggesting a potential lag in a crucial technological area,  the mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach introduces a counter-narrative.  The previous predictions are also varied, highlighting the ambiguity of the situation.  The positive validation from DeepSeek tempers the potential negative impact of the lower spending.  Apple's strong brand and established market position also provide a buffer against significant negative price movement.  Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a neutral to slightly positive outcome seems most likely.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to DeepSeek's validation and Apple's overall market strength, but significant movement in either direction appears unlikely given the lack of concrete negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, which could be viewed negatively as it might suggest Apple is lagging in a critical technology area. However, the validation by DeepSeek offers a counterpoint, suggesting that Apple's approach may be strategically sound. Previous predictions show a split in sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative impact (higher probability of stock price falling) due to perceived underinvestment, while others see potential positivity in Apple's disciplined spending. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market focus on AI, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, given the current emphasis on aggressive AI investment in the tech sector.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, which could be viewed negatively as it may suggest Apple is falling behind in the AI race. However, DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could mitigate this negative perception by implying that Apple's strategy is sound and potentially more sustainable. The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh the importance of AI investment against fiscal responsibility. Given the mixed signals and Apple's strong market position, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but the overall uncertainty keeps the probabilities relatively close.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, which could be perceived as a negative. However, the validation from DeepSeek suggests that Apple's approach may be strategic and effective. Considering the mixed signals and the existing strength of Apple, the probability of a significant negative impact is unlikely. The market's reaction will depend on whether investors perceive Apple's approach as prudent and sustainable or as falling behind in a crucial technology race. Based on the analysis of the news and the predictions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's less aggressive stance on artificial intelligence compared to its peers, particularly Meta. However, the validation from DeepSeek on Apple's approach suggests that Apple's strategy could be considered sound and prudent. Multiple models have varied opinions, some perceiving this as positive due to fiscal responsibility and strategic focus, while others see it as a potential disadvantage in a fast-evolving tech sector. Overall, there seems to be a balanced viewpoint with some indication of minor market concerns, but Apple's strong fundamentals could mitigate negative sentiments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
