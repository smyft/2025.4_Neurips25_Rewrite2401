      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue. DeepSeek Validates the Approach.\nNews Content: Apple continues to spend less than its Magnificent 7 peers on artificial intelligence. American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more. Facebook parent Meta Platforms said last week that Meta is planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year while significantly increasing the size of the company\u2019s AI teams.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers, suggesting a conservative approach in contrast to increasing investments seen in other major tech companies. This could be viewed negatively, as investors might be concerned about Apple's ability to compete in the rapidly evolving AI sector. However, if investors believe that Apple's strategy conservatively manages risk and focuses on sustainability rather than a potentially unwise spending spree, the impact could be neutral. Overall, there are more indications of potential negative sentiment due to the perception of underinvestment in a critical technology area.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple is taking a cautious approach to AI spending compared to its peers, specifically mentioning Meta's massive investment. While the headline uses the word 'Muted,' which could be interpreted negatively, the text also includes 'DeepSeek Validates the Approach,' which implies a potential positive validation of Apple's less aggressive AI spending strategy. The market's reaction will depend on whether investors perceive Apple's approach as prudent and sustainable or as falling behind in a crucial technology race. Given the ambiguous nature of the news and the positive validation mentioned, I slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, but the validation tempers the potential negative impact. The overall sentiment will likely be driven by investor perception on whether Apple's understated spending is strategic or a sign of lagging in AI innovation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is spending less on AI than its competitors. While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's massive planned expenditure, could put pressure on Apple to increase its own AI investment eventually. The overall market sentiment towards AI and the tech sector will also play a significant role. Given the mixed signals and the existing strength of Apple, a significant negative impact is unlikely.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong brand and existing market position, but the uncertainty makes a sharp move in either direction less probable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple is spending less on AI compared to its peers like Meta, which is heavily investing in AI. While this might suggest Apple is lagging in AI innovation, the article mentions that DeepSeek 'validates the approach,' indicating that Apple's strategy might still be sound. Investors could react in two ways: negatively, viewing Apple as falling behind in a key tech race, or positively, seeing cost discipline and a different strategic focus. However, given the market's current emphasis on AI dominance, the perceived lack of aggressive investment might weigh more heavily.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's approach to AI spending is validated by DeepSeek, implying that Apple's muted spending on AI might be a strategic or validated choice rather than a shortcoming. However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers on AI, which could be perceived as a potential disadvantage in a rapidly evolving tech landscape where AI is becoming increasingly important. The overall impact on the stock price depends on investors' perception of whether Apple's current strategy is beneficial or detrimental to its future growth. Given that the news does not introduce any overtly negative information about Apple's financials or operations but rather frames its spending as a potentially wise strategy, the probability of the stock price rising could be slightly higher than falling. However, the difference in probabilities might not be very large as the long-term implications of AI investments are complex and subject to various factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple's spending on artificial intelligence is muted compared to its peers, with some companies like Meta planning to invest heavily in AI. This could be perceived as a negative for Apple, as it may be seen as not investing enough in a key area of technology. However, the validation from DeepSeek may indicate that Apple's approach is still effective, which could mitigate the negative impact. Overall, the news is likely to have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the effect may be limited due to the validation from DeepSeek.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
