While some might view this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race, others may interpret it as a sign of fiscal responsibility and a focus on profitability rather than excessive investment in a still-developing field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach could further support this positive interpretation.  However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's massive planned expenditure, could put pressure on Apple to increase its own AI investment eventually. The overall market sentiment towards AI and the tech sector will also play a significant role. Given the mixed signals and the existing strength of Apple, a significant negative impact is unlikely.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to Apple's strong brand and existing market position, but the uncertainty makes a sharp move in either direction less probable.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
