American tech companies have spent billions of dollars on developing generative artificial intelligence projects, with plans to spend much more.

While the headline uses the word 'Muted,' which could be interpreted negatively, the text also includes 'DeepSeek Validates the Approach,' which implies a potential positive validation of Apple's less aggressive AI spending strategy. The market's reaction will depend on whether investors perceive Apple's approach as prudent and sustainable or as falling behind in a crucial technology race. Given the ambiguous nature of the news and the positive validation mentioned, I slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, but the validation tempers the potential negative impact. The overall sentiment will likely be driven by investor perception on whether Apple's understated spending is strategic or a sign of lagging in AI innovation.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
