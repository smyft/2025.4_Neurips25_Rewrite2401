However, the article also highlights that Apple is spending less than its peers on AI, which could be perceived as a potential disadvantage in a rapidly evolving tech landscape where AI is becoming increasingly important. The overall impact on the stock price depends on investors' perception of whether Apple's current strategy is beneficial or detrimental to its future growth. Given that the news does not introduce any overtly negative information about Apple's financials or operations but rather frames its spending as a potentially wise strategy, the probability of the stock price rising could be slightly higher than falling. However, the difference in probabilities might not be very large as the long-term implications of AI investments are complex and subject to various factors.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
