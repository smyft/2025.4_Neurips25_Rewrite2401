(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content as one of the stocks. Given that AAPL is already a large-cap company and a leader in AI integration through its products like Siri, Apple Intelligence, and others, the optimistic forecast for other AI stocks may not directly impact AAPL's stock price significantly. The lack of direct mention and specific catalysts in the news for AAPL suggests a neutral to slightly positive bias based on overall market sentiment and potential indirect benefits from the AI sector growth.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
