      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses AI stocks and mentions a potential capitalization of $4 trillion by 2025. Although Apple is not explicitly mentioned as one of the '2 AI stocks,' it is a significant player in technology and AI integration. This can create positive sentiment around Apple's stock, given its historical performance in tech innovation and investments in AI. However, since the focus of the news is not directly on Apple, there might be limited direct impact. Overall, I estimate a slightly higher probability of price rise due to the optimistic nature of the news regarding AI's future, but there is also a possibility of uncertainty leading to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights AI stocks potentially soaring. While Apple may benefit from the general positive sentiment around AI, the article doesn't explicitly state Apple is one of the two mentioned stocks, nor does it firmly link Apple to the AI stock market. This makes the impact on AAPL uncertain and any movement based on speculation. Therefore, the impact would likely be minimal. It is also possible that AI stocks may rise to `$4 trillion in value by 2025`, but this doesn't necessarily translate to rapid and substantial change to AAPL short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but Apple (AAPL) is not one of them.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other factors such as overall market sentiment, Apple's own earnings reports, product announcements, etc.  We assume a neutral stance, with the probability of a rise and fall being equal to the baseline probability based on general market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an AI stock, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth potential by 2025. Positive analyst predictions, especially those highlighting transformative technologies like AI, often lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity. Given Apple's strong brand, market position, and ongoing investments in AI, this news is likely to be perceived favorably by the market. However, the actual impact on the stock price will depend on broader market conditions and investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests buying two AI stocks before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content as one of the stocks. Given that AAPL is already a large-cap company and a leader in AI integration through its products like Siri, Apple Intelligence, and others, the optimistic forecast for other AI stocks may not directly impact AAPL's stock price significantly. The lack of direct mention and specific catalysts in the news for AAPL suggests a neutral to slightly positive bias based on overall market sentiment and potential indirect benefits from the AI sector growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This implies a positive outlook for the company's future growth and potential in the AI sector. As a result, it is likely that investors will react positively to this news, leading to an increase in the stock price. The mention of a specific and significant growth target ($4 trillion) adds credibility to the analyst's prediction, further supporting the likelihood of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

There is speculation about the potential positive impact on stock prices of AI stocks, and while Apple is a major player in technology and AI integration, the news does not directly correlate to the company's stock.
