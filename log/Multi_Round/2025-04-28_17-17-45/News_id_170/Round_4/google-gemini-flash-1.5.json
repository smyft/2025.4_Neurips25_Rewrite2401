(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games kicks off plan to add third-party games to own mobile store\nNews Content: (Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.\n\nThe videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.\n\nEpic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.\n\nIt will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as \"Bloons TD 6\" and \"Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee\".\n\nThe company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.\n\n\"We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,\" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.\n\nThe company also offers a computer graphics software, called \"Unreal Engine\", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.\n\nApple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.\n\nAfter getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's \"Fortnite\" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.\n\n($1 = 0.9598 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' initiative to add third-party games to its mobile store, potentially creating more competition for the Apple App Store. This could impact Apple's revenue from app store fees, especially if users prefer Epic's store to avoid these charges. However, the long-term effect on Apple cannot be fully determined yet, as it depends on user adoption of the new marketplace. Given that Apple's existing app ecosystem is robust, the immediate impact on AAPL's stock price may be limited, leading to a slightly higher probability of stock price stability rather than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: This news indicates a moderate negative impact on Apple's stock price. Epic Games' expansion into mobile app distribution, particularly within the EU where Apple is now compelled to allow alternate app stores, directly challenges Apple's App Store dominance and revenue streams. While the initial impact might be small (Epic missed its user target), the long-term effect could be substantial as other competitors emerge, eroding Apple's commission earnings and control over the iOS ecosystem. The news that Fortnite returned to iPhones in the EU might bring some counterbalance because of users who will use iPhones and buy in-app purchases, but it is unlikely to change the overall trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally, while temporarily subsidizing Apple's fees for developers, is largely neutral for Apple.  While it increases competition in the mobile app store market, the impact on Apple's App Store revenue is likely to be small in the short term. Epic Games' mobile store has significantly fewer users than Apple's App Store, and Apple only needs to accept a revenue share on games exceeding 1 million installs. Apple's existing dominant market share mitigates any significant threat from Epic's initiative. Apple's business extends far beyond app store revenues, and this news is unlikely to be a major driver of significant price movement either up or down.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted more towards a neutral outcome, with slightly higher probability of a minor negative impact given the increased competition, although it's unlikely to be significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' plan to add third-party games to its own mobile store, which challenges Apple's App Store dominance, particularly in the EU. This could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store fees, as Epic Games is offering alternatives and even covering some fees for developers. However, the impact might be limited as Epic Games' mobile store has not yet reached its target user base, and Apple's ecosystem remains strong. The direct financial impact on Apple is uncertain but likely negative in the short term due to potential revenue loss.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially reducing Apple's commission fees through alternative in-app purchases could be seen as a negative development for Apple Inc. (AAPL). This is because Epic Games' actions might set a precedent for other developers to bypass Apple's App Store, potentially reducing Apple's revenue from commissions. However, it's worth noting that this development is specific to the European Union and might not have a significant immediate impact on Apple's overall business. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower due to the potential long-term threat to Apple's business model, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher due to the perceived negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Epic Games' decision to add third-party games to its own mobile store, including on Apple's iOS in the European Union, could potentially compete with Apple's App Store and reduce its revenue from commission fees. However, the immediate impact might be limited due to the small catalog of games initially offered and the specific regional focus. Apple had already approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe, suggesting a level of acceptance or compliance with regulatory pressures. The competition could lead to a slight decrease in Apple's stock price, but the overall effect is likely to be minimal given Apple's diverse revenue streams and the gradual nature of Epic's expansion.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile game store, offering third-party games, and bypassing Apple's and Google's fee structures. This may pose a competitive threat to Apple's App Store revenue, as users might opt for alternative platforms. However, it is important to consider that Apple has already approved Epic's marketplace app in Europe, suggesting some level of collaboration. The overall impact on Apple's stock price may be limited, given the existing competitive landscape and user preferences.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a plan to add third-party games to its mobile store indicates a growing competitive threat to Apple's App Store, particularly in the European Union where regulatory changes have already allowed alternative app stores. While this competition could impact Apple's revenue from app store fees, especially if users choose Epic's platform to avoid high commissions, the immediate financial implications may be limited. Apple maintains a substantial market share and revenue streams beyond the App Store, suggesting that while there might be a slight negative effect on the stock price, the overall impact could be mitigated by Apple's strong ecosystem. Most analysts lean towards a bearish outlook but acknowledge that the threat is not immediate and Apple's position remains robust. Therefore, the probabilities are skewed towards a slight increase in the likelihood of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates a moderate negative impact on Apple's stock. Epic Games' move to expand its mobile game store, particularly in the EU, directly challenges Apple's app store model and revenue stream. While Epic's user base is currently smaller, the long-term effect could grow, eroding Apple's commission earnings. The return of Fortnite on iPhones in the EU provides a minor counterbalance, potentially leading to some in-app purchase revenue. However, the overall trend favors a negative impact. Given the consensus sentiment from previous predictions leaning towards a negative impact, I will adjust my prediction accordingly, but slightly less bearish given the potential Fortnite effect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store presents a nuanced challenge to Apple. While it introduces competition and potentially reduces Apple's App Store revenue, the impact is likely to be gradual and limited in the short term.  Epic Games' market share is currently small, and Apple's approval of the Epic Games marketplace app in Europe suggests a degree of accommodation to regulatory pressures.  The temporary fee subsidy offered by Epic further minimizes immediate impact.  Moreover, Apple's revenue streams extend far beyond App Store fees. Considering the previous predictions, which largely lean towards a slight negative impact or neutral outcome with probabilities ranging from 0.15 to 0.7 for a price drop and 0.15 to 0.4 for a price rise, I've chosen a conservative estimate that reflects the potential for minor negative impact but emphasizes the limitations of the current threat.  The overall robust state of Apple's business mitigates the potential for significant stock price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store and adding third-party games, particularly in the EU, poses a potential competitive threat to Apple's App Store revenue. This could lead to a reduction in Apple's commission fees, which is a significant revenue stream. However, the immediate impact may be limited due to the small initial catalog and regional focus. Apple's robust ecosystem and existing market dominance mitigate some of the negative effects. Previous predictions suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the competitive threat, albeit with some uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store, particularly on Apple's iOS in the European Union, presents a competitive threat to Apple's App Store. By offering alternative games and avoiding Apple's fees, Epic Games could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions. However, the impact might be limited due to the small initial catalog of games and the specific regional focus. Additionally, Apple's diverse revenue streams and strong ecosystem could mitigate the negative effects. Considering these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower, while the probability of it falling is higher, but not drastically so due to the contained nature of the threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store and adding third-party games, particularly within the EU where Apple is compelled to allow alternate app stores, directly challenges Apple's App Store dominance and revenue streams. However, the initial impact might be small due to Epic missing its user target and Apple's existing app ecosystem being robust. Considering the diverse range of predictions provided, which generally lean towards a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock due to increased competition but acknowledge the potential for limited immediate effect, the probabilities are estimated with a slight bias towards a negative outcome but with a significant weight on stability or minimal movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Epic Games' efforts to expand its mobile game store and attract third-party developers. This initiative introduces more competition to the mobile app marketplace, which could impact Apple's App Store revenue. However, considering that Epic Games is starting with a modest catalog of games and the approval by Apple for its marketplace app in Europe, it suggests some level of acceptance or compliance. Additionally, Apple's diversified revenue streams further mitigate the immediate impact. Despite the long-term implications of increased competition, the current news may not significantly alter investor sentiment in the short term.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile store introduces a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, specifically in the European Union, where regulatory pressures allow alternative app stores. While Apple's robust ecosystem and significant market share mitigate the immediate financial impacts, the introduction of competition may gradually erode Apple's commission earnings in the long term. Most previous predictions reflect a bearish outlook, with many analysts emphasizing the potential for a minor negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for a stock price fall, albeit with a more limited immediate effect on Apple's overall financial performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Epic Games' expansion into the mobile game store market, particularly within the EU, continues to pose a competitive threat to Apple's App Store and its associated revenue streams. The previous round of predictions leaned towards a slightly negative impact, factoring in Apple's robust ecosystem and diverse revenue streams as mitigating factors. However, the continued expansion of Epic's store and its strategies, such as covering the core technology fees for developers, might incentivize more developers to participate, potentially increasing the competitive pressure on Apple. Also note that from rount 0 to rount 1, the others' predictions had an overall bearish trend, even though the range became smaller. Taking these into consideration, I am increasing the probability of fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store presents a long-term competitive threat to Apple's App Store, but the immediate impact is likely to be minimal.  Epic Games' current user base is significantly smaller than Apple's, and Apple has already approved Epic's app store in Europe, suggesting a degree of accommodation or perhaps anticipation of this development.  While the potential for reduced App Store revenue exists, particularly in Europe, Apple's diverse revenue streams and overall market dominance mitigate the risk of a significant stock price drop. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a slight negative impact or a neutral outcome, with probabilities for a price drop ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 and probabilities for a price rise ranging from 0.25 to 0.4.  Considering this range and the relatively limited immediate impact of the news, a probability of stock price fall slightly higher than the probability of a rise is the most reasonable estimate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store and adding third-party games, particularly in the EU, introduces a competitive threat to Apple's App Store. This could potentially reduce Apple's revenue from app store commissions, which is a significant revenue stream. However, the immediate impact may be limited due to the small initial catalog of games and regional focus. Apple's robust ecosystem and market dominance mitigate some of the negative effects. Previous predictions also lean towards a slight negative impact, acknowledging the competitive threat but noting the potential for limited immediate effect.

However, considering the small initial catalog, regional focus, and Apple's robust ecosystem, the immediate impact may be limited. Previous predictions suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the competitive threat, but with some uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact.

While there is significant market concern about potential revenue loss from app store fees, the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely minimal due to its robust ecosystem and substantial market share. However, the possibility of long-term erosion of Apple's commission earnings cannot be ignored, leading to a bearish sentiment reflected in previous predictions. The overall consensus suggests a higher probability of stock price decline, albeit with limited immediate repercussions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Epic Games' expansion, particularly in the EU, intensifies the competitive pressure on Apple's App Store. The previous rounds consistently leaned towards a negative impact, acknowledging Apple's strength but also recognizing the potential for long-term erosion of commission revenue. The trend in previous predictions shows a move toward a more bearish outlook. While Apple's diversified revenue and robust ecosystem offer some protection, Epic's strategies to attract developers by subsidizing fees could amplify the competitive threat. Given the consistent bearish sentiment and the increasing downward adjustments made in previous rounds, I am placing a higher probability on a stock price fall. Note that Apple has already approved Epic's marketplace app, which suggests that it has anticipated and integrated it into their strategy, mitigating some of the negatives brought about by Epic's expansion.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store presents a nuanced situation for Apple. While it introduces competition and potentially reduces Apple's App Store revenue, the impact is likely to be gradual and limited in the short term.

Considering this range, the trend towards a bearish outlook, and the relatively limited immediate impact of the news, a probability of stock price fall slightly higher than the probability of a rise is the most reasonable estimate.  The overall robust state of Apple's business mitigates the potential for significant stock price movement.  The larger uncertainty and the bearish trend in the previous predictions weigh more heavily in my prediction than the limited immediate impact of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile store introduces a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, particularly in the European Union.
