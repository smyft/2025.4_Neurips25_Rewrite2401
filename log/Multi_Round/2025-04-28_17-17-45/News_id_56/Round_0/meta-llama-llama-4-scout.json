Meta Platforms' positive sales report and its implications for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI and augmented reality investments do not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations or stock performance. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that this news will have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that the news is positively related to the tech industry's AI and AR segments, which Apple is also involved in, there could be a slight indirect positive impact. But overall, the impact is expected to be minimal. Hence, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising due to the general positive sentiment in the tech industry, but still keeping it relatively neutral.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45,\n}\n```"
