(AAPL), we must consider the indirect effects. The article mentions Meta's success and its focus on AI and augmented reality. This could potentially indicate a competitive landscape where tech companies are investing heavily in future technologies. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, might be seen as a company that could also benefit from advancements in AI and augmented reality, or it might face increased competition. Without direct information about Apple's performance or plans, the impact on AAPL's stock is speculative. However, given that the news does not directly relate to Apple and considering the general trend of tech companies benefiting from advancements in AI and AR, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated based on the potential for increased competition and the broad positive trend in tech due to innovative investments.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
