While this news primarily pertains to Meta, strong performance by competitors can positively impact investor sentiment towards technology stocks, including Apple. However, the emphasis on Meta's investments in AI and augmented reality could also ignite competitive concerns for Apple if investors perceive that Meta is taking significant strides in areas where Apple is also investing. Overall, the implications for Apple are mixed but lean towards a positive sentiment given that tech stocks often move in correlation with each other. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but there is a reasonable chance it could fall due to competitive pressures.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
