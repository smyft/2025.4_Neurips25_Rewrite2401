      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\nNews Content: Revenue grows to $48.4 billion, helping fuel the chief executive\u2019s bets on augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Meta Platforms' strong revenue growth, which signifies a robust performance in the tech sector. While this news primarily pertains to Meta, strong performance by competitors can positively impact investor sentiment towards technology stocks, including Apple. However, the emphasis on Meta's investments in AI and augmented reality could also ignite competitive concerns for Apple if investors perceive that Meta is taking significant strides in areas where Apple is also investing. Overall, the implications for Apple are mixed but lean towards a positive sentiment given that tech stocks often move in correlation with each other. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but there is a reasonable chance it could fall due to competitive pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms (META) and its revenue growth fueling AI and AR investments. While this is positive news for Meta, there's no direct implication for Apple. Indirectly, strong performance in the tech sector (as shown by Meta's results) can create a generally positive sentiment towards other tech giants like Apple and can boost confidence for investors. However, because the direct impact on Apple is low, a neutral to slightly positive price movement is more probable. The positive knock-on effect for consumer demand in tech is also important.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Meta Platforms' strong financial performance and increased investment in AI and AR. While this is positive news for Meta, its direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile operating systems, advertising), but the news doesn't directly address Apple's performance or prospects.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news is low.  Any movement would likely be driven by other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this Meta announcement.  A slight upward movement is slightly more likely due to the general positive sentiment in tech associated with AI success, but the correlation is weak.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Meta Platforms' (not Apple Inc.) strong sales performance and its investment in AI and augmented reality. Since the news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is unlikely to have a significant impact on AAPL's stock price. However, there might be a slight negative sentiment if investors perceive Meta's success as a competitive threat to Apple in the AI and AR space. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities are skewed towards no significant movement, but with a slight bias towards a potential minor negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news provided is about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. However, since the task is to analyze the impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL), we must consider the indirect effects. The article mentions Meta's success and its focus on AI and augmented reality. This could potentially indicate a competitive landscape where tech companies are investing heavily in future technologies. Apple, being a major player in the tech industry, might be seen as a company that could also benefit from advancements in AI and augmented reality, or it might face increased competition. Without direct information about Apple's performance or plans, the impact on AAPL's stock is speculative. However, given that the news does not directly relate to Apple and considering the general trend of tech companies benefiting from advancements in AI and AR, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated based on the potential for increased competition and the broad positive trend in tech due to innovative investments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights strong revenue growth at Meta Platforms, which is attributed to increased investments in augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Since these technologies are also significant focus areas for Apple Inc., positive developments at Meta could signal potential benefits for Apple's own initiatives in these domains. However, the news directly pertains to Meta, not Apple, potentially causing some investor attention to shift towards Meta, hence there might be a slight dilution effect on Apple's stock price. The overall market sentiment towards tech stocks may improve due to the success of Meta's ventures.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Since the news directly pertains to Meta and not Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect. Generally, strong performance by one tech giant can boost investor sentiment towards other tech companies, including Apple, due to the sector's often correlated movement. However, there's also a potential competitive concern if investors perceive Meta's advancements in AI and AR as a threat to Apple's market position. Considering these factors, there seems to be a slightly positive sentiment leaning due to the overall positive tech sector trend, but with a cautious approach due to potential competitive pressures.
