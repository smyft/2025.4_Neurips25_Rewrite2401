While Apple is mentioned in the context of discussions about testing ads on the same platform, there is no direct news about Apple's financial performance, product announcements, or significant changes in business strategy. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal or indirect. Given that the news does not provide any negative information about Apple, the probability of the stock price falling is low. However, without any directly positive news, the probability of a significant stock price rise is also low. The neutral nature of the news suggests a higher likelihood of stability than a drastic change in stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```"
