While this is potentially positive news for X and could indirectly benefit companies advertising there, the connection to Apple's stock price is weak and indirect. The impact is likely to be minimal.  Apple's stock price is driven by much larger factors such as product sales, overall economic conditions, and investor sentiment.  The news about Amazon's ad spending on X is not a significant event likely to substantially influence Apple's stock price in either direction.
