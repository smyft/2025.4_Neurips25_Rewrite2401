This indirectly affects Apple because the article mentions Apple is considering testing ads on X. Increased advertising activity on X can be interpreted in two ways for Apple: 1) Positive - Amazon's increased spending may validate X as a potentially effective ad platform, making Apple more likely to invest which could boost revenue and brand awareness. 2) Negative - Increased presence on X, a controversial platform, presents potential risks of association with negative content and brand reputation damage. Additional, there are other earnings reports with companies such as KLA and Atlassian posting strong earnings. A positive earnings report would be more bullish for the market as a whole, and therefore has an increased chance of outweighing the potential reputation implications for Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
