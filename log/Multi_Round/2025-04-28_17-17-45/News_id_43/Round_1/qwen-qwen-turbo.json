      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is increasing its spending on social media platform X, marking a major U-turn from the e-commerce after scaling back on advertising on the Elon's Musk-owned platform more than a year ago amid concerns about growing hate speech on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe news comes as other companies have also been mulling whether to return to X at a time when Musk has President Donald Trump's ear after playing a key role on election campaign trail.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in recent weeks weeks has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform, a person familiar with the situation told the Journal.\n\nAmazon was down 1% in recent trading.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\n\nKLA Corp earnings beat by $0.45, revenue topped estimates\n\nAtlassian stock soars 18% on earnings beat, strong outlook\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on social media, which could signal a shift in advertising strategies among major companies. While this news is primarily about Amazon, it also includes that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform X. This could imply a more competitive advertising landscape, potentially benefiting Apple if they execute well. However, the news does not provide a direct catalyst for Apple stock movement. Given the mixed implications and general market conditions, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing ad spending on X. This indirectly affects Apple because the article mentions Apple is considering testing ads on X. Increased advertising activity on X can be interpreted in two ways for Apple: 1) Positive - Amazon's increased spending may validate X as a potentially effective ad platform, making Apple more likely to invest which could boost revenue and brand awareness. 2) Negative - Increased presence on X, a controversial platform, presents potential risks of association with negative content and brand reputation damage. Additional, there are other earnings reports with companies such as KLA and Atlassian posting strong earnings. A positive earnings report would be more bullish for the market as a whole, and therefore has an increased chance of outweighing the potential reputation implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform.  While this is potentially positive news for X and could indirectly benefit companies advertising there, the connection to Apple's stock price is weak and indirect. The impact is likely to be minimal.  Apple's stock price is driven by much larger factors such as product sales, overall economic conditions, and investor sentiment.  The news about Amazon's ad spending on X is not a significant event likely to substantially influence Apple's stock price in either direction. Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad-spending on X and mentions Apple's discussions about testing ads on the platform. While Amazon's stock was down 1%, the impact on Apple's stock is less direct. Apple's potential engagement with X for ads could be seen as a minor positive, but the overall news is more about Amazon and X. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X. While Apple is mentioned in the context of discussions about testing ads on the same platform, there is no direct news about Apple's financial performance, product announcements, or significant changes in business strategy. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal or indirect. Given that the news does not provide any negative information about Apple, the probability of the stock price falling is low. However, without any directly positive news, the probability of a significant stock price rise is also low. The neutral nature of the news suggests a higher likelihood of stability than a drastic change in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article reports that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on social media platform X, which may indicate a growing trend of companies returning to the platform. Additionally, it is mentioned that Apple has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform. This could be seen as a positive sign for Apple, as it may lead to increased revenue from advertising. However, the news does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is moderate, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, a social media platform. This news does not directly affect Apple Inc. but there might be implications such as increased competition or market trends affecting both companies. The report states that Amazon was down 1% recently which might imply some uncertainty among investors. While it's uncertain how Apple will be affected directly, considering broader industry trends, there is less immediate cause for a significant change in Apple\u2019s stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
