      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is increasing its spending on social media platform X, marking a major U-turn from the e-commerce after scaling back on advertising on the Elon's Musk-owned platform more than a year ago amid concerns about growing hate speech on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe news comes as other companies have also been mulling whether to return to X at a time when Musk has President Donald Trump's ear after playing a key role on election campaign trail.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in recent weeks weeks has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform, a person familiar with the situation told the Journal.\n\nAmazon was down 1% in recent trading.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\n\nKLA Corp earnings beat by $0.45, revenue topped estimates\n\nAtlassian stock soars 18% on earnings beat, strong outlook\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on social media, which could signal a shift in advertising strategies among major companies. While this news is primarily about Amazon, it also includes that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform X. This could imply a more competitive advertising landscape, potentially benefiting Apple if they execute well. However, the news does not provide a direct catalyst for Apple stock movement. Given the mixed implications and general market conditions, the probabilities of significant movement in either direction are moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Amazon is increasing ad spending on X. This indirectly affects Apple because the article mentions Apple is considering testing ads on X. Increased advertising activity on X can be interpreted in two ways for Apple: 1) Positive - Amazon's increased spending may validate X as a potentially effective ad platform, making Apple more likely to invest which could boost revenue and brand awareness. 2) Negative - Increased presence on X, a controversial platform, presents potential risks of association with negative content and brand reputation damage. Additional, there are other earnings reports with companies such as KLA and Atlassian posting strong earnings. A positive earnings report would be more bullish for the market as a whole, and therefore has an increased chance of outweighing the potential reputation implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X (formerly Twitter), and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the platform.  While this is potentially positive news for X and could indirectly benefit companies advertising there, the connection to Apple's stock price is weak and indirect. The impact is likely to be minimal.  Apple's stock price is driven by much larger factors such as product sales, overall economic conditions, and investor sentiment.  The news about Amazon's ad spending on X is not a significant event likely to substantially influence Apple's stock price in either direction. Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad-spending on X and mentions Apple's discussions about testing ads on the platform. While Amazon's stock was down 1%, the impact on Apple's stock is less direct. Apple's potential engagement with X for ads could be seen as a minor positive, but the overall news is more about Amazon and X. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X. While Apple is mentioned in the context of discussions about testing ads on the same platform, there is no direct news about Apple's financial performance, product announcements, or significant changes in business strategy. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal or indirect. Given that the news does not provide any negative information about Apple, the probability of the stock price falling is low. However, without any directly positive news, the probability of a significant stock price rise is also low. The neutral nature of the news suggests a higher likelihood of stability than a drastic change in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article reports that Amazon is increasing its ad spending on social media platform X, which may indicate a growing trend of companies returning to the platform. Additionally, it is mentioned that Apple has had discussions about testing out ads on the platform. This could be seen as a positive sign for Apple, as it may lead to increased revenue from advertising. However, the news does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is moderate, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, a social media platform. This news does not directly affect Apple Inc. but there might be implications such as increased competition or market trends affecting both companies. The report states that Amazon was down 1% recently which might imply some uncertainty among investors. While it's uncertain how Apple will be affected directly, considering broader industry trends, there is less immediate cause for a significant change in Apple\u2019s stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Amazon's increased ad spending on the social media platform X, while also mentioning Apple's consideration of testing ads there. While the implications for Apple are mostly indirect, the positive shift in advertising strategies could signal a growing acceptance of X as a platform and potentially bode well for Apple if they proceed with advertising. However, the lack of direct news about Apple\u2019s financial performance or product developments limits the strength of these implications. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a slightly positive sentiment towards Apple's stock price due to potential advertising revenue, tempered by the overall indirect nature of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with a secondary mention that Apple is considering testing ads on the same platform. This is a weaker, more indirect link to Apple's stock performance. While Amazon's movement was downwards, the effect on Apple is more ambiguous. The previous rounds of predictions show a mix of slightly positive to neutral outlooks, with some acknowledging the potential risks associated with advertising on a platform like X. Given the mixed signals and the relatively weak direct impact on Apple, I am hedging towards a neutral stance, but slightly adjusted the probabilities based on previous rounds of predictions. Furthermore, the Llama-3.3 model predicted a low falling probabilitity of 0.2. I am going to move slightly towards this suggestion.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with a tangential mention of Apple exploring ads on the same platform.  This is weak indirect news for Apple. The connection is tenuous; Apple's stock price is driven by far more significant factors like product sales and overall market sentiment. While increased ad spending on X could *potentially* benefit Apple if they choose to advertise there, it's not a substantial driver of their stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most acknowledging the limited impact. The fact that Amazon's stock is down despite the increased spending suggests some market uncertainty, which could also influence Apple's stock, albeit slightly and indirectly.  Considering the weak correlation and the various other strong factors impacting Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is low.  The most likely outcome is minimal change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with a minor mention of Apple considering testing ads on the same platform. While this could indicate a broader trend of companies returning to X, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is minimal. The news does not provide any significant positive or negative catalysts specific to Apple. Given the indirect nature of the news and the lack of direct financial implications for Apple, the probabilities of a significant stock price movement in either direction are low. Previous predictions also reflect a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with most models assigning moderate probabilities to a rise and lower probabilities to a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X, which has a mixed implication for Apple's stock price. While Amazon's increased ad spending on X could signal a trend for advertising on the platform, Apple's potential discussions about testing ads on X are mentioned but do not provide a direct or strong catalyst for stock movement. The impact on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive, as it indicates potential opportunities for advertising revenue growth but does not provide concrete financial benefits or changes in business strategy. Given that there is no directly negative information about Apple and the potential for increased ad revenue, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately higher than a fall. However, the overall impact is likely limited due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Amazon increasing its ad spending on social media platform X and Apple considering testing ads on the same platform suggests a potentially neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. The indirect nature of the news means that the effect on Apple's stock is not strongly correlated with the news. However, considering the trend of other companies' earnings reports being positive, such as KLA and Atlassian, and the mixed implications of increased advertising activity on X for Apple, the probabilities of a significant movement in either direction are moderate. Given that most models predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, and considering the general positive trend in the market with other companies posting strong earnings, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X and the consideration of Apple testing ads on the same platform. While Amazon's decision to increase spending may indicate market trends affecting both companies, the direct implications for Apple remain limited. The news doesn't provide specific details on Apple's financial health, recent performance, or product launches that could trigger a significant stock price movement. However, Apple's potential engagement with X for ads could be viewed positively, implying slight benefits to advertising revenues. Given the neutral nature of the news for Apple specifically and considering broader industry trends, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's increase in ad spending on social media platform X and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads there. While this reflects a potential positive trend in advertising, the direct impact on Apple's stock is limited and mostly indirect. Many previous predictions indicate a sentiment leaning towards slight positivity, with some models suggesting neutral outcomes due to the lack of direct news related to Apple's financial health. The overall market sentiment is mixed, but recent positive earnings reports from other companies may contribute small upward pressure. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability for the stock price rising versus falling, although both probabilities remain relatively close.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Amazon's ad spending on X and mentions Apple considering testing ads on the same platform. The impact on Apple is indirect. Previous predictions show a mix of slightly positive to neutral outlooks. There is no significantly new information in this round. Therefore the prediction should be close to previous rounds. However, since the previous predictions do show an overall slightly positive trend, I will be slightly more confident about that trend in this prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news is primarily focused on Amazon's increased ad spending on X, with only a tangential mention of Apple exploring the platform for advertising.  This connection is weak and indirect. While a positive development for X, it doesn't offer a strong catalyst for Apple's stock price, which is driven by far more significant factors like its product sales, innovation, and overall market sentiment.  The previous predictions vary, with many models acknowledging the limited impact of this news on Apple. The fact that Amazon's stock is down despite increased ad spend suggests some market uncertainty, further mitigating any potential positive impact on Apple.  Considering the weak correlation and other major factors impacting Apple's price (and the significant variance in previous predictions showing no strong consensus), the likelihood of significant movement in either direction is low.  The probabilities are weighted towards the neutral end, reflecting the overall lack of direct and impactful news regarding Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X, with a minor mention of Apple considering testing ads on the same platform. This is an indirect and relatively weak connection to Apple's stock performance, as the news does not provide any direct financial or strategic impact on Apple. The implications for Apple are neutral to slightly positive, given the potential for increased ad revenue if they proceed with advertising on X. However, the lack of direct catalysts and the broader market context suggest minimal immediate impact. Previous predictions also reflect a neutral to slightly positive outlook, with most models assigning moderate probabilities to a rise and lower probabilities to a fall. Considering these factors, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is low, with a slight edge towards a rise given the potential positive implications of advertising on X.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on social media platform X and mentions that Apple is considering testing ads on the same platform. While the news does not provide direct information about Apple's financial performance or product announcements, it suggests a potential opportunity for Apple to increase its advertising revenue. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minimal. However, given the positive trend in the market with other companies posting strong earnings, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news about Amazon increasing its ad spending on social media platform X and Apple considering testing ads on the same platform has a mixed implication for Apple's stock price. The indirect nature of the news means that the effect on Apple's stock is not strongly correlated with the news. However, considering the trend of other companies' earnings reports being positive and the mixed implications of increased advertising activity on X for Apple, the probabilities of a significant movement in either direction are moderate. Given that most models predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, and considering the general positive trend in the market with other companies posting strong earnings, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.36, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Amazon's increased ad spending on X and the consideration of Apple testing ads on the same platform. While Amazon's decision to increase spending may indicate market trends affecting both companies, the direct implications for Apple remain limited. The news doesn't provide specific details on Apple's financial health, recent performance, or product launches that could trigger a significant stock price movement. However, Apple's potential engagement with X for ads could be viewed positively, implying slight benefits to advertising revenues. Given the neutral nature of the news for Apple specifically and considering broader industry trends, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Previous predictions by several models suggest a moderate likelihood of a slight positive movement, but many also emphasize the indirect nature of the news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
