(AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cBuy\u201d and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company\u2019s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence\u2019s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's slower revenue growth and a downgrade in price target by Goldman Sachs, driven by concerns over iPhone sales amidst increasing competition in China. However, it also points to future optimism regarding new product launches and the potential impact of Apple Intelligence. The mixed messaging suggests a cautious outlook while underlying strengths may support the stock. Therefore, the probability of a rise and fall in stock price is relatively balanced yet tilted slightly more towards a decrease due to immediate concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is investing in AI (Apple Intelligence) and is a major player with a strong ecosystem, the article highlights concerns about slower revenue growth, particularly due to iPhone sales and competition in China. A Goldman Sachs downgrade (though still a \"Buy\" rating) further reinforces this concern. While they are optimistic about future growth driven by AI features and product releases in 2025/2026, the immediate impact is less certain. The article also pitches other AI stocks as potentially having higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting AAPL might be a slower grower. The near-term pressure from potentially weaker iPhone sales and competitive pressures, coupled with the suggestion of better performing AI stocks elsewhere, will offset the long-term AI investment upside.\nGiven the mixed signals, there isn't a clear positive catalyst. The downward revision from Goldman Sachs is negative, but still a positive outlook. The AI hype has already been largely priced into the stock and thus the short-term outlook appears bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Goldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating, it lowers its price target due to anticipated slower iPhone sales.  The article emphasizes the potential of Apple Intelligence and the broader AI market, suggesting future growth. However, the article also compares Apple's AI prospects to other companies, implying that some AI stocks might offer superior returns. The revenue forecast is slightly below consensus, further contributing to uncertainty.  The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, highlighting both positive and negative factors.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a slight increase, reflective of the continued positive outlook despite the near-term revenue concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights both positive and negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple's expansion into AI with 'Apple Intelligence' and the anticipation of new product launches (Mac, iPad, iPhone SE, and iPhone 17/18) could drive investor optimism. Additionally, Goldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating despite lowering the price target, indicating confidence in long-term growth. On the negative side, slower revenue growth, lower iPhone sales, and increasing competition in the Chinese market pose risks. The balance of these factors suggests a moderately positive outlook, but with some uncertainty due to near-term challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position in the AI market, mentioning its recent launch of Apple Intelligence and its ecosystem strength. While the article notes a price target downgrade by Goldman Sachs from $286 to $280 per share due to lower iPhone sales, the firm remains optimistic about Apple's future growth, particularly driven by the rollout of Apple Intelligence and new product launches. The overall sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive, as the article highlights Apple's potential in AI while also mentioning challenges. However, the Goldman Sachs analysis suggests that concerns about competition and limited impact on iPhone demand may be overstated, potentially leading to improved market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) position in the AI industry, its recent launch of Apple Intelligence, and the potential for future growth. Although the company faces increasing competition in the Chinese market, Goldman Sachs has reiterated a 'Buy' rating and expects accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. The article also highlights the potential of AI agents and their increasing adoption, which could positively impact AAPL's stock price. However, the price target downgrade due to lower iPhone sales may negatively affect the stock price in the short term. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
