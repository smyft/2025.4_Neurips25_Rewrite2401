This positive performance, along with their significant influence on major market indexes, suggests a favorable outlook. While the article also mentions Tesla sliding, which could create some market hesitancy, the overall tone regarding Apple is positive. Given this, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. However, since the headline itself is backward-looking (reporting on past gains) rather than forward-looking (announcing new innovations or positive catalysts), the impact is likely to be moderate, not dramatic. Also, it is important to keep the context of overall market sentiments and other market factors which are not presented. This is just a prediction based on only one news article.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Magnificent Seven Stocks: Nvidia, Apple Surge; Tesla Slides To Key Level\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
