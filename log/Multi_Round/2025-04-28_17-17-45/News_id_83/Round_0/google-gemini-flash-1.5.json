This is positive news and suggests recent upward momentum. However, the headline is relatively vague and doesn't provide specific details about the reasons for the surge or the magnitude of the price movement. The lack of specific information prevents a precise probability assessment.  The probability of a rise is therefore assigned a higher value based on the positive sentiment, but it's not a certain outcome.  The probability of a fall is assigned a low value, reflecting the positive tone of the news but acknowledging that market fluctuations are always possible.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Magnificent Seven Stocks: Nvidia, Apple Surge; Tesla Slides To Key Level\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```\n"
