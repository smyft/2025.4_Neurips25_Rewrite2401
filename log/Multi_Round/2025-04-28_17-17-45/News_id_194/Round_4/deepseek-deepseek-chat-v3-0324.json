(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet\nNews Content: Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and strategic challenges, which primarily affect Intel's stock value rather than Apple's. The lack of a clear strategy and uncertainty regarding Intel's future could have a negative impact on technology sector sentiment, potentially affecting Apple indirectly due to its position in the semiconductor supply chain. Analysts speaking negatively about Intel's board and leadership could create broader market concerns about the tech segment. Therefore, while it's common for Apple and Intel to be correlated due to their industry relationship, the immediate impact on AAPL's stock from this news seems limited, suggesting a slight tendency for stability rather than sharp movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news regarding Intel's CEO search creates uncertainty and reflects underlying strategic problems. The absence of clear frontrunners, the criticisms of potential internal candidates, and the possibility of external candidates being hesitant to take the role all contribute to negative sentiment. The board's perceived lack of direction and strategic missteps further exacerbate these concerns. While there is talk of a potential acquisition, it's just a rumor and doesn't change the underlying problems. The focus on Intel's internal issues outweighs any potential positive impact on even though the mentioned company is Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's (INTC) CEO search, highlighting uncertainty and a lack of clear direction.  While several potential candidates are mentioned, including some with strong reputations and others with internal criticisms, the overall tone suggests a prolonged period of instability.  The article mentions acquisition rumors, which could potentially lead to a stock price surge, but this remains highly speculative. The lack of a clear CEO and the ongoing strategic uncertainty outweigh any potential positive impacts of acquisition talk.  The fact that the article focuses on INTC, not AAPL, means this news is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price. There's no direct causal relationship between Intel's leadership turmoil and AAPL's stock performance. Therefore, the probabilities of AAPL rising or falling due to *this specific news* are very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which have led to a significant stock decline. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The focus of the article is on Intel, not Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Intel's (INTC) search for a new CEO and the potential candidates, which has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, one of the mentioned candidates is Johny Srouji, Apple's internal chip head. This information might have a minor impact on Apple's stock price, but it is unlikely to be significant. The overall uncertainty and lack of a clear frontrunner for Intel's CEO position do not directly affect Apple's business operations or outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Intel's search for a new CEO and the potential candidates for the role. However, the article also mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position. If Srouji were to leave Apple, it could potentially have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. On the other hand, the article does not provide any direct information that would suggest a significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on the provided news headline, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling is mostly neutral, with a slight inclination towards a fall due to potential concerns about Srouji's potential departure.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses significant challenges at Intel related to CEO selection and the company's overall strategic direction. This uncertainty could affect investor confidence and potentially lead to stock price volatility. For Apple Inc., there is no direct relationship between Intel's CEO selection process and Apple's immediate financial performance or strategic direction. However, investors might shift focus or sentiment which could indirectly affect AAPL's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's CEO search, which has significant implications for Intel's strategic direction, but does not have a direct bearing on Apple's operations or stock performance. The mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for the Intel CEO position adds a layer of complexity; if he were to leave Apple, it might create uncertainties for Apple investors. However, the overall sentiment around Intel's turmoil and the lack of coherent strategy could create a cautious atmosphere within the tech sector. This might indirectly affect Apple's stock price through broader market sentiment. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds \u2013 with several leaning towards stability or minimal movement \u2013 a balanced view leads to probabilities that reflect minimal changes in AAPL's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's struggles, specifically their difficulty in finding a new CEO. While there's mention of Apple's chip head being a potential candidate, the overall negative sentiment surrounding Intel's leadership vacuum and strategic uncertainty is more likely to weigh on the tech sector as a whole, albeit indirectly impacting Apple. The previous rounds also indicate mixed sentiment, with some models seeing minimal impact and others a slight negative inclination for AAPL. Given the absence of strong positive indicators and the continuing uncertainty in the news despite potential candidates being named, a slight decrease is more probable in investor sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Intel's CEO search and internal struggles. While Apple's Johny Srouji is mentioned as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position,  the likelihood of him leaving Apple is uncertain, and even if he did, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively modest. The overall news is not directly relevant to Apple's performance or outlook.  Considering previous model predictions showing a wide range of probabilities, mostly clustered around a neutral stance (or low impact), and the indirect nature of the relationship, it's reasonable to assume minimal impact on Apple's stock price. The overall market sentiment and other factors unrelated to this news would likely have a much stronger influence on AAPL's price movements.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Intel's challenges in selecting a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are specific to Intel (INTC) and do not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this is a minor and indirect connection that is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price. The news does not provide any substantive information about Apple's business operations, financial performance, or strategic direction. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price from this news is expected to be minimal, with no strong tendency for either a rise or a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which have led to a significant stock decline. While the article mentions Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. The focus of the article is on Intel, not Apple. However, the mention of Srouji as a potential candidate could introduce minor uncertainty for Apple's stock due to the potential loss of a key executive. Overall, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Intel's challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps. Although Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji is mentioned as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this does not directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. The overall uncertainty and lack of a clear frontrunner for Intel's CEO position do not directly affect Apple's business operations or outlook. However, considering the industry relationship between Intel and Apple, and the potential indirect impact of Intel's struggles on the tech sector, there might be a slight inclination towards a neutral or slight negative sentiment. Given the information and the previous predictions, the estimated probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards no significant change.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Intel's efforts to find a new CEO and strategic missteps, which has little direct correlation to Apple Inc.'s stock movements. Although the news mentions Johny Srouji, Apple's internal chip head, as a possible candidate, this does not provide any concrete indication that he will leave Apple. Without additional information to suggest a high probability of Srouji's departure or a significant operational impact on Apple, the news is unlikely to heavily influence Apple's stock price movement. The probabilities seem to tilt marginally towards stability with a slight negative skew due to broader market sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news centers on Intel's difficulties in selecting a new CEO and its strategic challenges, which primarily affect Intel's position rather than Apple's. Although there is a mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this adds a layer of uncertainty for Apple investors but does not create direct implications for Apple's operations or stock performance. The overall sentiment from previous predictions leans towards stability with a cautious sentiment in the tech sector, reflecting uncertainty around Intel rather than a direct correlation to Apple's stock. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling remain quite balanced, with a slight tilt towards a potential decrease due to the uncertainty surrounding Srouji's position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's internal struggles in finding a CEO, highlighting strategic missteps. While Apple's chip head is mentioned as a potential candidate, this is a weak and indirect link. Previous models generally lean towards neutral to slight negative impact. Considering the limited direct relevance to Apple's operations and financial performance, the impact should be minimal. The concern surrounding Intel's future has no impact on Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Intel's CEO search, a matter largely unrelated to Apple's immediate prospects.  While Apple's Johny Srouji is mentioned as a potential Intel CEO candidate, his departure is purely speculative.  Even if he were to leave, the impact on Apple would likely be indirect and relatively minor in the short term. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but mostly leaning towards a small probability of either a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price. The overall consensus reflects minimal impact from this news.  Broader market sentiment and other factors unrelated to Intel's CEO search will likely be far more influential on AAPL's daily stock price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's (INTC) challenges in finding a new CEO and its strategic missteps, which are specific to Intel and do not directly impact Apple Inc.

Although Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji is mentioned as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this adds a layer of uncertainty but does not indicate a direct impact on Apple's operations or stock performance. There is a cautious sentiment in the tech sector due to Intel's turmoil, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock, but the overall sentiment and mixed predictions from previous analyses suggest minimal movement. Therefore, a slight inclination towards a potential decrease in stock price reflects the cautious sentiment surrounding the broader tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Intel's CEO search and struggles, with a minor mention of Apple's chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate. This indirect link and speculative nature of Srouji's potential departure result in minimal expected impact on Apple's stock. Most previous predictions lean towards neutrality or a slight negative bias. Given the limited direct relevance to Apple's operations or financial performance, and the potential but unlikely departure of Srouji, a largely neutral stance is maintained. Broader market and industry trends will likely be more influential.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Intel's CEO search and internal turmoil.  While Apple's Johny Srouji is mentioned as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO position, this is a weak link and the probability of him leaving Apple is unknown. Even if he were to depart, the impact on Apple's stock price in the short term is likely to be minimal and indirect.  The overall news is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate financial performance or strategic direction. Previous model predictions consistently show a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, reflecting the lack of direct impact on Apple.  Considering the absence of strong positive indicators and the prevailing uncertainty regarding Intel, a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price is most probable.
