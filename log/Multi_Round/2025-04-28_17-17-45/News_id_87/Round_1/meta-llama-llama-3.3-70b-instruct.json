(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts\nNews Content: A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competitive pressure on major tech companies, including Apple, following the announcement of a cheaper AI model from DeepSeek. This raises concerns about future earnings growth among tech giants, which have been crucial for market performance. The heavy sell-off in the Nasdaq and broader indices reflects how investors are reacting to fears over diminished earnings potential for companies like Apple. While Apple has a strong position in the market, the competitive threat and changing sentiment could lead to increased volatility. Overall, the analysis suggests a higher probability of price decline in light of recent market reactions to similar news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on a potential threat to the dominance of large tech companies, including Apple, due to a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek. While the article acknowledges Apple's inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' and its contribution to the past earnings growth driving the market, it suggests a potential shift away from this narrow leadership, where broader market participation is expected. However, the immediate impact on Apple is unclear. Further, It suggests that big tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years, and if Big Tech's dominance wanes, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500, but it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge. Monday showed some stocks closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Overall, the news suggests a slightly negative short-term sentiment for Apple, but the extent is hard to extrapolate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential threat posed by DeepSeek's cheaper AI model to Nvidia and other tech giants' earnings growth.  While Apple is mentioned as a 'Magnificent Seven' company whose earnings estimates have been driving the market, the article highlights concerns about the sustainability of this growth and a potential shift towards broader market participation. Although Apple is not directly impacted by DeepSeek's technology in the same way as Nvidia, the broader market sentiment shift and the potential slowing of Big Tech's dominance could negatively impact Apple's stock price. The article suggests a decreased likelihood of the large gains seen recently for the tech sector, indicating a lower probability of a significant price increase for AAPL. However, it does not suggest a complete collapse of the stock.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly more towards a price fall, but acknowledge the possibility of some price stability or even minor increases due to factors outside of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about Big Tech's earnings estimates due to competitive pressures from DeepSeek's cheaper AI model, which could challenge the dominance of US tech giants like Apple. The market reacted negatively, with significant drops in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Apple, being part of the 'Magnificent Seven,' is likely to face scrutiny over its earnings growth potential. The article suggests a potential shift in market leadership, which could negatively impact Apple's stock in the short term. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong brand may mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of a cheaper, competitive AI model from DeepSeek on the stock market, particularly on tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the Big Tech companies, the news does not directly indicate a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the overall sentiment suggests a potential downturn for tech stocks due to increased competition and scrutiny over tech earnings. Given that Apple's stock performance is often influenced by the broader tech sector trends, there is a cautious outlook. The probabilities are estimated based on the potential for market volatility and competition affecting tech stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of DeepSeek's cheaper and competitive AI model on the stock market, particularly on US tech giants like Nvidia and Broadcom. The article suggests that this could lead to a decline in earnings estimates for these companies, which have been driving the bull market. As Apple is one of the Big Tech companies mentioned, its stock price may be affected by the potential decline in earnings estimates. However, the article also notes that the market may be due for a change, with speculation meeting reduced liquidity and fundamental investing outperforming. This could lead to a broadening of the stock market rally, potentially benefiting Apple. Given the mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.6.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns about Chinese AI company DeepSeek presenting competitive challenges to US tech giants, particularly Nvidia and Broadcom. Investors perceive this as a threat to the growth prospects of these companies, leading to a sell-off in major indices including the Nasdaq and S&P 500. While Apple (AAPL) isn't directly mentioned as a target of concern, its dependence on technology trends and potential market shifts towards non-Big Tech sectors could impact its performance. The broader market's skepticism about Big Tech's sustained dominance may lead to cautious sentiment towards AAPL's stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
