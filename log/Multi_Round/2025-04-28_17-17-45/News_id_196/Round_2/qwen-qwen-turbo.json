(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $1B Deal Poised to End Indonesia iPhone 16 Ban, Officials Say\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged higher Thursday after reports indicated the company is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani told Bloomberg in Davos that he expects a resolution within one to two weeks.\n\nThe government had previously rejected Apple's $1 billion investment plan, which included an AirTag factory, saying it did not meet local content requirements for smartphone production. Indonesia first imposed the ban in October 2024, citing Apple's failure to meet investment thresholds. The company initially offered $100 million over two years, later increasing the bid to $1 billion.\n\nReports last month suggested President Prabowo Subianto approved the latest proposal, paving the way for a deal. Roeslani said the government and Apple are now working through differences in how local content is calculated and expressed confidence that an agreement will soon allow iPhone 16 sales to resume in the Southeast Asian market.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant issue that has prevented the sale of iPhone 16 in Indonesia, a major market. The proposed $1 billion investment plan shows Apple's commitment to meeting local regulations, and the expectation of a resolution within one to two weeks is a positive indication for both the company and its investors. Historically, successful negotiations and the potential resumption of product sales typically lead to positive reactions in stock prices. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple, as it suggests the resolution of a dispute that was blocking iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia. Indonesia is a potentially large market. The resolution of this issue removes a barrier to sales and represents a positive growth signal for Apple. The increase in investment commitment from $100 million to $1 billion indicates Apple is taking the Indonesian market seriously and will likely increase revenue, so I estimate the probability of a rise in stock price to be higher than the probability of a fall. This positive indicator is slightly tempered by the fact that the headline includes the word \"poised\" which indicated that the deal isn't 100% done and that the report cites government officials rather than the company itself.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential resolution to a significant issue impacting Apple's sales in Indonesia. The Indonesian government's ban on iPhone 16 sales due to unmet investment rules was a considerable risk, potentially affecting revenue and market share.  A $1 billion investment deal nearing completion suggests this risk is significantly mitigated. While the exact impact is uncertain (Indonesia may represent a smaller portion of Apple's global sales), the removal of the sales ban is largely positive.  The market's initial positive reaction (Apple edging higher Thursday) supports this assessment. However, the overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors can still influence the stock price.  Therefore, a high probability of price rise is predicted, but a small probability of fall isn't ruled out due to potential market volatility or other unforeseen circumstances.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia over the ban on iPhone 16 sales, which was initially imposed due to local investment rules. The resolution is expected within one to two weeks, and the government has shown confidence in reaching an agreement. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it removes a barrier to sales in a significant Southeast Asian market. The initial rejection of Apple's $1 billion investment plan and the subsequent progress towards a resolution suggest that the market will react favorably to the news, anticipating increased sales and market access.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over the iPhone 16 ban, which was imposed due to Apple's failure to meet local investment thresholds. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes setting up an AirTag factory, and Indonesian officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it removes a significant market barrier and adds to Apple's investment and revenue opportunities. Given this positive outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. The investment minister expects a resolution within one to two weeks, and the company's $1 billion investment plan is likely to be approved. This resolution would allow iPhone 16 sales to resume in the Southeast Asian market, potentially boosting Apple's sales and revenue. As a result, the stock price is likely to rise due to this positive news. The fact that the company's initial offer was increased from $100 million to $1 billion and the government is now working through differences in how local content is calculated suggests that a deal is imminent. This suggests a high probability of the stock price rising and a low probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential resolution to a dispute between Apple and the Indonesian government, which could lead to the lifting of a ban on iPhone 16 sales. Such developments typically have positive implications for a company's stock price as they remove uncertainties and open new markets. Given the scale of the investment ($1 billion), it suggests a strong commitment from Apple and could imply potential long-term growth opportunities.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is nearing a resolution to its dispute with the Indonesian government regarding the sales ban on the iPhone 16. The proposed $1 billion investment suggests a significant commitment from Apple to meet local requirements, which is likely to remove barriers to sales in a key market. Given the expected timeline for resolution and the positive sentiment expressed by government officials, the market is likely to react favorably. The previous probabilities suggest a strong consensus around a positive outlook, which reinforces the expectation of a stock price rise. However, there remains a minor risk of market volatility that could temper these projections. Overall, the news strongly supports a higher probability of stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is undeniably positive for Apple, resolving a potential barrier to entry in the Indonesian market. The $1 billion investment signals a strong commitment to Indonesia, which should reassure investors. All previous models also recognized this as a positive catalyst for a price increase. I will weight my numbers slightly towards a more conservative estimate due to the fact that no further news or price movement has been mentioned between the publishing of this article a couple months beforehand, assuming that the positive aspects of this deal might have been price in earlier.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple.  Resolving the Indonesian iPhone 16 sales ban, a significant obstacle, is a major win. The substantial $1 billion investment demonstrates Apple's commitment to the Indonesian market. While the deal isn't finalized, the strong likelihood of a swift resolution within 1-2 weeks, along with positive government statements, points towards a highly probable positive market reaction.  The previous round predictions all show a strong consensus towards a price increase, reinforcing this assessment.  The slight uncertainty inherent in the 'poised to end' phrasing is acknowledged, but it's outweighed by the substantial positive implications of this development. The market's immediate upward reaction upon initial report supports this positive outlook. However, overall market volatility and unforeseen external factors are still potential variables, hence a small probability of price fall is included.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple Inc. as it is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The $1 billion investment plan and the expectation of a resolution within one to two weeks are strong indicators of Apple's commitment to the Indonesian market, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. Previous predictions from various models also align with this positive sentiment, with most predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. The removal of a significant market barrier and the potential for increased sales in Southeast Asia further support this outlook. However, there is still a small chance of the stock price falling if the deal encounters unexpected hurdles or if broader market conditions negatively impact investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant dispute with Indonesia, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales due to local investment rules. Apple has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes setting up an AirTag factory, and Indonesian officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it removes a significant market barrier and adds to Apple's investment and revenue opportunities. The increase in investment commitment from $100 million to $1 billion indicates Apple is taking the Indonesian market seriously and will likely increase revenue. Given this positive outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales. The $1 billion investment plan and the expectation of a resolution within one to two weeks are positive indicators for the company and its investors. The removal of the sales ban in a significant Southeast Asian market is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, anticipating increased sales and market access. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which have mostly estimated a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, and taking into account the positive nature of the news, it's reasonable to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. The consistency in the reasoning across different models in previous rounds, highlighting the positive implications of resolving the dispute and the potential for increased sales, supports a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential resolution to a significant dispute between Apple and the Indonesian government, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. Multiple models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising, primarily based on the expected removal of a market barrier and the potential for increased sales and revenue in the Indonesian market. Although there is some indication of market stability and potential hurdles in finalizing the details, the overall sentiment from other predictions is strongly aligned with a positive stock movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
