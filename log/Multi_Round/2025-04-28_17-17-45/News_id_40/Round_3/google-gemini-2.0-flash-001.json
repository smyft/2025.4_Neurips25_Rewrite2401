(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Seeing iPhone Strength in Markets With AI\nNews Content: Apple Intelligence isn't available everywhere, but iPhone demand is stronger where the software is live, says CEO Tim Cook. On the conference call Thursday, Cook said that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger in places where the company has rolled out Apple Intelligence than where the software isn't yet available. \"The 16 outperformed the 15,\" Cook said.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence software is available, suggesting positive momentum for Apple's upcoming quarter. Tim Cook's comments about the iPhone 16 outperforming the 15 indicate a solid performance that may lead to increased investor confidence in the company's growth prospects. Overall, this positive news is likely to lead to an increase in the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a high probability of a price rise and a low probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a positive outlook for Apple, particularly regarding iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. CEO Tim Cook's statement highlighting the stronger performance of the iPhone 16 compared to the iPhone 15 in these regions indicates that Apple Intelligence is a driver for sales. This positive correlation could lead to increased investor confidence and, subsequently, a higher stock price. However, it is also important to remember that real-world impacts of AI on iPhone sales are yet to be seen. Overall the announcement suggests optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence, suggesting a positive correlation between the software and product demand.  This is a positive signal for Apple's future growth, as it implies the success of its AI integration strategy and strong consumer demand for its flagship product. While this is just one data point and doesn't guarantee sustained future growth, it contributes to a generally positive sentiment.  However, market reaction to news is complex and influenced by many factors beyond this single announcement; therefore, the probabilities reflect a degree of uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone 16 family is performing better year-over-year in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting strong demand linked to the AI features. This positive performance and the CEO's comments could boost investor confidence in Apple's product strategy and future revenue potential. Given this positive sentiment, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that iPhone demand, particularly for the iPhone 16 family, is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence has been rolled out. This suggests that the new software feature is positively impacting sales of Apple's latest iPhone models. Given that iPhone sales are a significant contributor to Apple's revenue, this information is likely to be viewed positively by investors. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, suggesting a positive impact on iPhone sales. This strength in iPhone sales can contribute to increased revenue and potentially better-than-expected earnings, which are typically positive factors for a company's stock price. Given this information, it's reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news report highlighted Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about stronger demand for the iPhone 16, especially in regions where Apple Intelligence is deployed. This suggests a positive correlation between the AI software and the performance of the iPhone 16 family, which is critical to Apple's revenue. The consensus from previous predictions shows a general optimism regarding the stock price movement based on these sales trends. Given the positive indications regarding product performance and consumer demand, it's reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news is definitively positive, indicating a correlation between Apple Intelligence availability and stronger iPhone sales. The CEO's direct statement about iPhone 16 outperforming iPhone 15 in relevant markets is also a strong signal. The previous round of predictions largely agreed on a higher probability of price increase. Considering this, and the fact that there's no conflicting negative information available, I will adjust the probabilities slightly higher while factoring in some market uncertainty always present.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news is positive, indicating strong iPhone 16 sales in markets with Apple Intelligence. This suggests a successful integration of AI features and positive consumer response.  However, this is limited to regions where Apple Intelligence is available and doesn't account for broader market factors or future performance. Previous models largely agree on a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. The consensus reflects a cautiously optimistic outlook, acknowledging the positive news but also acknowledging inherent market uncertainty.  Considering the previous predictions and the inherent limitations of the news itself, I'm slightly adjusting the probabilities to reflect a more conservative prediction than the highest prediction from previous rounds, accounting also for the single data point nature of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, with CEO Tim Cook noting that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in these regions. This suggests a positive impact on sales, which is a key driver of Apple's revenue. Given this positive momentum and the potential for increased investor confidence, the stock price is more likely to rise. However, market reactions can be influenced by other factors, so there's still some uncertainty. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of a rise, supporting this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's iPhone demand, particularly for the iPhone 16 family, is stronger in markets where Apple Intelligence has been rolled out. This positive correlation between the availability of Apple Intelligence and iPhone sales suggests that the integration of AI features is driving consumer demand. CEO Tim Cook's comments that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in these markets further reinforce the positive sentiment. Given that iPhone sales are a significant contributor to Apple's revenue, this information is likely to be viewed positively by investors. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling due to this news. Considering the overall positive tone and the implications for future revenue, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive correlation between the availability of Apple Intelligence and the demand for iPhone 16, with CEO Tim Cook stating that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. This suggests a strong sales performance driven by the integration of AI features, which could lead to increased investor confidence and a potential rise in the stock price. Considering the positive sentiment expressed by various models in previous rounds, with predictions ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 for a stock price rise, it's reasonable to align with the overall positive outlook while accounting for some degree of uncertainty and variability in market reactions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights strong iPhone demand and better year-over-year performance in regions where Apple Intelligence software has been deployed. CEO Tim Cook's confirmation of this correlation suggests that Apple's integration of artificial intelligence into their iPhones positively affects sales. Given that iPhone sales contribute significantly to Apple's overall revenue and profitability, such positive developments are likely to enhance investor confidence and support an uptick in the stock price. Previous predictions from various models also indicate a general expectation of a rise in stock price, aligning with the positive sentiment presented in this news. Consequently, there is a substantial anticipated increase in the stock price, despite considerations of market complexities.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone demand linked to the rollout of Apple Intelligence, with CEO Tim Cook indicating that the iPhone 16 has outperformed its predecessor in regions with this software. This suggests a positive correlation between software features and product performance, likely boosting investor confidence and pointing to potential revenue growth. Several previous predictions suggest a prevailing sentiment of optimism regarding the stock's upward movement. Based on this analysis, I estimate a high probability of a stock price rise, with a correspondingly lower probability of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news continues to be positive, with concrete evidence from Tim Cook about iPhone 16's outperformance where Apple Intelligence is available. Previous predictions consistently favored a price increase, clustering around 0.7. While the general market sentiment can shift unexpectedly, the underlying news is strong, suggesting sustained positive momentum. I will slightly increase to account for this positive momentum but maintain a degree of wariness for overall market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news is positive, indicating a correlation between Apple Intelligence and stronger iPhone 16 sales.  CEO Cook's statement directly supports this.  The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.  While the news is positive, I'm taking into account that this is just one data point, and  market reactions are complex.  The consensus among previous models, while leaning towards a price rise, isn't uniformly extreme, suggesting some degree of uncertainty remains. I'm therefore adjusting the probability slightly lower than the highest prediction in the previous round to reflect this.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news highlights strong iPhone 16 demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, with CEO Tim Cook confirming that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in these regions.

Previous predictions from various models consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. The overall sentiment is optimistic, though some uncertainty remains due to market complexities and the limited scope of the news (only regions with Apple Intelligence). Considering the strong positive indicators and consensus among previous predictions, I estimate a high probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive correlation between the availability of Apple Intelligence and the demand for iPhone 16, with CEO Tim Cook stating that the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 15 in markets where Apple Intelligence is available.
