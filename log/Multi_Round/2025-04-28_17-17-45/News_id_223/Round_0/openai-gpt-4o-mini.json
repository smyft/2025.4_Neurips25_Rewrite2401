(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\nNews Content: https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/barclays-price-target-raised-to-350-gbp-from-320-gbp-at-deutsche-bank\n\nDeutsche Bank raised the firm\u2019s price target on Barclays (BCS) to 350 GBp from 320 GBp and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Even if you give Barclays no credit for the least predictable parts of their strategy, the shares offer significant value, the firm told investors in a research note on Friday. Barclays trades at an implied cost of equity of 18%. There is clearly embedded skepticism in the valuation which Deutsche attributes to two primary factors, namely the plan to take market share in the investment bank on the same capital base, and growth in the U.S. consumer business but at much wider margins.\n\nInvest with Confidence:\n\nFollow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.

However, Apple Inc. is mentioned in the context of its relationship with Barclays but is not directly affected by the price target change. The news indicates positive analyst sentiment towards Barclays, which may indirectly reflect positively on Apple due to their potential partnerships in financial services. Yet, since the news directly does not pertain to Apple's business fundamentals, and considering the mixed market conditions, the impact on Apple\u2019s stock price may be limited. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of price increase while acknowledging potential downward pressures inherent in market movements.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
