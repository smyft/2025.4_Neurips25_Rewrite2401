Historical data shows that stocks that underperform in the short term can rebound strongly as investors look for value. Additionally, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which can contribute to its resilience and potential for recovery. However, the current sell-off may also be a sign of underlying issues or market sentiment, which could continue to weigh on the stock price. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, as investors may view the current price as a discount and seize the opportunity to buy.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
