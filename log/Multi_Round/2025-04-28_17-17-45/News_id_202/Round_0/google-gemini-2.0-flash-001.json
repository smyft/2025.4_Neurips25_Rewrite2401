However, it also frames this sell-off as a \\\"buying opportunity,\\\" implying that the current price may be undervalued. This contradictory aspect makes prediction challenging. Given the negative initial sentiment of underperformance, the probability of an immediate price drop might be slightly higher, but the explicit mention of a \\\"buying opportunity\\\" introduces uncertainty and the potential for a rebound.
