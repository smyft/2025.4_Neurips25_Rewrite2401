(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The comments by Jim Cramer reflect a mix of skepticism regarding Apple's current innovation trajectory, highlighted by Zuckerberg's criticism that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs. However, Cramer does not outright dismiss Apple's value; rather, he contrasts it with broader issues, including interest rates and market conditions affected by external factors like the California wildfires. Overall, the negative commentary regarding innovation could sway investor perception, but Cramer's broader market context and Apple's strong brand and revenue potential might temper the stock's decline. Given this analysis, there is a moderate probability of the stock price falling due to negative sentiment but also a fair chance of it rising given the company's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's commentary on various market factors and his reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death. While Cramer acknowledges Zuckerberg's criticism, he also expresses disbelief and counters with Apple's continued innovation and market position. However, the article also highlights Cramer's concerns about broader macroeconomic factors like interest rates, wildfires, and export controls, which could negatively impact the overall market and potentially Apple. The news is a mixed bag. The comments focus of Apple\u2019s innovation is slightly negative, but also notes Apple\u2019s continued market dominance. Weighing the positive and negative aspects, along with Cramer's broad market outlook, leads to a slightly higher probability of a price fall. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed. While he criticizes Zuckerberg's assessment of Apple's post-Jobs innovation, calling it \"one of the most offensive interviews I've heard,\" he doesn't offer a concrete negative outlook on Apple's stock.  The news piece focuses more on the broader economic concerns (California wildfires, interest rate hikes, geopolitical tensions) and Zuckerberg's comments which are largely irrelevant to the company's fundamental performance.  Cramer's criticism of Zuckerberg's perspective doesn't necessarily translate to a bearish outlook on AAPL. The article also mentions that Apple is ranked 3rd on Cramer's discussed stocks, implying at the least it is not in the worst performing category.  Given the absence of strong negative sentiment directed specifically at Apple's financial prospects, and considering the overall uncertainty reflected in Cramer's broader economic comments, the probabilities lean slightly towards a neutral outlook with a very slight bias towards a price rise (due to the general neutrality of the Cramer quote towards AAPL's stock and Apple's high market capitalization generally making it less volatile.)\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of broader market and economic issues, including California wildfires, interest rates, and Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Zuckerberg's comments could be seen as negative for Apple's reputation, the article does not provide concrete financial or operational data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Cramer's reaction to Zuckerberg's comments was mixed, and the broader discussion was more about market sentiment and external factors like wildfires and interest rates rather than Apple-specific fundamentals. Given the lack of direct negative or positive catalysts, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative due to the potential reputational risk from Zuckerberg's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in response to Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg stated that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death, which Cramer strongly disagreed with. Cramer defended Apple, suggesting that such negative comments are ill-advised. While Cramer's comments may provide short-term support, the overall impact of the news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the negative sentiment expressed by Zuckerberg, which may resonate with some investors. However, given Cramer's defense and the strong brand loyalty of Apple, the probabilities of a significant stock price movement are moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. and Mark Zuckerberg's recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Cramer criticized Zuckerberg's remarks about Apple not innovating since Steve Jobs' death, calling them 'ill-advised' and 'damning'. However, Cramer's comments do not seem to be overly negative towards Apple, and he appears to be defending the company. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple is a consumer electronics giant with a strong revenue stream from its iPhone sales. Considering this, the news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer dismisses the notion that nothing has been done since Steve Jobs' death as 'ill-advised,' which could positively influence investor sentiment. On the other hand, he criticizes the company's closed ecosystem and compares Apple to the 'axis of evil.' Additionally, broader economic concerns like wildfire impacts and governmental policy changes might create uncertainty. Thus, the overall message is mixed, with both positive and negative angles.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
