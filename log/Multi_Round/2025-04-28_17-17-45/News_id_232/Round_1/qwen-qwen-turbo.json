A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information in the article that would influence Apple's stock price positively or negatively. Therefore, the probabilities for AAPL's stock price movement remain neutral, suggesting low likelihoods for both rises and falls.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Nvidia's CEO and other Big Tech leaders attending or not attending Trump's inauguration. While it mentions Apple indirectly by associating it within the broader 'Big Tech' group, the core information revolves around Nvidia and potentially other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta. The fact that Nvidia's Huang is visiting China and Taiwan might have a very slight potential impact, depending on market perception and investor outlook on those trips. However, the overall impact on Apple (AAPL) specifically is likely negligible, as the article gives no information about Apple-specific events or initiatives. The market tends to react more strongly to news directly related to the company itself or the companies it's closely linked to. Considering the information, It is very unlikely to have a direct or indirect short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is irrelevant to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but provides no information about Apple or its stock. Therefore, the absence of the Nvidia CEO is unlikely to have any impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the absence of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang from President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not provide any direct financial implications or business-related announcements for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news is primarily about Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech CEOs' attendance at the inauguration, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at Trump's inauguration, specifically mentioning that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. or its executives. Therefore, this news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its business operations. The news discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. Since the news does not contain any significant information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate directly to AAPL, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
