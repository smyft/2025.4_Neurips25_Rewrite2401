A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration, which primarily concerns Nvidia and its executives rather than Apple Inc. While there could be indirect effects on the tech sector due to political sentiments, there is no direct information in the article that would influence Apple's stock price positively or negatively. Therefore, the probabilities for AAPL's stock price movement remain neutral, suggesting low likelihoods for both rises and falls.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily focus on Nvidia's CEO and other Big Tech leaders attending or not attending Trump's inauguration. While it mentions Apple indirectly by associating it within the broader 'Big Tech' group, the core information revolves around Nvidia and potentially other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta. The fact that Nvidia's Huang is visiting China and Taiwan might have a very slight potential impact, depending on market perception and investor outlook on those trips. However, the overall impact on Apple (AAPL) specifically is likely negligible, as the article gives no information about Apple-specific events or initiatives. The market tends to react more strongly to news directly related to the company itself or the companies it's closely linked to. Considering the information, It is very unlikely to have a direct or indirect short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is irrelevant to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but provides no information about Apple or its stock. Therefore, the absence of the Nvidia CEO is unlikely to have any impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the absence of Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang from President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not provide any direct financial implications or business-related announcements for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that the news is primarily about Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech CEOs' attendance at the inauguration, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at Trump's inauguration, specifically mentioning that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be attending due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. or its executives. Therefore, this news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its business operations. The news discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. Since the news does not contain any significant information about Apple Inc., it is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The given news item is about Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration and has no direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not relate directly to AAPL, it is unlikely to influence their stock price significantly.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and mentions other Big Tech executives without providing any direct relevance or implications for Apple Inc. Given that the focus is on Nvidia and there are no announcements or events concerning Apple, it is unlikely that this news will impact Apple's stock price. Previous predictions varied between very low probabilities for significant movement, with many suggesting an equal chance of rise and fall due to the irrelevance of the news to Apple's specific situation. Therefore, I predict very low probabilities for both rising and falling stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO not attending Trump's inauguration, which is primarily relevant to Nvidia and other big tech companies mentioned (Tesla, Amazon, Meta). The general trend in the previous rounds indicates a consensus that this news has a negligible impact on Apple's stock price because there is no direct or indirect connection between the content of the news and Apple's operations or financial conditions. Most models consistently predict very low probabilities of either a rise or fall. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the trend from prior predictions, the estimates remain very low.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO and other tech executives' attendance (or lack thereof) at President Trump's inauguration.  This news is largely irrelevant to Apple. There is no direct mention of Apple, its executives, or any company-specific events. While the broader tech sector might experience minor fluctuations based on general political sentiments, the likelihood of a significant impact on Apple's stock price due to this specific news is negligible.  The previous predictions consistently reflect this low probability of impact.  Therefore, the probabilities for a rise or fall in Apple's stock price remain very close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a specific focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan. The article does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its executives, nor does it provide any information that would directly impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.

However, it does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its business operations.

The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low, reflecting the minimal direct influence of the news on Apple Inc.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The core information does not involve specific news about Apple's performance, strategies, or events. While the tech sector could experience indirect implications based on the prevailing political climate, the absence of a CEO from an inauguration does not translate to immediate stock price movements for another company in the sector.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news primarily concerns Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and does not provide any direct relevance to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Most previous predictions indicated that the news is unlikely to have any significant impact on Apple's stock price since it focuses on other companies and events not directly related to Apple. As such, it's reasonable to predict very low probabilities for both rising and falling of AAPL's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration and the attendance of other Big Tech executives. This news is primarily relevant to Nvidia and the companies whose CEOs are attending the inauguration. There is no direct or indirect impact on Apple's operations, financial performance, or strategic initiatives. The consensus from previous prediction rounds indicates minimal to no impact on Apple's stock price due to the lack of relevance. The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are, therefore, estimated to be minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration, which is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There is no direct mention of Apple in the news. While the broader tech sector might react to general political sentiment, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely negligible.  The consensus among previous predictions strongly supports this, showing consistently low probabilities for both price increases and decreases.  Therefore, the probabilities of a significant stock price movement are very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip, along with mentions of other Big Tech executives attending the event. There is no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any information that would impact Apple's business operations or financial performance. Given the lack of relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have any significant effect on AAPL's stock price. Previous predictions from multiple models also consistently indicate minimal probabilities for any stock price movement due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration due to a preplanned business trip to China and Taiwan.

(AAPL). The core information does not involve specific news about Apple's performance, strategies, or events. While the tech sector could experience indirect implications based on the prevailing political climate, the absence of a CEO from an inauguration does not translate to immediate stock price movements for another company in the sector. Additionally, the overwhelming consensus from previous predictions suggests very low probabilities of stock price movement for AAPL.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and does not provide any direct relevance to Apple Inc. (AAPL). All previous predictions indicate that the news is unlikely to impact Apple's stock price due to its focus on Nvidia and other Big Tech executives. There are no company-specific events or implications for Apple in the news, leading to a consensus of very low probabilities for either a rise or a fall in AAPL's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.0, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.0, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration and mentions other Big Tech executives attending. The consensus from previous rounds is that this news is highly unlikely to have any direct or indirect impact on Apple's stock price due to the lack of relevance to Apple's operations, financial performance, or strategic plans. Therefore, the probability of either a rise or fall in Apple's stock price as a result of this news is minimal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO's absence from Trump's inauguration. This event is largely irrelevant to Apple.  There is no direct mention of Apple, its business, or its executives. While broader market sentiment might be subtly affected by general political news, the likelihood of a direct impact on Apple's stock price is extremely low. The overwhelming consensus across multiple prediction rounds from various models strongly supports this conclusion.  All previous predictions converge on minimal probabilities for both price increases and decreases, indicating near-zero relevance to Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and mentions other Big Tech executives attending the event.
