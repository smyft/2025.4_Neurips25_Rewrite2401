While it mentions Apple indirectly by associating it within the broader 'Big Tech' group, the core information revolves around Nvidia and potentially other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta. The fact that Nvidia's Huang is visiting China and Taiwan might have a very slight potential impact, depending on market perception and investor outlook on those trips. However, the overall impact on Apple (AAPL) specifically is likely negligible, as the article gives no information about Apple-specific events or initiatives. The market tends to react more strongly to news directly related to the company itself or the companies it's closely linked to. Considering the information, It is very unlikely to have a direct or indirect short-term impact on Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang won't be at Trump's inauguration\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
