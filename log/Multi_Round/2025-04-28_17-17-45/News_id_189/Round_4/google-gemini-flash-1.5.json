(AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the market as a leading cash app stock according to hedge funds, with the company ranking second on a list of the best cash app stocks. The robust growth in Apple's revenue driven by its services segment, particularly Apple Pay and Wallet, as well as record iPhone sales, indicates a solid operational performance. Additionally, the article discusses the substantial growth of Cash App but also points out the controversies and legal challenges faced by its parent company, Block, which doesn't directly impact Apple but reflects the competitive landscape. Overall, the positive sentiment around Apple and its continual innovation and ecosystem strength suggest a higher likelihood of price increase. However, the potential for broader market fluctuations remains, which introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the probabilities are slightly skewed toward a stock price rise in light of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article analyzes Apple's position relative to other stocks potentially available on Cash App, driven by hedge fund sentiment. While it highlights Apple's strong financial performance, market dominance through its ecosystem (iPhone, Apple Pay, etc.), and sustainability efforts, it also implies that other AI focused companies might offer better short-term returns. Hedge fund ownership is a slightly positive factor. The reference to Apple's Wallet and Apple Pay being elements of the 'Services' business is a positive signal. However, the article concluding other AI stocks might be more promising creates mixed sentiment. Ultimately, the direct impact on AAPL's stock price is debatable. Considering the mix, a slightly higher chance for the stock price to remain stable or undergo a small increase relative to a decrease. The article doesn't give a strong reason for a significant rise in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the price rising will be a little higher than the probability of the price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong performance, particularly its record revenue and growth in services, iPhone sales, and emerging markets.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best Cash App stocks' suggests positive investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple is ranked second on the list, implying that other companies are considered even more promising investment opportunities by hedge funds.  Furthermore, the article focuses heavily on the overall performance and growth of Cash App, rather than on Apple itself.  The mention of Apple's inclusion is secondary to the primary focus on Cash App's performance.  Therefore, while the news is generally positive for Apple, the overall impact on its stock price is likely to be muted due to the secondary nature of the Apple discussion within a broader context of Cash App investment analysis. The relatively high number of hedge fund holders (158) already reflects a significant level of investment already present. This suggests the market may have largely priced-in this positive information already.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights several positive aspects of Apple Inc. (AAPL), including its strong Services business segment, record revenue growth, and innovative product lineup. The company's performance in emerging markets like India and its sustainability efforts also contribute to a positive outlook. Additionally, the mention of hedge fund interest and its ranking as the 2nd best cash app stock further supports potential growth. However, the news also notes challenges faced by Cash App, such as regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could have a slight negative impact. Overall, the positive factors outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with a large number of hedge funds holding the stock. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, has contributed to its dominance in the consumer electronics sector. The article also highlights Apple's record revenue and progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, due to the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence in the Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay. It also discusses strong financial performance with record-breaking revenue and services growth. However, it mentions Apple ranks as the 2nd among cash app stocks favored by hedge funds, suggesting slightly lower confidence compared to the leading stock. The news also references ongoing developments like AI advancements and environmental goals. Although positive, this information reflects a nuanced view with a slight preference towards other AI stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong market position as the second-best cash app stock favored by hedge funds, supported by significant revenue growth in its Services segment, including Apple Pay and Wallet. The mention of record iPhone sales and a growing ecosystem contributes positively to investor sentiment. However, the potential for competition from AI-focused stocks and the issues faced by Cash App might temper bullish expectations. Overall, while there are several positive factors supporting the stock, some mixed signals lead to a measured outlook on the extent of price appreciation. Therefore, a slight lean towards an increase in stock price due to the overall positive momentum is justified, along with acknowledgement of possible volatility.  Thus, the probabilities are estimated to be 0.60 for rising and 0.40 for falling, which is a slight inclination towards a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The previous predictions mostly lean towards a slight rise in Apple's stock price, citing the company's strong performance, inclusion in a list of top cash app stocks according to hedge funds, and overall positive sentiment. However, some models also noted that other AI stocks might be considered more promising and the article focuses primarily on Cash App's performance, diluting the direct impact on Apple. Given that most of the prior predictions show a mild positive sentiment and no dramatically negative information, I will stay within the general range from past turns. The fact that apple is ranked second indicates slight uncertainty about whether Apple's stock price will rise. Some negative events with Cash App also indicate uncertainty. I'm nudging it slightly down from some of the previous higher predictions to reflect this mixed sentiment and the potential for other opportunities to be viewed as better in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news piece is mixed. While it highlights Apple's strong financial performance, record revenue, and growth in its services segment,  the key takeaway is its placement as the *second* best Cash App stock according to hedge funds. This suggests that while Apple is performing well, other companies are perceived as having even greater potential.  Further, the article focuses primarily on Cash App's performance and the controversies surrounding its parent company, which indirectly influences the narrative. The large number of hedge funds already invested in Apple (158) suggests that much of the positive news might already be reflected in the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiment, the overall impact on AAPL's stock price from this news is likely to be minor. The previous predictions range widely, but lean slightly toward a rise, a sentiment I partially agree with given Apple's fundamentals, but tempered by the article's comparative assessment.   I am accounting for the fact that the article focuses more on Cash App and implicitly suggests stronger competitors exist.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as a strong contender among cash app stocks favored by hedge funds, ranking second on the list. The company's robust Services segment, including Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, along with record revenue and strong growth in emerging markets like India, underscores its financial health and innovation. Additionally, Apple's sustainability initiatives and ecosystem strength are noted as positive factors. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds view other AI stocks as having greater short-term potential, which could temper investor enthusiasm slightly. The overall sentiment leans positive, but the secondary focus on Cash App's challenges (not directly impacting Apple) and the comparison to other stocks introduce minor uncertainty. Given this, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the market as a leading cash app stock according to hedge funds, with a large number of hedge funds holding the stock. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, has contributed to its dominance in the consumer electronics sector. The article also highlights Apple's record revenue and progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive sentiment around Apple and its continual innovation and ecosystem strength, as well as the mixed views from other models, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence as a key player in the Services business segment with Apple Wallet and Apple Pay. The article also discusses strong financial performance, with record-breaking revenue and growth in services, as well as emerging market performance like India. Apple ranks second among the best cash app stocks favored by hedge funds, supporting its robust appeal to investors. Although there is reference to challenges faced by Cash App, which includes regulatory fines and fraud allegations, the overall sentiment remains optimistic due to the strong financial indicators, record revenue, and sustained growth in services. The mixed signals from various predictions point to a balanced market view. However, considering all the positive aspects highlighted, the overall probability leans slightly towards a rise in stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news highlights Apple's strong position in the market, particularly in the mobile payments segment through its services like Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. The increase in revenue and market growth are positive signals for investor sentiment. However, Apple's ranking as the second-best cash app stock according to hedge funds suggests some competition and mixed sentiment surrounding alternative investment opportunities, particularly in AI-focused stocks. Additionally, while the news emphasizes Apple\u2019s strong performance, it does also mention challenges faced by the Cash App platform, causing some uncertainty around immediate price movements. Overall, the majority of previous predictions tend to lean slightly towards a rise in stock price, albeit with mixed signals that temper overall bullish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article presents a moderately positive view of Apple. Its inclusion as a top cash app stock according to hedge funds, strong revenue growth, and expansion in services like Apple Pay contribute favorably. However, the article also acknowledges that other AI stocks may offer higher returns, and the primary focus on Cash App dilutes the direct positive impact on $AAPL. Prior rounds of predictions also reflect this mixed sentiment, generally leaning towards a slight price increase, but not overwhelmingly. Given that Apple is already heavily invested in (high number of hedge fund holders), the impact of this news may be dampened. I will adjust the probability slightly down due to the possibility that other opportunities could be better in short term and that the focus on Cash App. The consensus is only moderately positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is positive for Apple, highlighting its strong performance and inclusion among top Cash App stocks favored by hedge funds.  Record revenue, growth in services (Apple Pay, Apple Wallet), and expansion in emerging markets are significant positives. However, the article's focus on Cash App and the mention of other AI stocks as potentially more promising short-term investments temper the bullish sentiment.  The fact that Apple is ranked second, not first, on the list of preferred stocks further suggests that the market may not react strongly to this particular news.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities leaning slightly towards a price rise, I am assigning a probability that accounts for the mixed signals.  The predominantly positive fundamental news is weighed against the less-than-overwhelming nature of this specific announcement and the potential for other investment opportunities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong position as a leading cash app stock according to hedge funds, with a significant number of hedge fund holders. The company's robust Services segment, including Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, along with record revenue and growth in emerging markets, underscores its financial health and innovation.

However, it also mentions that other AI-focused stocks might offer better short-term returns, which introduces some uncertainty. Apple's ranking as the second-best cash app stock and its robust financial performance, including a strong iPhone and services revenue, contribute to a positive outlook. The controversies surrounding Cash App's parent company and regulatory challenges do not directly impact Apple but could influence investor sentiment indirectly. Overall, the positive factors such as strong financial performance, growth in services, and sustainability efforts outweigh the potential negatives, suggesting a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.41, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting its strong presence in the Services business segment, record revenue, and growth in emerging markets. Apple's ranking as the second-best cash app stock according to hedge funds, its robust ecosystem, and sustainability initiatives are also noted as positive factors. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds view other AI stocks as having greater short-term potential, which introduces minor uncertainty. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the mixed views from other models, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s significant presence as a key player in the Services business segment with Apple Wallet and Apple Pay.

The mixed signals from various predictions point to a balanced market view. However, considering all the positive aspects highlighted, the overall probability leans slightly towards a rise in stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news shows a generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), emphasizing its strong market position, particularly in the payment service sector through Apple Pay and Wallet. Record revenue growth and a solid performance in emerging markets, alongside increased hedge fund interest, indicate positive investor sentiment. However, the article's mention of Apple's ranking as the second-best cash app stock and the competitive edge of other AI stocks introduces some caution, suggesting that while AAPL is positioned well, there may be better opportunities elsewhere. The mixed signals from previous analyses reflect a modest but optimistic forecast for AAPL's stock price movement, resulting in a slightly higher probability for a price rise over a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news article paints a moderately positive picture of Apple. The key points are: 1) Apple is considered a top cash app stock by hedge funds, ranking second. This implies some positive sentiment. 2) Apple has strong financials, with record revenue and growth in its services segment (Apple Pay, Apple Wallet). 3) However, the article mentions other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns, suggesting some opportunities are considered more attractive. 4) The article focuses heavily on Cash App and its parent company's issues, indirectly impacting Apple's narrative. 5) A large number of hedge funds already hold AAPL, meaning the news may already be priced in, so I decrease the probability of stock price rising. 6) Finally, previous predictions have consistently leaned towards a slight rise. Considering these factors, while the overall sentiment is slightly positive, the potential for better returns elsewhere and the indirect impact of Cash App issues temper the enthusiasm. I'm thus nudging the probability of a rise to just above neutral, with a slightly reduced likelihood of an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is positive for Apple, highlighting its strong financial performance and inclusion among top Cash App stocks favored by hedge funds.  Record revenue, growth in services (Apple Pay, Apple Wallet), and expansion in emerging markets are significant positives.

The previous predictions show a range of probabilities leaning slightly towards a price rise, which I largely agree with. The predominantly positive fundamental news is weighed against the less-than-overwhelming nature of this specific announcement and the potential for other investment opportunities.  Considering the overall mixed sentiment and the fact that much of Apple's strong performance is likely already priced into the stock, I'm assigning a probability slightly lower than some of the previous predictions that reflect a more cautious outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc.

The predominantly positive fundamental news is weighed against the less-than-overwhelming nature of this specific announcement and the potential for other investment opportunities. The consistent predictions around 0.6 probability of a rise and 0.4 probability of a fall suggest a moderate positive impact, but not a dramatic one.  Considering the overall mixed sentiment and that much of Apple's strong performance is likely already priced into the stock, I am maintaining a similar probability range.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Is Apple Inc.
