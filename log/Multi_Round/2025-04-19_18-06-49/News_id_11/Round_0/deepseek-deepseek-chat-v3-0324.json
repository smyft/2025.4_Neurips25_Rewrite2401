Here's what the CEOs of Apple, Meta and Microsoft are saying\nNews Content: The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
