(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trending tickers: Apple, Intel, Novartis, Shell, Smiths Group\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL)\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday, following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn.

For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure.
