(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\nNews Content: The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption and expenditures index, rose 0.3% from November and 2.6% on an annual basis.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.45, 'fall_prediction': 0.55, 'reasoning': \"The news indicates a broader market concern with the Dow Jones diving due to external factors like Trump's tariff order, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple and Nvidia are mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting some resilience or positive momentum in their stocks. The inflation data could also influence market dynamics, but the immediate impact seems to lean towards caution in the market overall. Therefore, while there is some potential for Apple to rise due to its strong performance, the prevailing market sentiment may lead to a higher probability of a price fall.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.3, 'fall_prediction': 0.7, 'reasoning': \"The news headline indicates negative pressure on the Dow Jones due to Trump's tariff order. It also mentions Apple breaking key levels, which usually implies a downward trend. The inflation data (PCE index rising) could be interpreted negatively as it might lead to the Fed maintaining higher interest rates for longer, which is generally unfavorable for growth stocks like Apple. While the article mentions MicroStrategy's move, its direct impact on Apple is unclear and likely minimal. Considering these factors, the negative aspects seem to outweigh any potential positives.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-flash-1.5', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.3, 'fall_prediction': 0.7, 'reasoning': \"The news headline mentions that Apple broke a key level, suggesting a negative short-term trend.  The broader market context is also negative, with the Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order. While the inflation data (PCE) is relevant to the overall economy and could impact Apple indirectly, the headline's focus is on the immediate negative impact of the tariff order and Apple's price action.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following this news.  However, it's important to note that this is a short-term prediction based on limited information and the actual impact could be different.\"}\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.3, 'fall_prediction': 0.7, 'reasoning': 'The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to a Trump tariff order and mentions that Apple (AAPL) has broken key levels, which typically suggests a bearish trend. Additionally, the rise in the PCE index (a key inflation gauge) could signal concerns about inflation, potentially leading to tighter monetary policy, which is generally negative for growth stocks like Apple. The combination of tariff concerns, technical breakdown, and inflation worries likely increases downside risk for AAPL in the short term.'}\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'meta-llama/llama-4-scout', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.3, 'fall_prediction': 0.7, 'reasoning': \"The news headline mentions that the Dow Jones dives due to Trump's tariff order, and specifically notes that Apple (AAPL) breaks key levels. This suggests a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the content mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge rising, which could influence market sentiment and potentially affect stock prices. Given that Apple is a major company with significant global presence, tariff-related news and overall market trends can impact its stock. The breaking of key levels by Apple implies a potential downward movement.
