      "content": "```\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news headline mentions that the Dow Jones dives due to Trump's tariff order, and specifically notes that Apple (AAPL) breaks key levels. This suggests a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the content mentions the Fed's preferred inflation gauge rising, which could influence market sentiment and potentially affect stock prices. Given that Apple is a major company with significant global presence, tariff-related news and overall market trends can impact its stock. The breaking of key levels by Apple implies a potential downward movement. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
