However, Apple and Nvidia are mentioned as breaking key levels, suggesting some resilience or positive momentum in their stocks. The inflation data could also influence market dynamics, but the immediate impact seems to lean towards caution in the market overall. Therefore, while there is some potential for Apple to rise due to its strong performance, the prevailing market sentiment may lead to a higher probability of a price fall.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.3, 'fall_prediction': 0.7, 'reasoning': \"The news headline indicates negative pressure on the Dow Jones due to Trump's tariff order.

The inflation data (PCE index rising) could be interpreted negatively as it might lead to the Fed maintaining higher interest rates for longer, which is generally unfavorable for growth stocks like Apple. While the article mentions MicroStrategy's move, its direct impact on Apple is unclear and likely minimal.

While the inflation data (PCE) is relevant to the overall economy and could impact Apple indirectly, the headline's focus is on the immediate negative impact of the tariff order and Apple's price action.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following this news.  However, it's important to note that this is a short-term prediction based on limited information and the actual impact could be different.\"}\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.3, 'fall_prediction': 0.7, 'reasoning': 'The news headline indicates a negative market sentiment due to a Trump tariff order and mentions that Apple (AAPL) has broken key levels, which typically suggests a bearish trend.

Given that Apple is a major company with significant global presence, tariff-related news and overall market trends can impact its stock.

While one model (qwen/qwen-turbo) deviated with a slightly higher probability of a price rise, the consensus leans towards a negative outlook.

The rising PCE index adds another layer of complexity, potentially signaling further interest rate hikes and impacting growth stocks like Apple negatively.  The initial predictions are quite varied, with some leaning heavily towards a price fall (0.7 probability) and others showing more optimism (0.55 probability of a rise).
