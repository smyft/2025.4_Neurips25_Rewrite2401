(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price.
