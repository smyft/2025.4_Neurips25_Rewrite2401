(AAPL) as being affected. However, the article title 'DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7' and the mention of Wall Street's concerns being overblown suggests that the impact on the mentioned companies, including potentially Apple, might be limited. Given that Apple is not directly implicated in the vulnerability, the news is likely to have a minimal direct impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, as a major player in the tech industry, any significant shifts in the landscape could indirectly affect Apple. The overall tone of the article seems to downplay the concerns, which could lead to a slight positive movement for Apple's stock as investors might view the situation as less severe than initially thought.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7.
