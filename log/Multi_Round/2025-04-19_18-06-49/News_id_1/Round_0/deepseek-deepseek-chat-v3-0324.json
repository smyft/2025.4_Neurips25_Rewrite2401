(AAPL). While the headline implies potential negative impacts on these companies, the content also mentions that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown. This indicates a mixed sentiment. Apple's stock price could be affected by concerns over competition in the AI space, but the overblown nature of the concerns might mitigate significant negative impact. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative reaction due to initial market sensitivity to competitive threats.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7.
