In fact, if Wall Street's concerns are overblown, it could lead to a positive sentiment for Apple as investors may seek stability in its stock amidst the volatility of its competitors. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling, but the overall market sentiment could still lead to some downward pressure.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.4, 'fall_prediction': 0.6, 'reasoning': \"The news headline focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model on other 'Mag 7' companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, suggesting potential competitive pressure and vulnerability. While the article claims Wall Street's concerns might be overblown, the initial impact is likely negative sentiment towards the affected companies. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Mag 7' group, so there is a chance that the news will affect the stock price. However, the article does not focus on Apple specifically, and the impact is likely to be less than on companies directly involved in AI model development. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-flash-1.5', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.45, 'fall_prediction': 0.45, 'reasoning': \"The news article discusses the emergence of a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, posing a threat to several tech giants including Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.

Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minimal. Any price movement would probably be driven by broader market sentiment rather than this specific news.

Apple's stock price could be affected by concerns over competition in the AI space, but the overblown nature of the concerns might mitigate significant negative impact.

Nevertheless, as a major player in the tech industry, any significant shifts in the landscape could indirectly affect Apple.
