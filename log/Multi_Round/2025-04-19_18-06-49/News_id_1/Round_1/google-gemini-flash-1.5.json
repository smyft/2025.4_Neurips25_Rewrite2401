A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.65, 'fall_prediction': 0.35, 'reasoning': \"The news highlights a competitive threat to major tech companies, including Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, due to a cheaper AI model. While this could create concerns about market share and profitability for these companies, Apple is not directly mentioned as being affected by this specific news. In fact, if Wall Street's concerns are overblown, it could lead to a positive sentiment for Apple as investors may seek stability in its stock amidst the volatility of its competitors. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling, but the overall market sentiment could still lead to some downward pressure.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.4, 'fall_prediction': 0.6, 'reasoning': \"The news headline focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model on other 'Mag 7' companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, suggesting potential competitive pressure and vulnerability. While the article claims Wall Street's concerns might be overblown, the initial impact is likely negative sentiment towards the affected companies. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Mag 7' group, so there is a chance that the news will affect the stock price. However, the article does not focus on Apple specifically, and the impact is likely to be less than on companies directly involved in AI model development. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\"}\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'google/gemini-flash-1.5', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.45, 'fall_prediction': 0.45, 'reasoning': \"The news article discusses the emergence of a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, posing a threat to several tech giants including Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.  However, the article also suggests that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown.  Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned in the news as being significantly impacted by DeepSeek. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minimal. Any price movement would probably be driven by broader market sentiment rather than this specific news.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are close to equal, slightly favoring a neutral stance.\"}\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.45, 'fall_prediction': 0.55, 'reasoning': \"The news headline suggests that the introduction of a cheaper AI model by DeepSeek has exposed vulnerabilities in several major tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the headline implies potential negative impacts on these companies, the content also mentions that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown. This indicates a mixed sentiment. Apple's stock price could be affected by concerns over competition in the AI space, but the overblown nature of the concerns might mitigate significant negative impact. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative reaction due to initial market sensitivity to competitive threats.\"}\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'meta-llama/llama-4-scout', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.6, 'fall_prediction': 0.4, 'reasoning': \"The news headline mentions that a cheaper AI model, DeepSeek, has exposed vulnerabilities for several major companies including Nvidia, Amazon.com, and Alphabet. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the context of being vulnerable or directly impacted. Given that the news does not directly target Apple, and considering that the article suggests Wall Street's concerns might be overblown, it's reasonable to infer that Apple's stock might not be significantly negatively affected.

However, the article title 'DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7' and the mention of Wall Street's concerns being overblown suggests that the impact on the mentioned companies, including potentially Apple, might be limited. Given that Apple is not directly implicated in the vulnerability, the news is likely to have a minimal direct impact on Apple's stock price. Nevertheless, as a major player in the tech industry, any significant shifts in the landscape could indirectly affect Apple. The overall tone of the article seems to downplay the concerns, which could lead to a slight positive movement for Apple's stock as investors might view the situation as less severe than initially thought.\"}\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3,Reasoning: {'model_name': 'qwen/qwen-turbo', 'round': 0, 'rise_prediction': 0.4, 'fall_prediction': 0.3, 'reasoning': \"The financial news discusses a new AI model from a company called DeepSeek that could potentially expose vulnerabilities for major tech companies such as Nvidia, Amazon.com, Alphabet, etc. However, it also mentions that Wall Street's concerns may be overblown.
