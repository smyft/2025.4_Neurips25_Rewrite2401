Overall, the clarification from the EU may lead to a slight positive sentiment, but the geopolitical context introduces some risk.

However, the headline does not mention any immediate fines or actions against Apple specifically, which may limit the immediate impact.

Given that the news does not contain any directly negative or positive information specific to Apple Inc., the impact on its stock price is likely to be neutral.

Given that the article does not contain any specific negative news about Apple's financial performance or operations, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal.
