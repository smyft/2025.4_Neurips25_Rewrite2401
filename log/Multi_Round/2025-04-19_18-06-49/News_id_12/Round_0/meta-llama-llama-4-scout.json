This suggests a positive market reaction to the news, which could imply that Apple's stock price may also rise due to the overall favorable market sentiment. However, the news is not specific to Apple Inc., so the impact might be general. Given that the inflation gauge met expectations, it did not exceed them, which could limit the upside.
