(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline relates to investing in glass stocks, which does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its involvement in the glass industry. Without a clear connection to Apple, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling based on this news are both low, with a slight bias towards it remaining stable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Glass Stocks\" is extremely vague. It doesn't specify which \"glass stocks\" Apple is investing in, the size of the investment, or the rationale behind it. Without more specific information, it's impossible to assess the potential impact on Apple's stock price. The market's reaction could depend on whether investors view the investment as strategic, innovative, or financially risky. Due to the ambiguity and lack of substance in the news, I'm assigning a relatively equal probability to a rise or fall, but factoring in the possibility of 'no change' by slightly reducing both rise and fall probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Broadcom's (AVGO) strong performance and future outlook, driven by the AI boom.  While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a beneficiary of Broadcom's AI-related products, the connection is indirect. The positive news about Broadcom doesn't directly translate into a specific, quantifiable impact on Apple's stock price.  The article provides no information about Apple's own financial performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and influenced more by other market factors than this specific news. We can assume a slightly higher probability of a rise due to the general positive sentiment in the tech sector fueled by AI advancements, but the effect is likely to be small and diluted by broader market forces.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' is vague and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or how it directly relates to the company's operations, products, or financial performance. Without clear relevance or impact on Apple's business, the news is unlikely to significantly influence the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal and largely speculative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China has declined in 2024, while domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have gained momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and that the iPhone's premium offerings are still in demand. The overall smartphone market is expected to grow, but Apple's declining market share in China might offset some of these gains. Given this mixed information, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share declined in China, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum in 2024. This decline in market share could potentially negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability. However, the news also mentions that Apple continued to grow in non-core markets and that the company's premium offerings, such as the Pro series devices, are gaining traction. Additionally, the global smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024, which could be a positive sign for the industry as a whole. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and diversification.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant growth and positive projections for Broadcom, including robust revenue increases, strong performance in key segments like AI, and a steady increase in dividends. The forecasted surge in demand from major players such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Apple suggests substantial future earnings potential. While there are mentioned risks related to customers like Bytedance, the overall sentiment and analyst recommendation are highly positive. Given these aspects, the probability of AAPL rising due to its mention as an additional demand source for Broadcom is moderately high.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' is vague and does not create a direct link to Apple Inc.'s core business or performance. Given that previous analyses indicate a lack of specific information regarding the investment, the potential impact on Apple's stock price is minimal. While some analysts display slightly higher probabilities of price movement due to broader market sentiment, the ambiguity and lack of concrete information about how this investment relates to Apple suggest that major shifts in stock price are unlikely. Thus, a conservative estimate reflects low probabilities for both upward and downward movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Glass Stocks\" is incredibly generic. It provides no specific information about Apple's involvement, the type of glass, the amount invested, or any strategic context. The prior round predictions reflect this ambiguity, with most models indicating negligible impact or assigning roughly equal probabilities of a rise or fall. Some models even interpreted previous, different news. Considering the lack of concrete information and the varied interpretations previously, I would lean toward a minimal impact on Apple's stock price. I will keep the probabilities relatively neutral but slightly favor a small price increase given the slight uptick in tech investments generally.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's strong performance driven by AI, mentioning Apple as a beneficiary of Broadcom's AI-related products.  The connection is indirect, however; Apple's own performance isn't directly addressed. While the positive news about Broadcom might indirectly boost sentiment toward Apple (due to the positive association), the impact is likely to be small and diluted by other market factors.  The previous predictions show significant disagreement, highlighting the uncertainty and the indirect nature of the news' impact. Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials and the uncertainty reflected in the previous models' predictions, I assign a relatively low probability to both price increases and decreases, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the general positive sentiment around AI and Broadcom's success.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' is vague and does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its involvement in the glass industry. Previous predictions from various models show mixed reactions, with some assigning low probabilities due to the lack of direct relevance, while others consider indirect positive effects from related sectors like AI. Given the ambiguity and lack of specific information about Apple's role in this news, the impact on its stock price is likely minimal. However, considering the slight positive sentiment from some models and the general stability of Apple's stock, the probability of a rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China declined in 2024, while domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi gained momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and that the iPhone's premium offerings are still in demand. The overall smartphone market is expected to grow, but Apple's declining market share in China might offset some of these gains. Considering the mixed information and the current stock price action (down 0.54% at $230.83), there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share declined in China, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum in 2024. This decline in market share could potentially negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability. However, the news also mentions that Apple continued to grow in non-core markets and that the company's premium offerings, such as the Pro series devices, are gaining traction. Additionally, the global smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024, which could be a positive sign for the industry as a whole. Considering these factors and the previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still possible due to Apple's strong brand and diversification.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant growth and positive projections for Broadcom, including robust revenue increases, strong performance in key segments like AI, and a steady increase in dividends. The forecasted surge in demand from major players such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Apple suggests substantial future earnings potential. While there are mentioned risks related to customers like Bytedance, the overall sentiment and analyst recommendation are highly positive. Given these aspects, the probability of AAPL rising due to its mention as an additional demand source for Broadcom is moderately high.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' is vague and does not specify any direct impact on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) business or financial performance. Previous predictions reflect a consensus that the news lacks substantial relevance to Apple's core operations, with models showing divided sentiments about potential price movement. Many models indicated low probabilities for both rising and falling, maintaining a conservative stance due to the ambiguity of the news. However, a slight positive sentiment in tech stocks and indirect benefits from broader market trends could suggest a marginally higher chance of price rise. Therefore, I estimate a modest probability of price rise slightly outweighing the fall probability.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' is still incredibly vague and provides no specific information regarding Apple's direct involvement or financial impact. Previous rounds of predictions reflect this uncertainty, leading to a wide range of estimates. Some models assumed connections to the glass used in Apple products, while others interpreted it as a general tech investment trend. Considering the continued ambiguity, I will adjust my prediction to reflect a more neutral stance, acknowledging that the information is too nonspecific to significantly influence the stock price in either direction. However, i would give slightly higher probability to stock price rising, based on the general sentiment indicated by previous models.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's strong performance in the AI sector, driven by increased demand from major tech companies including Apple.  While the relationship is indirect (Apple's own financials aren't discussed), the positive news about Broadcom could boost investor sentiment towards Apple, as increased Broadcom revenue suggests a healthy tech sector and potential positive spillover effects for Apple's business.  However, the impact is likely to be small and indirect. The previous predictions show considerable disagreement, reflecting the ambiguity of the news' effect on Apple's stock price.  Considering this indirect relationship and the uncertainty reflected in previous model predictions, I'm assigning a relatively low probability to both a price rise and fall, with a slight lean towards a rise due to potential positive market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Glass Stocks' is vague and lacks direct connection to Apple Inc. (AAPL), making its impact on the stock price uncertain. Previous predictions show mixed reactions, ranging from minimal impact to slight positive sentiment due to indirect factors like AI-related benefits from Broadcom. Given the ambiguity and lack of specific information about Apple's involvement, the probabilities of a significant stock price movement remain low. However, considering the general positive sentiment in the tech sector and some indirect benefits, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China declined in 2024, while domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi gained momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and that the iPhone's premium offerings are still in demand.

Considering the mixed information and the current stock price action (down 0.54% at $230.83), there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising, but the probabilities are close due to the mixed nature of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share declined in China, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum in 2024.
