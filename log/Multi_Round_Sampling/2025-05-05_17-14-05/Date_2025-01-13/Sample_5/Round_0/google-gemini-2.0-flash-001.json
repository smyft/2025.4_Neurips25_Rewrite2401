For Apple (AAPL), this puts significant pressure on them to deliver strong earnings. If Apple's earnings meet or exceed expectations, the stock will likely rise. However, if earnings disappoint, given the heightened expectations and overall market dependence on corporate performance, the stock could experience a more significant drop than usual. I will assume the market expects good news more than poor news, leaving slightly less pressure on Apple. But given the focus on rate cuts not happening as quickly as expected, there is a general level of unease in the market. I estimate the stock price reaction as slightly more positive than negative, with approximately 0.55 probability it will rise. Considering potential for earnings disappointment, I give a 0.45 probability that the stock falls.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
