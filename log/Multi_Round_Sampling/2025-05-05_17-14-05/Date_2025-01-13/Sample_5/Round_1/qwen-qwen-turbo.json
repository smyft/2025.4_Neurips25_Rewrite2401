(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the smartphone market, losing market share to Samsung. While Apple shows strength in certain markets and the Pro variants are selling well in China, the overall decline in global market share and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series may contribute negatively to investor sentiment. Discounts on iPhone models in China suggest a need to maintain competitiveness, which could also reflect concerns about long-term growth. Overall, the negative news could weigh on the stock price more than any positive sentiment from growth in other regions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests market sentiment is relying heavily on corporate earnings to sustain the stock rally because interest rate cuts are less likely in the near future. For Apple (AAPL), this puts significant pressure on them to deliver strong earnings. If Apple's earnings meet or exceed expectations, the stock will likely rise. However, if earnings disappoint, given the heightened expectations and overall market dependence on corporate performance, the stock could experience a more significant drop than usual. I will assume the market expects good news more than poor news, leaving slightly less pressure on Apple. But given the focus on rate cuts not happening as quickly as expected, there is a general level of unease in the market. I estimate the stock price reaction as slightly more positive than negative, with approximately 0.55 probability it will rise. Considering potential for earnings disappointment, I give a 0.45 probability that the stock falls.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models in China.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple maintains a strong premium segment presence.  The news highlights both positives and negatives, with the negative being more directly related to the headline and thus more impactful to immediate market reaction.  While long-term prospects remain strong given Apple's overall brand strength and expansion in other areas, the short-term impact of the China market share decline is likely to outweigh the positives for investors immediately following the news release.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) strong financial performance, particularly in the AI sector, and its positive outlook, including a raised dividend and a bullish price target from Citi. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the new powerhouses contributing to Broadcom's growth, the article does not provide specific information about Apple's financials or its direct impact from this news. Therefore, the news is more directly relevant to Broadcom than to Apple. Given the lack of direct implications for Apple's stock, the probability of a significant movement in Apple's stock price based on this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China has declined in 2024, with domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. Although Apple grew in non-core markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific, the decline in a significant market like China is concerning. The overall smartphone market saw growth, but Apple's market share decreased from 19% in 2023 to 18% in 2024. While some analysts expect continued growth in Apple's revenue, the negative market share trend in a crucial region may outweigh positive expectations, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports a decline in Apple's iPhone market share in China, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. However, it also mentions that Apple continued to grow in non-core markets and that the company's premium offerings are helping to offset some of the declines. Additionally, the article notes that the global smartphone market is recovering, with sales growing 4% in 2024. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the decline in market share in a key region like China may have a negative impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a decline in iPhone market share in China due to strong competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Xiaomi, coupled with the introduction of AI features by competitors. Despite this, Apple continued to perform well in non-core markets. Overall, the news represents a mixed sentiment; while it highlights challenges in a key market, it also shows resilient global performance and growth potential in emerging markets.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
