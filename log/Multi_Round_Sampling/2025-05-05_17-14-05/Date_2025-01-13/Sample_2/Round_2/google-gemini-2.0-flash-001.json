A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline suggests a positive sentiment regarding earnings season, which investors hope will boost stock performance. However, the mention of the Fed's interest rate policies introduces uncertainty. If earnings reports are favorable, AAPL could see a price increase, but if expectations aren't met or if the market reacts negatively to the Fed's stance, AAPL could decline. Given Apple's strong position and past performance, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise relative to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's AI boom and impressive financial results, driven by strong demand from companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, and importantly, Apple. Broadcom exceeding expectations generally has a positive, albeit indirect, implication for Apple as it suggests robust demand in the sectors where Apple participates. The news highlights a positive outlook on Broadcom and Citi's Buy rating and $220 price target reinforces the growth narrative, However, Broadcom's success will not automatically transfer to a huge spike for Apple's stock price, though, it does imply some demand for Apple's product. U.S. export restrictions on AI chips to China might have some ripple effects on companies related to them. All taken together, the rise in the stock is slightly more likely, but only marginally so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights the importance of upcoming earnings season for maintaining the market's positive momentum, given the Fed's less-dovish stance on interest rate cuts.  Apple (AAPL) is a major component of the market, and its performance during earnings season will significantly influence market sentiment.  A strong earnings report from Apple is likely to boost investor confidence and push the stock price higher. However, a disappointing report could contribute to a broader market downturn and negatively impact AAPL.  The news itself is neutral, emphasizing the importance of earnings, not providing specific information about Apple's expected performance. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on general market dynamics and the inherent volatility of tech stocks like AAPL.  A slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise due to Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for a positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Warren Buffett's long-term commitment to owning certain stocks, which likely includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) given his well-known investment in the company. Buffett's endorsement is generally viewed as a strong positive signal due to his reputation as a value investor. This could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares, potentially driving the stock price higher. However, the headline does not provide specific new information or financial data, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. The probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so due to the lack of concrete news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that the current stock rally is faltering, and investors are hoping that the upcoming earnings season will revive it. Apple's stock price is likely to be impacted by the overall market sentiment and the performance of its peers during earnings season. If Apple's earnings report is strong, it may help revive the stock rally, but if it's weak, it could further dampen investor sentiment. Given that the news doesn't specifically mention Apple or its prospects, the impact is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. However, since the market is hoping for a revival of the stock rally through earnings season, there's a slightly higher chance of a positive surprise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, with Samsung taking the lead. Although Apple's market share has only declined by 1% and the company is experiencing growth in certain regions such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the overall sentiment of the article is negative. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and the need for Apple to provide discounts in China to remain competitive are also negative factors. However, the rise in demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants in China and the overall improvement in global consumer sentiment are positive factors. Considering these points, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has slipped to the second place in the worldwide smartphone market, with a decrease in market share from 19% to 18%. This is likely due to strong performance by Samsung, particularly in Europe and the US. While Apple still sees growth in certain regions like China, the overall shift could impact investor confidence negatively. However, the global improvement in consumer sentiment and a rebound in smartphone sales also suggest positive underlying trends. The measures taken by Apple, including offering discounts in China, indicate their strategies to remain competitive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights the critical role of corporate earnings in sustaining market momentum amidst tighter monetary policies from the Fed. While there is an overarching positive sentiment associated with the upcoming earnings season, which could boost Apple's stock if results exceed expectations, there is also caution due to the Fed's stance on interest rates creating potential volatility. Predictions from prior rounds show a varied outlook, with more favorable probabilities leaning towards a rise in stock price than a fall. Taking into account the general market dynamics, Apple's potential for strong performance amidst evolving economic conditions, and the balanced sentiment around earnings, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise, though moderated by the market uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's success, with significant contributions from Apple, indicating a strong partnership and positive outlook for both companies. While it's indirect, Broadcom's AI boom driven partly by Apple's demand, coupled with Citi's bullish outlook on Broadcom, implies positive sentiment for Apple as well. The fact that major AI players are investing heavily in Broadcom, and Broadcom is projecting strong growth, further strengthens the positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher, although the effect is indirect, since the actual news is about another company. The previous round predictions were mixed, which adds noise to this prediction. However, given the indirect but positive implication for Apple based on Broadcom's AI revenue and Apple's contribution to it, I assign a higher probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news piece highlights the crucial role of earnings season in influencing the market's direction, especially given the Fed's less-hawkish-than-expected approach to interest rate cuts.  This creates a scenario where Apple's performance during earnings season will be highly influential.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, from strong belief in a rise to a slight expectation of a fall.  Several models correctly point out that this news is quite neutral, not offering specific insights into Apple's performance. The range of previous predictions reflects this uncertainty.  Considering the existing uncertainty and the general market volatility, I am assigning probabilities that lean slightly towards a price increase, acknowledging Apple's historically strong performance, but also recognizing the potential for a negative surprise.  I've also considered the inherent risk in the tech sector and the dependence on a successful earnings season to maintain the current market rally.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's long-term commitment to owning certain stocks, which likely includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) given his well-known investment in the company. Buffett's endorsement is generally viewed as a strong positive signal due to his reputation as a value investor. This could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares, potentially driving the stock price higher. However, the headline does not provide specific new information or financial data, so the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, most models leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.65. The average sentiment suggests a slightly higher likelihood of a price rise. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so due to the lack of concrete news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors are hoping for the earnings season to revive the faltering stock rally, with corporate earnings growth becoming critical due to the Fed's interest rate policies. Apple's stock performance is likely to be influenced by its earnings report and overall market sentiment. Given Apple's strong position and past performance, there's a slightly higher likelihood of a positive surprise from a strong earnings report. However, the general market uncertainty and the importance of earnings season for tech stocks like AAPL suggest that both outcomes are possible. Considering the previous predictions and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has fallen to second place in the global smartphone market, with Samsung taking the lead. Although Apple's market share has only declined by 1% and the company is experiencing growth in certain regions, the overall sentiment of the article is negative. The mixed reviews of the iPhone 16 series and the need for Apple to provide discounts in China to remain competitive are also negative factors. However, the rise in demand for the Pro and Pro Max variants in China and the overall improvement in global consumer sentiment are positive factors. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a trend of assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling due to the negative sentiment around Apple's performance. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has slipped to the second place in the worldwide smartphone market, with a decrease in market share from 19% to 18%.
