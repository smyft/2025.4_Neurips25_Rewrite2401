Apple's market share decreased from 19% to 18%, while Samsung maintained a 19% share. Although Apple is experiencing growth in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the iPhone 16 series has seen rising demand in China, the overall news sentiment appears negative due to Apple's loss of the top spot and mixed reviews for the iPhone 16 series. Additionally, Apple is offering discounts in China to remain competitive, which could imply pressure on its pricing power and margins.
