(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\nNews Content: Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint\n\nSmartphone giantApple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country\u2019s domestic players in 2024.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.\n\nGlobal smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Among Goldman Highlights For AI Opportunities\n\nAlmost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.\n\nThe iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.\n\nHowever, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenue.\n\nCounterpoint\u2019s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple\u2019s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.\n\nXiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.\n\nXiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.\n\nOppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.\n\nThe top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei\u00a0has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.\n\nChina targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like\u00a0Huawei and\u00a0Xiaomi.\n\nWhile generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.\n\nIn 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI Leadership Shines While ON Semiconductor Faces Demand Slump: Analyst\n\nPhoto courtesy: Apple\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline mentions Warren Buffett, a highly respected and influential investor. His endorsement of certain stocks generally triggers positive sentiment in the market. However, the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks Buffett would own forever, which adds uncertainty. Without direct endorsement, there is still a chance it could lead to a positive outlook due to association but it is less compelling than explicit support. The overall market sentiment might lean towards a slight increase in probability of a price rise given Buffett's influence, but a decrease in price is also possible due to the lack of specific endorsement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is a stock Warren Buffett would 'own practically forever.' This implies strong long-term fundamentals and investor confidence. While Buffett's specific ownership might be publicly documented, the sentiment and implication of long-term value creation are positive for the stock. However, the impact is somewhat limited as this is not a new endorsement but rather a reiteration of Buffett's general investment philosophy applied to companies perceived to possess lasting competitive advantages. Because it is a general statement and not specific news, the impact on daily trading will likely be small.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's iPhone market share decline in China, a significant market, is a negative factor.  However, this is partially offset by growth in other regions and a shift towards higher-margin Pro models in China.  The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, and Apple maintains a strong premium segment presence.  The news highlights both positives and negatives, suggesting a mixed impact on the stock price.  While the loss of market share is concerning, the continued growth in other regions and the focus on premium products mitigate some of the negative impact. The predicted revenue growth for 2025 further suggests that the impact on the stock price may be less severe than a simple market share decrease might imply. The probability of a price rise is weighted lower due to the direct market share loss, but the other factors prevent a significantly higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the importance of corporate earnings growth in sustaining the market rally, especially given the Fed's slower-than-expected interest rate cuts. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), a strong earnings season could positively impact investor sentiment and stock price. However, the headline also suggests concerns about the broader market 'faltering,' which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the likelihood of a positive reaction to earnings is higher, but not without some risk of downside if earnings disappoint.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China has declined in 2024, with Huawei and Xiaomi gaining momentum. This decline in market share, particularly in a significant market like China, could negatively impact Apple's revenue and investor sentiment. However, it's worth noting that Apple continues to grow in non-core markets and that the iPhone's premium offerings are still in demand. Despite the negative impact, the overall smartphone market is showing signs of recovery, which could mitigate some of the decline. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising, but not drastically so, as the market may have already priced in some of this information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's strong fiscal 2024 results, with a 44% revenue increase and a 220% jump in AI revenue. The company also announced an 11% quarterly dividend hike and forecasts a 22% revenue jump in Q1 FY25. While the article does mention potential risks tied to Bytedance, a key customer, it notes that AI-heavyweights like Google, Meta, and Apple are set to drive significant growth for Broadcom. Given this positive news, it is likely that the stock price of Apple, which is mentioned as one of the drivers of Broadcom's growth, will also rise due to its association with the AI boom. However, the article does not provide direct information about Apple's financial performance, so the probability of the stock price rising is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a decline in iPhone market share in China due to strong competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Xiaomi, coupled with the introduction of AI features by competitors. Despite this, Apple continued to perform well in non-core markets. Overall, the news represents a mixed sentiment; while it highlights challenges in a key market, it also shows resilient global performance and growth potential in emerging markets.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline associates Apple with Warren Buffett, which generally triggers positive sentiment due to his reputation as a long-term investor. However, the lack of specific endorsement of Apple makes the impact less compelling. Previous predictions reflect mixed sentiment, especially with concerns about Apple's market share in China, which weighs against the positivity of Buffett's association. Despite this, Apple's fundamentals remain strong, and the overall market sentiment remains cautious but slightly optimistic. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability for a price rise than a fall, but both probabilities remain closely balanced due to the mixed indicators.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The headline focuses on Warren Buffett's long-term investment philosophy. While it doesn't explicitly state Apple *is* one of his forever stocks (it is an indirect endorsement based on Buffett's known holdings), the association with Buffett's strategy typically lends positive sentiment. The previous predictions were mixed, some emphasizing the positive association, others highlighting the indirect nature of the endorsement, and some even referring to news other than provided, especially iPhone market share in China. The sentiment seems to fall between cautious optimism and neutrality. I'll lean towards a slightly positive outlook, as Buffett's general investment style is well-regarded, but not as strongly positive as if the headline explicitly named AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A decline in Chinese market share is a significant negative, especially considering China's size. This is compounded by the success of competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi who are leveraging government subsidies and incorporating AI features.  However, the news also highlights continued growth in other regions, a shift towards higher-margin Pro models offsetting some of the China losses, and strong overall industry growth.  Furthermore, the projected 8% revenue growth in 2025 suggests resilience.  While the negative impact from the China market share loss is substantial, the positive factors prevent a prediction of a drastic price fall. The previous predictions show a range of sentiment; however, overall there is a slight consensus towards a greater probability of price fall than rise.  Considering all this, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a rise, but recognizing that the overall impact may be less severe than initially perceived.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline emphasizes the importance of corporate earnings growth in sustaining the market rally, especially given the Fed's slower-than-expected interest rate cuts. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), a strong earnings season could positively impact investor sentiment and stock price. However, the headline also suggests concerns about the broader market 'faltering,' which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong brand and historical performance, the likelihood of a positive reaction to earnings is higher, but not without some risk of downside if earnings disappoint. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise due to earnings potential and others highlighting risks like market share decline in China. Balancing these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's iPhone market share in China declined in 2024, while Huawei and Xiaomi gained momentum. However, Apple continued to grow in non-core markets, and there is a shift towards higher-margin Pro models in China. The overall global smartphone market growth is positive, but the decline in market share in a significant market like China is a negative factor. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Broadcom's strong fiscal 2024 results and its growth potential in the AI sector, with Apple mentioned as one of the drivers of this growth. The positive sentiment surrounding Broadcom's performance and its association with Apple's participation in the AI boom suggests a potential positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide direct information about Apple's financial performance, and the impact of Broadcom's success on Apple's stock is indirect. Considering the overall positive tone and the potential for growth in the AI sector, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling, but not excessively high due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a decline in iPhone market share in China due to strong competition from domestic players such as Huawei and Xiaomi, coupled with the introduction of AI features by competitors. Despite this challenging market situation, Apple maintains growth in non-core markets and has a strong presence in the premium segment. While the decline in China is a significant concern, it is partly offset by growth in other regions and the resilience shown in premium segments. The overall market for smartphones has shown signs of recovery, which may help mitigate some of the negative impact. Given these factors, the probability of stock price change remains balanced, leaning slightly towards a fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
