A whopping $19.4 billion, positioning Broadcom to keep rewarding investors while powering ahead.\n\nLooking forward, Broadcom is brimming with confidence, forecasting a 22% revenue jump in Q1 FY25 to $14.6 billion.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Broadcom's strong financial performance and bullish outlook, especially its significant revenue growth driven by AI, outlines a positive sentiment in the semiconductor sector, which may indirectly benefit Apple given its partnership and use of Broadcom's products. Furthermore, the increase in dividends indicates investor confidence in Broadcom, which could contribute to a favorable market environment for tech stocks, including Apple. While Broadcom's news primarily focuses on its own performance, the optimism in the sector could spill over to Apple. However, a degree of caution is warranted as external factors, like geopolitical risks and market conditions, could still affect performance. Thus, probabilities reflect a more favorable than unfavorable outlook for AAPL in light of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's impressive AI-driven growth and positive financial results. Apple is mentioned as a source of increasing demand for Broadcom's ASICs, implying a positive relationship and potential benefit for Apple. While Apple may not directly benefit from Broadcom's dividend increase or specific revenue figures, the overall positive sentiment regarding AI and Broadcom's performance likely creates a modestly bullish outlook for other related tech companies like Apple. However, this is indirect, and the direct impact on Apple's stock might be limited. Therefore, the probability of a rise isn't excessively high. There is always a chance of a fall due to unrelated market conditions or company-specific events.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights the importance of upcoming earnings season for maintaining the market's positive momentum, given the Fed's less-dovish stance on interest rate cuts.  Apple (AAPL) is a major component of the market, and its performance during earnings season will significantly influence market sentiment.  A strong earnings report from Apple is likely to boost investor confidence and push the stock price higher. However, a disappointing report could contribute to a broader market downturn and negatively impact AAPL.  The news itself is neutral - it doesn't contain any specific information about Apple's prospects.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on general market sentiment and the weight of Apple in the overall market. The probabilities are not strongly weighted towards either a rise or fall, as the news only highlights the overall market dependence on earnings season, rather than providing specific information on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that investors are looking to earnings season to revive a faltering stock rally, especially since the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates as quickly as hoped. This implies that corporate earnings growth is now a critical factor for market performance. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), a strong earnings report could positively impact the stock price, while weak earnings could lead to a decline. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a moderate probability of positive earnings, but uncertainty remains due to broader market conditions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Broadcom's (AVGO) strong financial performance and its positive outlook due to the growing demand for AI-related products. While the article mentions Apple (AAPL) as a key customer for Broadcom's ASIC sales, the primary focus is on Broadcom's achievements and future prospects. The news does not directly provide information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. However, as a major player in the tech industry and a potential beneficiary of Broadcom's AI advancements, Apple's stock might see a minor indirect positive effect. But given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's core business or recent performance, the impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news as slightly higher than falling, but with a cautious approach due to the indirect connection.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's strong financial performance, driven by its AI business, and its optimistic outlook for the future. While the article does not directly discuss Apple's financials, it mentions Apple as one of the companies driving demand for Broadcom's products. Given Broadcom's success and its relationship with Apple, it is likely that Apple's stock will also be positively affected. The article's tone is overwhelmingly positive, citing Broadcom's revenue growth, dividend increase, and strong free cash flow. This suggests that the market will react favorably to the news, which could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price as well.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news mentions Warren Buffett's views on a list of stocks he would hold indefinitely, but it does not specify whether Apple Inc. is included in his list. Warren Buffett is known as a successful investor with a long-term perspective, which can positively influence investors. However, the headline alone does not directly relate to Apple's performance or future prospects. This could cause speculation and short-term volatility, but without specific positive news about Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal. Investors' reactions may vary based on additional research.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news surrounding Broadcom's strong financial performance and optimistic outlook, particularly in the AI sector, suggests a positive sentiment in the technology market. Apple is mentioned as a key customer of Broadcom, indicating that the positive performance of Broadcom could have indirect benefits for Apple as well. While there are several previous predictions with varying probabilities, the general consensus leans toward a mildly bullish outlook for Apple based on the favorable news regarding Broadcom. However, since the news does not directly impact Apple's financials, and considering potential market volatility, the probabilities reflect a cautiously optimistic view.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news focuses on Broadcom's exceptional performance driven by AI, with specific mention of Apple as a customer contributing to the demand for Broadcom's ASICs. While the article primarily highlights Broadcom's success, the connection to Apple suggests a potential positive impact on Apple's stock. Broadcom's booming AI revenue (a staggering 220% jump) and overall revenue growth signal a strong market environment for related tech companies. However, the effect on Apple is indirect, as the news is mainly about Broadcom. Considering the previous predictions, most models leaned towards a slightly positive impact on Apple due to the indirect association with Broadcom's success, but also acknowledging that Apple's performance is influenced by many other factors. To strike a balance between the indirect positive sentiment and other market influences, I will adjust upwards from the previous average to reflect the continued positive association with a booming sector (AI).\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the importance of upcoming earnings season for the overall market, given the Fed's less-dovish stance on interest rate cuts.  This makes Apple's earnings report a crucial factor, as it's a major market component. A strong report would likely boost the stock, while a weak one could negatively impact the stock and broader markets.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term movement.  Several models lean towards a higher probability of a price rise, citing indirect positive factors like Broadcom's performance (though the connection is tenuous). However, the overall market dependence on earnings season introduces a considerable element of risk.  Considering the general uncertainty and the weighting of the earnings season, I am assigning probabilities that reflect a slightly higher chance of a rise, acknowledging the substantial uncertainty inherent in the situation. The absence of Apple-specific news increases the influence of market-wide sentiment on the stock's movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on the broader market's reliance on corporate earnings growth to sustain the stock rally, given the Fed's slower-than-expected interest rate cuts. While the news does not provide specific insights into Apple Inc.'s earnings or performance, Apple is a major player in the tech sector and its earnings report could significantly influence market sentiment. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a moderate probability of positive earnings, which could lead to a stock price rise. However, the uncertainty around broader market conditions and potential earnings disappointment could also lead to a stock price fall. Based on the general market sentiment and Apple's prominence, the probabilities are slightly tilted towards a rise, but with significant caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Broadcom's strong financial performance and its positive outlook driven by AI-related growth. Apple is mentioned as a key customer for Broadcom's ASIC sales, indicating a potential indirect benefit for Apple due to its relationship with Broadcom. However, the news does not provide direct information about Apple's financials or future prospects. Given the positive sentiment in the semiconductor sector and Apple's role as a major tech player, there could be a modestly bullish outlook for Apple. The probabilities reflect a slightly favorable outlook due to the indirect connection and overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article discusses Broadcom's strong financial performance and its positive outlook due to the growing demand for AI-related products. While the article mentions Apple as a key customer for Broadcom's ASIC sales, the primary focus is on Broadcom's achievements and future prospects. However, as a major player in the tech industry and a potential beneficiary of Broadcom's AI advancements, Apple's stock might see a minor indirect positive effect. The overall positive sentiment in the semiconductor sector, led by Broadcom's significant revenue growth driven by AI, could indirectly benefit Apple. Considering the previous predictions, which also took into account the indirect relationship between Apple and Broadcom, the estimated probability of the stock price rising seems to be higher than that of falling, though not excessively high due to the indirect nature of the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline about Warren Buffett's perspective on holding certain stocks forever does not provide specific information regarding Apple Inc. directly. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments influenced by various market and company-specific factors. The majority of previous predictions suggest a moderate likelihood of Apple stock rising. However, the most recent prediction indicates skepticism due to lack of direct Apple-related news. Considering the neutral nature of the news and the mix of previous predictions, a cautious probability is warranted.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
