      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook suggests that investor sentiment is likely to decline. The revised price target implies a 13% downside, which further indicates that analysts expect a decrease in the stock price going forward. Given these negative indicators, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway still holds a large stake, they have significantly reduced their position, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth (excluding buy backs), which are negative factors. However, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive. The 'not a buy' recommendation in the article title and overall tone further suggests downward pressure. While Buffett's continued holding provides some support, the stated reasons for selling more than half of his stake leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decrease in the near term, especially with a potential market downturn looming in the author's opinion. Note that there is an advertisement for 'Double Down' stocks within the article, which may bias the reader into feeling like Apple is a poor buy, which is also considered in this probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its large portfolio weighting.  He also predicts Apple will miss its quarterly earnings and anticipates further downgrades before an eventual upgrade. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential,  this news is predominantly negative in the short term due to the announced sale and pessimistic earnings forecast.  The fact that he mentions other, presumably AI related, stocks as being more promising further strengthens the bearish sentiment. However,  Cramer's opinions are subjective and not always accurate predictors of market movements. The market's reaction may be muted or even positive, particularly if other positive news emerges.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a price fall but acknowledges the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., amounting to $69.9 billion. Buffett's endorsement, particularly as a long-term value investor, often signals confidence in the company's stability and future prospects. Given his reputation and the substantial investment, this news is likely to generate positive sentiment among investors, potentially driving demand for the stock. However, the market's reaction may also depend on broader market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. Overall, the news is more likely to be perceived positively than negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's meeting and other market news on the stock price. With the S&P 500 having its best first four trading days under a new president since 1985, the market is showing positive momentum. Apple's earnings report is expected to be strong, given the company's history of beating expectations. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, may lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's high valuation rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook heavily influences the sentiment around Apple's stock. Analysts expect a miss in revenue growth guidance for the first fiscal quarter and only low single-digit growth in the second quarter, indicating negative investor sentiment. The new price target of $200.75 implies a notable downside of 13%. Given the consensus among multiple analysts, the heavy emphasis on missed targets and weak demand presents an overwhelming bearish outlook for Apple. Although some analysts have expressed mixed views or potential long-term optimism, the current focus on downgrade news predominantly weighs against a rise in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced view of Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. While Warren Buffett maintains a substantial investment, suggesting underlying confidence, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article points out Apple's slowing revenue growth and the reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share, which are concerns. However, the growing services revenue represents a positive factor. Others' predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the information within the article, and the fact that Buffett already greatly reduced his position in AAPL, I'm leaning towards the stock decreasing over the short term. Thus a probability of fall greater than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling Apple stock due to portfolio over-weighting, coupled with his prediction of a missed earnings quarter and potential further downgrades, presents a predominantly negative short-term outlook.  While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate impact of his comments and the anticipated negative earnings report likely outweigh any positive sentiment. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price decrease.  However, the fact that Cramer's opinion is subjective and not a guaranteed indicator of market movement needs to be considered.  Although the news is predominantly bearish in the short term, the possibility of a muted market reaction or even a positive one due to other unforeseen factors cannot be entirely discounted.  Therefore, the probability is weighted towards a fall, but a significant probability of a rise is still possible, particularly if the earnings report surprises positively or other market factors create a supportive environment for tech stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is a strong positive signal given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also mentions that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces a note of caution. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and high valuation, while others are more optimistic due to Buffett's continued confidence and Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may weigh Buffett's reduced stake against his overall large investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mix of positive and negative factors that could influence Apple's stock price. On the positive side, the overall market sentiment is strong, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing gains. Additionally, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive factors. However, the company's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth, as well as Warren Buffett's reduction of his stake, are negative indicators. The upcoming earnings report and the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged could also impact the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's high valuation rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors. Considering previous predictions and the current market conditions, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook creates significant negative sentiment around Apple Inc. Analysts are projecting a miss on revenue growth guidance and suggest low single-digit revenue growth for future quarters, indicating a bearish outlook. The revised price target implies a notable downside, further consolidating the negative sentiment among investors. Although there are mixed views and some positive indicators from Buffett's investment, the prevailing negative commentary suggests a stronger probability of price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook. While Buffett's large holding initially suggests confidence, his significant stake reduction due to overvaluation is concerning. Apple's slowing revenue and free cash flow growth (excluding buybacks) are negative. The growing services revenue is a positive point, but not enough to offset the overvaluation concerns. The overall sentiment of the article is cautious, suggesting a potential stock price fall. Also, considering that others round predictions are trending more towards fall than rise, it further supports a bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing and his prediction of a disappointing earnings quarter. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, this short-term negative sentiment is significant.  Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight tendency toward a price fall.  However, the overall consensus isn't overwhelmingly bearish. Cramer's opinion, while influential, isn't always an accurate market predictor.  The market's reaction could be muted or even positive depending on the actual earnings report and broader market conditions.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I assign a higher probability to the price falling but acknowledge a non-trivial chance of a rise, primarily if earnings exceed expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is a strong positive signal given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also mentions that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces a note of caution. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and high valuation, while others are more optimistic due to Buffett's continued confidence and Apple's strong fundamentals.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market.

However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price. Additionally, considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the overall trend is slightly bullish.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc.

Analysts expect the company to miss revenue growth guidance, further reinforcing a bearish outlook. Despite some positive indicators, such as Warren Buffett's continued stake and the potential in Apple's services segment, the prevailing bearish commentary and downgrade's implications (13% downside) suggest a stronger likelihood of stock price decline in the short term. Thus, I estimate a high probability of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a somewhat bearish view on Apple's stock. While Buffett maintains a large position, his significant reduction in shares due to overvaluation is a major concern. Revenue and free cash flow growth are slowing, and the article explicitly states that it's 'Not time to buy'. Previous predictions show a trend toward a higher likelihood of the stock falling, particularly considering the negative sentiment from analysts. Despite strengths in Apple's service sector, the valuation concerns and the overall tone of the article suggest a greater chance of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, coupled with his prediction of a disappointing earnings quarter and potential further downgrades. This presents a predominantly negative short-term outlook, outweighing any positive sentiment stemming from Apple's long-term potential.  Previous predictions are mixed, but trend slightly towards a price fall. However, Cramer's opinion is subjective and not a guaranteed market indicator. The market's reaction could be muted or even positive depending on the actual earnings report and broader market conditions. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge a non-trivial probability of a rise. The consistent bearish trend in the previous prediction rounds, even after considering the counter-arguments presented, further strengthens the likelihood of a decrease in stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Warren Buffett's significant investment of $69.9 billion signals confidence in the company's long-term stability and growth potential, given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also notes that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces caution. Additionally, Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share are concerns. The growing services revenue is a positive factor, but the overall sentiment is cautious due to high valuation and slowing growth. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to these negative factors. Considering the balance between Buffett's ongoing confidence and the noted concerns about valuation and growth, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple Inc.

However, there are concerns about Apple's slowing revenue growth, relatively slow free cash flow growth, and the high valuation of its stock. The news also mentions that Buffett has reduced his stake in Apple, citing overvaluation relative to growth. Considering these mixed signals and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions with a slight tendency towards a price fall, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```"
