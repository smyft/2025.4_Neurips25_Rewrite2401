(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook suggests that investor sentiment is likely to decline. The revised price target implies a 13% downside, which further indicates that analysts expect a decrease in the stock price going forward. Given these negative indicators, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway still holds a large stake, they have significantly reduced their position, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth (excluding buy backs), which are negative factors. However, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive. The 'not a buy' recommendation in the article title and overall tone further suggests downward pressure. While Buffett's continued holding provides some support, the stated reasons for selling more than half of his stake leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decrease in the near term, especially with a potential market downturn looming in the author's opinion. Note that there is an advertisement for 'Double Down' stocks within the article, which may bias the reader into feeling like Apple is a poor buy, which is also considered in this probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its large portfolio weighting.  He also predicts Apple will miss its quarterly earnings and anticipates further downgrades before an eventual upgrade. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential,  this news is predominantly negative in the short term due to the announced sale and pessimistic earnings forecast.  The fact that he mentions other, presumably AI related, stocks as being more promising further strengthens the bearish sentiment. However,  Cramer's opinions are subjective and not always accurate predictors of market movements. The market's reaction may be muted or even positive, particularly if other positive news emerges.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a price fall but acknowledges the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., amounting to $69.9 billion. Buffett's endorsement, particularly as a long-term value investor, often signals confidence in the company's stability and future prospects. Given his reputation and the substantial investment, this news is likely to generate positive sentiment among investors, potentially driving demand for the stock. However, the market's reaction may also depend on broader market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. Overall, the news is more likely to be perceived positively than negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's meeting and other market news on the stock price. With the S&P 500 having its best first four trading days under a new president since 1985, the market is showing positive momentum. Apple's earnings report is expected to be strong, given the company's history of beating expectations. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, may lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's high valuation rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook heavily influences the sentiment around Apple's stock. Analysts expect a miss in revenue growth guidance for the first fiscal quarter and only low single-digit growth in the second quarter, indicating negative investor sentiment. The new price target of $200.75 implies a notable downside of 13%. Given the consensus among multiple analysts, the heavy emphasis on missed targets and weak demand presents an overwhelming bearish outlook for Apple. Although some analysts have expressed mixed views or potential long-term optimism, the current focus on downgrade news predominantly weighs against a rise in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced view of Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. While Warren Buffett maintains a substantial investment, suggesting underlying confidence, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article points out Apple's slowing revenue growth and the reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share, which are concerns. However, the growing services revenue represents a positive factor. Others' predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the information within the article, and the fact that Buffett already greatly reduced his position in AAPL, I'm leaning towards the stock decreasing over the short term. Thus a probability of fall greater than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling Apple stock due to portfolio over-weighting, coupled with his prediction of a missed earnings quarter and potential further downgrades, presents a predominantly negative short-term outlook.  While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate impact of his comments and the anticipated negative earnings report likely outweigh any positive sentiment. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price decrease.  However, the fact that Cramer's opinion is subjective and not a guaranteed indicator of market movement needs to be considered.  Although the news is predominantly bearish in the short term, the possibility of a muted market reaction or even a positive one due to other unforeseen factors cannot be entirely discounted.  Therefore, the probability is weighted towards a fall, but a significant probability of a rise is still possible, particularly if the earnings report surprises positively or other market factors create a supportive environment for tech stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is a strong positive signal given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also mentions that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces a note of caution. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and high valuation, while others are more optimistic due to Buffett's continued confidence and Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may weigh Buffett's reduced stake against his overall large investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mix of positive and negative factors that could influence Apple's stock price. On the positive side, the overall market sentiment is strong, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing gains. Additionally, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive factors. However, the company's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth, as well as Warren Buffett's reduction of his stake, are negative indicators. The upcoming earnings report and the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged could also impact the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's high valuation rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors. Considering previous predictions and the current market conditions, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook creates significant negative sentiment around Apple Inc. Analysts are projecting a miss on revenue growth guidance and suggest low single-digit revenue growth for future quarters, indicating a bearish outlook. The revised price target implies a notable downside, further consolidating the negative sentiment among investors. Although there are mixed views and some positive indicators from Buffett's investment, the prevailing negative commentary suggests a stronger probability of price falling than rising in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook. While Buffett's large holding initially suggests confidence, his significant stake reduction due to overvaluation is concerning. Apple's slowing revenue and free cash flow growth (excluding buybacks) are negative. The growing services revenue is a positive point, but not enough to offset the overvaluation concerns. The overall sentiment of the article is cautious, suggesting a potential stock price fall. Also, considering that others round predictions are trending more towards fall than rise, it further supports a bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing and his prediction of a disappointing earnings quarter. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, this short-term negative sentiment is significant.  Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight tendency toward a price fall.  However, the overall consensus isn't overwhelmingly bearish. Cramer's opinion, while influential, isn't always an accurate market predictor.  The market's reaction could be muted or even positive depending on the actual earnings report and broader market conditions.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I assign a higher probability to the price falling but acknowledge a non-trivial chance of a rise, primarily if earnings exceed expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is a strong positive signal given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also mentions that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces a note of caution. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and high valuation, while others are more optimistic due to Buffett's continued confidence and Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may weigh Buffett's reduced stake against his overall large investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price. Additionally, considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the overall trend is slightly bullish.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow.

While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors. Considering previous predictions and the current market conditions, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies citing weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook presents significant negative sentiment surrounding Apple Inc. Analysts expect the company to miss revenue growth guidance, further reinforcing a bearish outlook. Despite some positive indicators, such as Warren Buffett's continued stake and the potential in Apple's services segment, the prevailing bearish commentary and downgrade's implications (13% downside) suggest a stronger likelihood of stock price decline in the short term. Thus, I estimate a high probability of a price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a somewhat bearish view on Apple's stock. While Buffett maintains a large position, his significant reduction in shares due to overvaluation is a major concern. Revenue and free cash flow growth are slowing, and the article explicitly states that it's 'Not time to buy'. Previous predictions show a trend toward a higher likelihood of the stock falling, particularly considering the negative sentiment from analysts. Despite strengths in Apple's service sector, the valuation concerns and the overall tone of the article suggest a greater chance of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, coupled with his prediction of a disappointing earnings quarter and potential further downgrades. This presents a predominantly negative short-term outlook, outweighing any positive sentiment stemming from Apple's long-term potential.  Previous predictions are mixed, but trend slightly towards a price fall. However, Cramer's opinion is subjective and not a guaranteed market indicator. The market's reaction could be muted or even positive depending on the actual earnings report and broader market conditions. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge a non-trivial probability of a rise. The consistent bearish trend in the previous prediction rounds, even after considering the counter-arguments presented, further strengthens the likelihood of a decrease in stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Warren Buffett's significant investment of $69.9 billion signals confidence in the company's long-term stability and growth potential, given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also notes that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces caution. Additionally, Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share are concerns. The growing services revenue is a positive factor, but the overall sentiment is cautious due to high valuation and slowing growth. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to these negative factors. Considering the balance between Buffett's ongoing confidence and the noted concerns about valuation and growth, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of major tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The market is showing positive momentum, with the S&P 500 having its best first four trading days under a new president since 1985.
