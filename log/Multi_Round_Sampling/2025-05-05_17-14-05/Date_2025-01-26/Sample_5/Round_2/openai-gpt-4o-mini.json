(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook suggests that investor sentiment is likely to decline. The revised price target implies a 13% downside, which further indicates that analysts expect a decrease in the stock price going forward. Given these negative indicators, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway still holds a large stake, they have significantly reduced their position, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth (excluding buy backs), which are negative factors. However, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive. The 'not a buy' recommendation in the article title and overall tone further suggests downward pressure. While Buffett's continued holding provides some support, the stated reasons for selling more than half of his stake leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decrease in the near term, especially with a potential market downturn looming in the author's opinion. Note that there is an advertisement for 'Double Down' stocks within the article, which may bias the reader into feeling like Apple is a poor buy, which is also considered in this probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its large portfolio weighting.  He also predicts Apple will miss its quarterly earnings and anticipates further downgrades before an eventual upgrade. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential,  this news is predominantly negative in the short term due to the announced sale and pessimistic earnings forecast.  The fact that he mentions other, presumably AI related, stocks as being more promising further strengthens the bearish sentiment. However,  Cramer's opinions are subjective and not always accurate predictors of market movements. The market's reaction may be muted or even positive, particularly if other positive news emerges.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a price fall but acknowledges the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., amounting to $69.9 billion. Buffett's endorsement, particularly as a long-term value investor, often signals confidence in the company's stability and future prospects. Given his reputation and the substantial investment, this news is likely to generate positive sentiment among investors, potentially driving demand for the stock. However, the market's reaction may also depend on broader market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. Overall, the news is more likely to be perceived positively than negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the upcoming earnings report of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's meeting and other market news on the stock price. With the S&P 500 having its best first four trading days under a new president since 1985, the market is showing positive momentum. Apple's earnings report is expected to be strong, given the company's history of beating expectations. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, may lead to a higher probability of a stock price fall if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's high valuation rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook heavily influences the sentiment around Apple's stock. Analysts expect a miss in revenue growth guidance for the first fiscal quarter and only low single-digit growth in the second quarter, indicating negative investor sentiment. The new price target of $200.75 implies a notable downside of 13%. Given the consensus among multiple analysts, the heavy emphasis on missed targets and weak demand presents an overwhelming bearish outlook for Apple. Although some analysts have expressed mixed views or potential long-term optimism, the current focus on downgrade news predominantly weighs against a rise in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced view of Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. While Warren Buffett maintains a substantial investment, suggesting underlying confidence, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article points out Apple's slowing revenue growth and the reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share, which are concerns. However, the growing services revenue represents a positive factor. Others' predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the information within the article, and the fact that Buffett already greatly reduced his position in AAPL, I'm leaning towards the stock decreasing over the short term. Thus a probability of fall greater than rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling Apple stock due to portfolio over-weighting, coupled with his prediction of a missed earnings quarter and potential further downgrades, presents a predominantly negative short-term outlook.  While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate impact of his comments and the anticipated negative earnings report likely outweigh any positive sentiment. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price decrease.  However, the fact that Cramer's opinion is subjective and not a guaranteed indicator of market movement needs to be considered.  Although the news is predominantly bearish in the short term, the possibility of a muted market reaction or even a positive one due to other unforeseen factors cannot be entirely discounted.  Therefore, the probability is weighted towards a fall, but a significant probability of a rise is still possible, particularly if the earnings report surprises positively or other market factors create a supportive environment for tech stocks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which is a strong positive signal given his reputation as a value investor. However, the article also mentions that Buffett has reduced his stake, citing overvaluation relative to growth, which introduces a note of caution. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and high valuation, while others are more optimistic due to Buffett's continued confidence and Apple's strong fundamentals. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not overwhelmingly so, as the market may weigh Buffett's reduced stake against his overall large investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mix of positive and negative factors that could influence Apple's stock price. On the positive side, the overall market sentiment is strong, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing gains. Additionally, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive factors. However, the company's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth, as well as Warren Buffett's reduction of his stake, are negative indicators. The upcoming earnings report and the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged could also impact the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the market's high expectations for Big Tech and the potential clash between Trump and the Fed may also impact the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's high valuation rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the overall picture suggests cautious optimism for investors. Considering previous predictions and the current market conditions, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative sentiments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
