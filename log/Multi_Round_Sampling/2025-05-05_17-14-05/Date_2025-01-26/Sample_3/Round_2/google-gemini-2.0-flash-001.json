(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant but declining investment in Apple, shedding light on his reduced confidence as the company faces stagnant growth in sales and profits. Although Apple's large free cash flow and potential for increasing service revenues are positive aspects, the stretched valuation and recent history of sell-offs may lead investors to be cautious. The overall sentiment leans toward skepticism regarding immediate investment opportunities in Apple, creating a higher likelihood for a price decline amidst market corrections and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a negative outlook for Apple in the short term. Jim Cramer's firm sold some Apple stock due to portfolio imbalance, and he anticipates a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment is bearish, particularly given his anticipation of a disappointing quarter result. His statements regarding China smartphone sales being a narrow view and his dismissal of Zuckerberg's innovation claims are less impactful compared to the potential of a missed quarter. Cramer expressing conviction in some AI stocks over AAPL increases the bearish sentiment. I assign a higher probability to the stock price falling due to the anticipation of an earnings miss.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a shift among some companies to scale back these programs.  Apple's steadfast stance, similar to that of Costco and some major banks, suggests resilience against potential negative impacts from the current political climate. While the article mentions potential legal challenges facing some companies regarding their DEI programs,  there's no direct indication of immediate repercussions for Apple.  The upcoming shareholder vote on Apple's DEI programs presents some uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a low probability of a significant negative market reaction.  The probability of a stock price rise is low, as this news is primarily defensive and doesn't suggest any positive catalysts for growth.  The lack of explicitly negative implications, however, makes the probability of a price fall also relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio share and predicts a potential earnings miss. This could lead to temporary negative sentiment among investors. However, AAPL remains a strong company with long-term growth potential, as acknowledged by Cramer himself. The immediate market reaction is likely skewed negative due to the earnings miss prediction and potential downgrades, but the long-term outlook remains neutral to positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Warren Buffett is a highly respected investor, his investment moves are often seen as a vote of confidence in a company. However, the article does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the stock in question, which is crucial for directly attributing the news to AAPL's stock price movement. Historically, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held a significant stake in Apple, which could imply that the stock in question might be Apple. If investors perceive this as a positive endorsement, it could lead to increased confidence in AAPL, potentially driving the stock price up. On the other hand, if the stock in question is not AAPL, or if investors are skeptical about the reasons behind the investment, the stock price might not react positively. Given these considerations, there is a potential for the stock price to rise due to the positive perception of Buffett's investment strategy, but there's also a risk that the impact might be neutral or negative if the connection to AAPL is not clear or if other factors outweigh this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is not due to concerns about Apple's business, but rather its stretched valuation. Despite this, the article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. Additionally, Apple's growing services segment and high-margin sales provide a potential catalyst for long-term earnings growth. However, the current valuation of the stock and near-stagnant sales and profits make it a less attractive buy at present. Considering these factors, I estimate a low to moderate probability of the stock price rising and a moderate to high probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple and his recent decision to reduce his stake, which could indicate reduced confidence in Apple's current valuation and growth prospects. While Buffett's investment typically indicates strength, the ongoing earnings deceleration and skepticism about Apple's stretched valuation could lead to negative sentiment among investors. The market's reaction could be influenced by concerns over stagnating sales and the potential for an earnings miss, particularly if analysts foresee downgrades. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability for the stock price to fall rather than rise, reflecting caution among investors based on the current market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell part of his firm's Apple holdings because it became overweight in their portfolio. He also predicts a potential earnings miss for the company. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, these short-term concerns and negative predictions outweigh any potential positive sentiment. The previous round predictions were quite varied, but the models leaning towards a negative outlook seem more aligned with the core information presented. Given Cramer's influence and the negative sentiment around potential earnings miss, there is a greater chance of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, contrasting with other companies scaling back.  While this stance might appeal to some investors, the article also highlights growing political and legal pressure against DEI programs, creating potential risks.  The upcoming shareholder vote adds uncertainty.  Previous predictions are varied, reflecting a lack of clear directional signal from the news. The news itself is largely neutral for Apple's stock price; any impact will likely be relatively minor and depend on the market's overall reaction to the ongoing DEI debate.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent volatility of the stock market, I assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively unchanged than significantly rising or falling.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Jim Cramer's firm sold some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to its large portfolio share and anticipates a potential earnings miss, which could lead to analyst downgrades. This creates a short-term negative sentiment. However, Cramer also acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, which may mitigate some of the immediate bearishness. Given the mixed signals\u2014short-term caution versus long-term optimism\u2014the immediate market reaction is likely skewed negative. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the short-term concerns raised by Cramer's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Warren Buffett has a significant investment in a dividend-paying stock, which could imply Apple Inc. given his historical stake in the company. However, the news does not explicitly mention Apple, creating some uncertainty. Historically, Buffett's investments are seen as a vote of confidence, which could positively impact Apple's stock price if investors make the connection. On the other hand, recent sentiments from other analysts like Jim Cramer have been bearish, citing potential earnings misses and valuation concerns. Considering these mixed signals, there is a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price rising due to Buffett's implied endorsement, but the overall market sentiment appears cautious.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is not due to concerns about Apple's business, but rather its stretched valuation. Despite this, the article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. Additionally, Apple's growing services segment and high-margin sales provide a potential catalyst for long-term earnings growth. However, the current valuation of the stock and near-stagnant sales and profits make it a less attractive buy at present. Considering these factors and the predictions from other models, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling due to the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to DEI programs, which stands in contrast to the broader trend of companies pulling back on such efforts. This could be viewed positively by socially-conscious investors who value a company's commitment to diversity, potentially bolstering public perception and demand for the stock. However, the article also notes increasing political and regulatory pressure against DEI programs, which introduces uncertainties. Given the mixed sentiment, along with the previously strong market predictions leaning towards a negative outlook, it is plausible that the positive aspects of Apple's commitment to DEI may not override the existing bearish sentiments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
