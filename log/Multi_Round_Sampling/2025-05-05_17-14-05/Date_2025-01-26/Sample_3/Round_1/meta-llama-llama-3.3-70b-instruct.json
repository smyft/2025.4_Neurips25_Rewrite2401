(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?\nNews Content: There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Is It a Buy Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant but declining investment in Apple, shedding light on his reduced confidence as the company faces stagnant growth in sales and profits. Although Apple's large free cash flow and potential for increasing service revenues are positive aspects, the stretched valuation and recent history of sell-offs may lead investors to be cautious. The overall sentiment leans toward skepticism regarding immediate investment opportunities in Apple, creating a higher likelihood for a price decline amidst market corrections and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a negative outlook for Apple in the short term. Jim Cramer's firm sold some Apple stock due to portfolio imbalance, and he anticipates a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment is bearish, particularly given his anticipation of a disappointing quarter result. His statements regarding China smartphone sales being a narrow view and his dismissal of Zuckerberg's innovation claims are less impactful compared to the potential of a missed quarter. Cramer expressing conviction in some AI stocks over AAPL increases the bearish sentiment. I assign a higher probability to the stock price falling due to the anticipation of an earnings miss.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a shift among some companies to scale back these programs.  Apple's steadfast stance, similar to that of Costco and some major banks, suggests resilience against potential negative impacts from the current political climate. While the article mentions potential legal challenges facing some companies regarding their DEI programs,  there's no direct indication of immediate repercussions for Apple.  The upcoming shareholder vote on Apple's DEI programs presents some uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a low probability of a significant negative market reaction.  The probability of a stock price rise is low, as this news is primarily defensive and doesn't suggest any positive catalysts for growth.  The lack of explicitly negative implications, however, makes the probability of a price fall also relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio share and predicts a potential earnings miss. This could lead to temporary negative sentiment among investors. However, AAPL remains a strong company with long-term growth potential, as acknowledged by Cramer himself. The immediate market reaction is likely skewed negative due to the earnings miss prediction and potential downgrades, but the long-term outlook remains neutral to positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Warren Buffett is a highly respected investor, his investment moves are often seen as a vote of confidence in a company. However, the article does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the stock in question, which is crucial for directly attributing the news to AAPL's stock price movement. Historically, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held a significant stake in Apple, which could imply that the stock in question might be Apple. If investors perceive this as a positive endorsement, it could lead to increased confidence in AAPL, potentially driving the stock price up. On the other hand, if the stock in question is not AAPL, or if investors are skeptical about the reasons behind the investment, the stock price might not react positively. Given these considerations, there is a potential for the stock price to rise due to the positive perception of Buffett's investment strategy, but there's also a risk that the impact might be neutral or negative if the connection to AAPL is not clear or if other factors outweigh this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is not due to concerns about Apple's business, but rather its stretched valuation. Despite this, the article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. Additionally, Apple's growing services segment and high-margin sales provide a potential catalyst for long-term earnings growth. However, the current valuation of the stock and near-stagnant sales and profits make it a less attractive buy at present. Considering these factors, I estimate a low to moderate probability of the stock price rising and a moderate to high probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
