(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant but declining investment in Apple, shedding light on his reduced confidence as the company faces stagnant growth in sales and profits. Although Apple's large free cash flow and potential for increasing service revenues are positive aspects, the stretched valuation and recent history of sell-offs may lead investors to be cautious. The overall sentiment leans toward skepticism regarding immediate investment opportunities in Apple, creating a higher likelihood for a price decline amidst market corrections and valuation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest a negative outlook for Apple in the short term. Jim Cramer's firm sold some Apple stock due to portfolio imbalance, and he anticipates a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades. While he acknowledges Apple's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment is bearish, particularly given his anticipation of a disappointing quarter result. His statements regarding China smartphone sales being a narrow view and his dismissal of Zuckerberg's innovation claims are less impactful compared to the potential of a missed quarter. Cramer expressing conviction in some AI stocks over AAPL increases the bearish sentiment. I assign a higher probability to the stock price falling due to the anticipation of an earnings miss.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a shift among some companies to scale back these programs.  Apple's steadfast stance, similar to that of Costco and some major banks, suggests resilience against potential negative impacts from the current political climate. While the article mentions potential legal challenges facing some companies regarding their DEI programs,  there's no direct indication of immediate repercussions for Apple.  The upcoming shareholder vote on Apple's DEI programs presents some uncertainty, but the overall tone suggests a low probability of a significant negative market reaction.  The probability of a stock price rise is low, as this news is primarily defensive and doesn't suggest any positive catalysts for growth.  The lack of explicitly negative implications, however, makes the probability of a price fall also relatively low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some AAPL stock due to its large portfolio share and predicts a potential earnings miss. This could lead to temporary negative sentiment among investors. However, AAPL remains a strong company with long-term growth potential, as acknowledged by Cramer himself. The immediate market reaction is likely skewed negative due to the earnings miss prediction and potential downgrades, but the long-term outlook remains neutral to positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has $69.9 billion invested in a dividend-paying stock, and the implication is that this stock could be a good buy now. Given that Warren Buffett is a highly respected investor, his investment moves are often seen as a vote of confidence in a company. However, the article does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the stock in question, which is crucial for directly attributing the news to AAPL's stock price movement. Historically, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held a significant stake in Apple, which could imply that the stock in question might be Apple. If investors perceive this as a positive endorsement, it could lead to increased confidence in AAPL, potentially driving the stock price up. On the other hand, if the stock in question is not AAPL, or if investors are skeptical about the reasons behind the investment, the stock price might not react positively. Given these considerations, there is a potential for the stock price to rise due to the positive perception of Buffett's investment strategy, but there's also a risk that the impact might be neutral or negative if the connection to AAPL is not clear or if other factors outweigh this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. and the recent reduction of Apple shares in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The reasoning behind the sale is not due to concerns about Apple's business, but rather its stretched valuation. Despite this, the article highlights Apple's ability to generate significant free cash flow, which can be used for dividend payments, reinvestment, or debt reduction. Additionally, Apple's growing services segment and high-margin sales provide a potential catalyst for long-term earnings growth. However, the current valuation of the stock and near-stagnant sales and profits make it a less attractive buy at present. Considering these factors, I estimate a low to moderate probability of the stock price rising and a moderate to high probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
