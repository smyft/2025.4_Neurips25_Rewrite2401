(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc., particularly stating that he sold some stock because it became too significant a part of his portfolio. He also predicts that the company will miss earnings expectations and anticipates downgrades from analysts. These statements may lead investors to perceive a bearish outlook on AAPL, contributing to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Given Cramer's influence, his cautious outlook is likely to sway market sentiment negatively, overshadowing any potential positives around AAPL's long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on analyst ratings changes. Apple received a downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and concerns about AI integration, projecting a 13% downside. This suggests a negative outlook. While market sentiment can be influenced by various factors, a downgrade by a reputable firm typically exerts downward pressure on the stock. Therefore, a higher probability is given to the stock price falling. No other positive information in the provided excerpt is influencing the stock price in a positive manner.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple stock holdings, citing Apple's high valuation relative to its recent earnings growth.  While Apple's service sector is expanding, overall revenue growth is slow.  The article concludes that the current valuation makes Apple a less attractive buy. This suggests a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's large free cash flow and dividend potential provide some support. The fact that Buffett still holds a substantial position indicates some continued confidence.  Therefore, while the news leans bearish, due to Buffett's actions and the valuation concerns, it's unlikely to cause an immediate or drastic price drop.  The probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price decrease due to the prominent negative factors highlighted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) A strong start to the earnings season for S&P 500 companies, with tech heavyweights like Apple reporting. The 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in Q4, which is significantly higher than the rest of the S&P 500. This suggests positive sentiment around Apple's earnings. 2) The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision is expected to keep rates unchanged, which generally supports tech stocks. 3) The AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple as part of the broader tech sector. 4) The overall market sentiment is positive, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying recently. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong earnings expectations and the positive tech sector momentum, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article mentions Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he states that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the stock will go lower due to potential disappointing quarter results. However, he also mentions that the stock has historically gone up thousands of percent after being downgraded. This mixed sentiment suggests that the stock price movement is uncertain, but the immediate negative comments may have a slightly higher impact on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple reflects a level of confidence, his significant reduction in holdings suggests concern over valuation and growth potential. Recent performance shows modest growth in revenue and free cash flow, but these are offset by concerns over valuation and decelerating earnings. Additionally, the company's service segment could provide stability, reducing the risk of a severe downturn. However, the current valuation makes the stock less attractive for new investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news includes Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL) missing earnings expectations and his decision to reduce stock holdings due to AAPL becoming too significant a portion of his portfolio. Cramer's remarks often influence market sentiment, suggesting a bearish outlook for investors. However, other analysts have also pointed out the company's strong sales prospects in segments beyond iPhones and overall market conditions that could support stocks like AAPL. Given the mixed sentiments and increased analyst cautions, I predict a higher likelihood of a stock price fall. The previous models indicate a bearish sentiment overall, with probabilities assigned primarily leaning towards a decline in stock price amidst the current cautious economic outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on negative analyst ratings for Apple (downgrade from Jefferies) due to weak iPhone sales, concerns about AI integration, and a reduced outlook for future iPhone iterations and revenue growth. Jefferies' price target implies a 13% downside. This outweighs any potential positives. Previous predictions also mostly leaned towards a price decrease. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's significant reduction of Apple stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. While Buffett still holds a substantial amount, the sale is attributed to Apple's high valuation relative to its recent earnings growth.  Apple's revenue growth is slow, although its service sector is expanding.  The article concludes that the stock's high valuation makes it less attractive. This bearish sentiment is supported by previous predictions that lean toward a price decrease. However, Apple's strong free cash flow and dividend potential offer some mitigating factors. The fact that Buffett maintains a significant stake suggests some ongoing confidence in the company's long-term prospects.  Considering these factors and the overall bearish tone of the article, along with the previous predictions which skew towards the stock falling, I predict a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise. The previous rounds' predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty within the market sentiment.  My prediction attempts to reconcile this uncertainty, while acknowledging the negative signals of Buffett's reduced holdings and Apple's valuation issues.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the S&P 500 has shown strong performance, and tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to report significant earnings growth (21.7% for the 'Magnificent Seven'). The Federal Reserve's anticipated decision to keep interest rates unchanged generally supports tech stocks. Additionally, the AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple. However, there are uncertainties, such as the Fed's commentary and upcoming economic data, which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong earnings expectations and positive tech sector momentum, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the mixed signals suggest a balanced outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a busy week for investors with numerous earnings reports from major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and a Federal Reserve meeting. The overall market sentiment has been positive, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying. Apple's earnings are expected to grow significantly as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks. However, there are mixed signals due to concerns over valuation and potential impacts from the Federal Reserve's commentary and economic data releases. Given the positive earnings expectations for Apple and the overall tech sector momentum, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the stock will go lower due to potential disappointing quarter results. Although he also mentions that the stock has historically gone up thousands of percent after being downgraded, the immediate negative comments may have a higher impact on the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiment and the potential for volatility, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the analysis of the news and the trends observed in previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple's holdings suggests concern over the company's valuation and growth potential. Despite mentioning Apple's steady free cash flow and service sector potential, the article emphasizes that the stock's current valuation does not reflect its slow growth. Moreover, the recent sales by Buffett indicate a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Other analysts predict further downward pressure on the stock due to valuation mismatches and decelerating earnings, which may negatively affect investor sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent news from Jim Cramer emphasizes a bearish outlook on Apple Inc., with concerns about potential disappointing earnings and his decision to reduce his stock holdings due to its significant portfolio weight. This sentiment is compounded by previous downgrades by analysts, including a notable downgrade reflecting weak iPhone sales and concerns about AI integration. While there is some discussion about potential growth in other segments of the company, the overall tone is negative, suggesting that investor sentiment may be swayed towards expecting a price decline. Historical context indicates that downgrades often lead to increased selling pressure. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on downgrades for several companies, including Apple, Ford, and Veeva, along with an upgrade for Twilio. Apple received an 'Underperform' rating from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and concerns about AI uptake, projecting a 13% downside. While there is an upgrade for Twilio, the substantial downgrade of Apple, a major market influencer, is likely to exert downward pressure. Considering prior rounds increasingly skewed towards a negative outlook for Apple, and the impact of analyst ratings on investor sentiment, I predict a higher probability of a stock price fall. The reasoning also considers that the information shows a downgrade for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stock holdings, citing overvaluation relative to Apple's recent earnings growth. While Apple's service sector is showing growth, overall revenue growth is slow.  This is a bearish signal, suggesting that the market may view Apple's current price as inflated.  Buffett's actions carry significant weight in the market, and this large sale will likely contribute to downward pressure.  While Apple's strong free cash flow and potential for dividend increases offer some support, the valuation concerns dominate the narrative. The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering all these factors, a higher probability is assigned to a stock price decline. However, the probability is not extreme, as Apple still possesses fundamental strengths and the market's reaction isn't always immediate or proportional to such news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the S&P 500 has shown strong performance, and tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to report significant earnings growth (21.7% for the 'Magnificent Seven'). The Federal Reserve's anticipated decision to keep interest rates unchanged generally supports tech stocks. Additionally, the AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple. However, there are uncertainties, such as the Fed's commentary and upcoming economic data, which could introduce volatility. Previous predictions from other models lean slightly bearish, with probabilities favoring a stock price fall. Given Apple's strong earnings expectations and positive tech sector momentum, but considering the mixed signals and cautious sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in Q4, and the Federal Reserve's anticipated decision to keep interest rates unchanged generally supports tech stocks. Additionally, the AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple. However, there are negative signals such as Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple missing earnings expectations, a downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, and Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings citing high valuation relative to earnings growth. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than a fall, reflecting the uncertainty and cautious sentiment in the market.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.32, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.68, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his decision to sell some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and his prediction that the company will miss earnings expectations. This cautious outlook, combined with the overall bearish sentiment expressed by other analysts and the trends observed in previous predictions, suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's stock has historically gone up after being downgraded, but the immediate negative comments from Cramer may have a higher impact on the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc.'s stock. On one hand, Warren Buffett has a large holding of Apple stock and retains confidence in the company's long-term prospects despite significant reductions. However, the valuations are considered stretched, and there is cautious sentiment about the earnings growth potential due to slow revenue growth and concerns about the stock's valuation relative to growth. Mixed analyst opinions contribute to a varied set of predictions, but overall, the bearish trend seen in previous rounds of predictions indicates more caution among investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
