      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc., particularly stating that he sold some stock because it became too significant a part of his portfolio. He also predicts that the company will miss earnings expectations and anticipates downgrades from analysts. These statements may lead investors to perceive a bearish outlook on AAPL, contributing to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Given Cramer's influence, his cautious outlook is likely to sway market sentiment negatively, overshadowing any potential positives around AAPL's long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on analyst ratings changes. Apple received a downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and concerns about AI integration, projecting a 13% downside. This suggests a negative outlook. While market sentiment can be influenced by various factors, a downgrade by a reputable firm typically exerts downward pressure on the stock. Therefore, a higher probability is given to the stock price falling. No other positive information in the provided excerpt is influencing the stock price in a positive manner.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple stock holdings, citing Apple's high valuation relative to its recent earnings growth.  While Apple's service sector is expanding, overall revenue growth is slow.  The article concludes that the current valuation makes Apple a less attractive buy. This suggests a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's large free cash flow and dividend potential provide some support. The fact that Buffett still holds a substantial position indicates some continued confidence.  Therefore, while the news leans bearish, due to Buffett's actions and the valuation concerns, it's unlikely to cause an immediate or drastic price drop.  The probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price decrease due to the prominent negative factors highlighted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) A strong start to the earnings season for S&P 500 companies, with tech heavyweights like Apple reporting. The 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in Q4, which is significantly higher than the rest of the S&P 500. This suggests positive sentiment around Apple's earnings. 2) The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision is expected to keep rates unchanged, which generally supports tech stocks. 3) The AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple as part of the broader tech sector. 4) The overall market sentiment is positive, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying recently. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong earnings expectations and the positive tech sector momentum, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article mentions Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he states that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the stock will go lower due to potential disappointing quarter results. However, he also mentions that the stock has historically gone up thousands of percent after being downgraded. This mixed sentiment suggests that the stock price movement is uncertain, but the immediate negative comments may have a slightly higher impact on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple reflects a level of confidence, his significant reduction in holdings suggests concern over valuation and growth potential. Recent performance shows modest growth in revenue and free cash flow, but these are offset by concerns over valuation and decelerating earnings. Additionally, the company's service segment could provide stability, reducing the risk of a severe downturn. However, the current valuation makes the stock less attractive for new investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news includes Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL) missing earnings expectations and his decision to reduce stock holdings due to AAPL becoming too significant a portion of his portfolio. Cramer's remarks often influence market sentiment, suggesting a bearish outlook for investors. However, other analysts have also pointed out the company's strong sales prospects in segments beyond iPhones and overall market conditions that could support stocks like AAPL. Given the mixed sentiments and increased analyst cautions, I predict a higher likelihood of a stock price fall. The previous models indicate a bearish sentiment overall, with probabilities assigned primarily leaning towards a decline in stock price amidst the current cautious economic outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on negative analyst ratings for Apple (downgrade from Jefferies) due to weak iPhone sales, concerns about AI integration, and a reduced outlook for future iPhone iterations and revenue growth. Jefferies' price target implies a 13% downside. This outweighs any potential positives. Previous predictions also mostly leaned towards a price decrease. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's significant reduction of Apple stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. While Buffett still holds a substantial amount, the sale is attributed to Apple's high valuation relative to its recent earnings growth.  Apple's revenue growth is slow, although its service sector is expanding.  The article concludes that the stock's high valuation makes it less attractive. This bearish sentiment is supported by previous predictions that lean toward a price decrease. However, Apple's strong free cash flow and dividend potential offer some mitigating factors. The fact that Buffett maintains a significant stake suggests some ongoing confidence in the company's long-term prospects.  Considering these factors and the overall bearish tone of the article, along with the previous predictions which skew towards the stock falling, I predict a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise. The previous rounds' predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty within the market sentiment.  My prediction attempts to reconcile this uncertainty, while acknowledging the negative signals of Buffett's reduced holdings and Apple's valuation issues.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the S&P 500 has shown strong performance, and tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to report significant earnings growth (21.7% for the 'Magnificent Seven'). The Federal Reserve's anticipated decision to keep interest rates unchanged generally supports tech stocks. Additionally, the AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple. However, there are uncertainties, such as the Fed's commentary and upcoming economic data, which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong earnings expectations and positive tech sector momentum, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the mixed signals suggest a balanced outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a busy week for investors with numerous earnings reports from major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and a Federal Reserve meeting. The overall market sentiment has been positive, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying. Apple's earnings are expected to grow significantly as part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks. However, there are mixed signals due to concerns over valuation and potential impacts from the Federal Reserve's commentary and economic data releases. Given the positive earnings expectations for Apple and the overall tech sector momentum, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions selling some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the stock will go lower due to potential disappointing quarter results. Although he also mentions that the stock has historically gone up thousands of percent after being downgraded, the immediate negative comments may have a higher impact on the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiment and the potential for volatility, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated based on the analysis of the news and the trends observed in previous predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple's holdings suggests concern over the company's valuation and growth potential. Despite mentioning Apple's steady free cash flow and service sector potential, the article emphasizes that the stock's current valuation does not reflect its slow growth. Moreover, the recent sales by Buffett indicate a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Other analysts predict further downward pressure on the stock due to valuation mismatches and decelerating earnings, which may negatively affect investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
