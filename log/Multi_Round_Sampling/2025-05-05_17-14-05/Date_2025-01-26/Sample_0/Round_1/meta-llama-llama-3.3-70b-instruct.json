(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc., particularly stating that he sold some stock because it became too significant a part of his portfolio. He also predicts that the company will miss earnings expectations and anticipates downgrades from analysts. These statements may lead investors to perceive a bearish outlook on AAPL, contributing to a higher probability of a stock price decline. Given Cramer's influence, his cautious outlook is likely to sway market sentiment negatively, overshadowing any potential positives around AAPL's long-term prospects.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on analyst ratings changes. Apple received a downgrade from Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales and concerns about AI integration, projecting a 13% downside. This suggests a negative outlook. While market sentiment can be influenced by various factors, a downgrade by a reputable firm typically exerts downward pressure on the stock. Therefore, a higher probability is given to the stock price falling. No other positive information in the provided excerpt is influencing the stock price in a positive manner.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple stock holdings, citing Apple's high valuation relative to its recent earnings growth.  While Apple's service sector is expanding, overall revenue growth is slow.  The article concludes that the current valuation makes Apple a less attractive buy. This suggests a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's large free cash flow and dividend potential provide some support. The fact that Buffett still holds a substantial position indicates some continued confidence.  Therefore, while the news leans bearish, due to Buffett's actions and the valuation concerns, it's unlikely to cause an immediate or drastic price drop.  The probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price decrease due to the prominent negative factors highlighted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) A strong start to the earnings season for S&P 500 companies, with tech heavyweights like Apple reporting. The 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in Q4, which is significantly higher than the rest of the S&P 500. This suggests positive sentiment around Apple's earnings. 2) The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision is expected to keep rates unchanged, which generally supports tech stocks. 3) The AI rally sparked by Trump's $500 billion investment announcement could indirectly benefit Apple as part of the broader tech sector. 4) The overall market sentiment is positive, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying recently. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong earnings expectations and the positive tech sector momentum, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article mentions Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he states that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and believes the stock will go lower due to potential disappointing quarter results. However, he also mentions that the stock has historically gone up thousands of percent after being downgraded. This mixed sentiment suggests that the stock price movement is uncertain, but the immediate negative comments may have a slightly higher impact on the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett's continued investment in Apple reflects a level of confidence, his significant reduction in holdings suggests concern over valuation and growth potential. Recent performance shows modest growth in revenue and free cash flow, but these are offset by concerns over valuation and decelerating earnings. Additionally, the company's service segment could provide stability, reducing the risk of a severe downturn. However, the current valuation makes the stock less attractive for new investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
