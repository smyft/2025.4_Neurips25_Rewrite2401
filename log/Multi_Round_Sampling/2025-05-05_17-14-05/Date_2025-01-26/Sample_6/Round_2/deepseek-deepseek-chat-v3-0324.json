(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. potentially missing its quarterly results and his decision to reduce exposure to the stock, suggesting a bearish outlook. Historically, downgrades and concerns about company performance can negatively impact stock prices. Furthermore, the inclusion of AI stocks in discussions may create a shift in investor interest away from AAPL towards those perceived as having higher potential returns. These factors lead to an increased probability of AAPL's stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed and respected, often signaling a positive outlook on the company's future. The headline's phrasing, 'Is It a Buy Now?', directly implies that the stock is worth considering for investment. While the article itself would need to contain a deeper analysis, the headline's tone is generally positive. Therefore, this news is more likely to encourage buying pressure than selling pressure, leading to a higher probability of a price increase. We are assigning probabilities based on the headline alone. A full article analysis would be needed for greater accuracy.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its large portfolio weighting.  While he anticipates Apple missing earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's history of rising after downgrades. His statement reflects a portfolio management decision rather than a definitive negative outlook on the company's long-term prospects. The article also highlights other AI-related stocks as potentially more promising investment opportunities in the near term. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, although slightly leaning towards a downward trend in the short term due to the immediate sell-off by a prominent investor and anticipated earnings miss.  The long-term outlook is less affected by this single piece of news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights several key factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market momentum, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying, particularly in tech stocks. 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is part of a broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech earnings wave expected to show strong growth. 3) A favorable environment for tech due to Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, which has already boosted related stocks. 4) The Federal Reserve's expected decision to hold rates steady, reducing near-term uncertainty. However, potential risks include: 1) Any unexpected negative earnings surprises from Apple or peers. 2) Fed Chair Powell's press conference comments, which could introduce volatility. Overall, the bullish trends in tech and positive earnings expectations outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups. The company has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal that aims to assess risks of its DEI programs. This demonstrates Apple's dedication to its values and culture. Given the current market trends and societal pressures, Apple's stance on DEI may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively to Apple's decision. Overall, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a scheduled Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's noted that several Big Tech companies including Apple will release earnings, potentially impacting the stock price. While the recent market rally and positive economic indicators could support bullish sentiment, upcoming earnings and central bank decisions can introduce volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns over Apple potentially missing its quarterly earnings, alongside his decision to reduce his stock holdings. This suggests a bearish outlook for the company in the short term. Additionally, the mention of AI stocks as potentially more promising investments indicates a shift in investor focus away from AAPL. Despite some positive market trends and Apple's strong brand, the immediate impact of Cramer's comments and the expected earnings miss likely outweigh these factors, leading to a greater probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is primarily positive, focusing on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple. Buffett's investment is generally seen as a strong endorsement. However, the phrasing \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests that the article itself might explore both positive and negative aspects, as it's a question rather than a statement. Considering other models' previous round predictions, there's a spread of opinions, and some noted risks like investor sentiment shifting away from AAPL. This suggests the real impact will depend on sub factors. In this round I try to give a somewhat average view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing is the most impactful piece of information in this news. While he expresses concerns about Apple missing earnings, this seems secondary to his portfolio management decision.  His prediction of future downgrades followed by upgrades is consistent with AAPL's historical price behavior and doesn't provide a strong signal for the short-term price movement.  The other aspects of the article (AI focus, general market trends) are less directly relevant to Apple's immediate price movement than Cramer's actions.  Considering the past predictions, there is a wide range of views, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term future, with many being cautiously bearish.  Based on Cramer's sales alone, the probability of the stock falling should be higher than rising, but the fact that this is related to portfolio management, not necessarily negative sentiment towards Apple directly, tempers this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market momentum, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying, particularly in tech stocks. 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is part of a broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech earnings wave expected to show strong growth. 3) A favorable environment for tech due to Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, which has already boosted related stocks. 4) The Federal Reserve's expected decision to hold rates steady, reducing near-term uncertainty. However, potential risks include: 1) Any unexpected negative earnings surprises from Apple or peers. 2) Fed Chair Powell's press conference comments, which could introduce volatility. Overall, the bullish trends in tech and positive earnings expectations outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups. The company has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal that aims to assess risks of its DEI programs. This demonstrates Apple's dedication to its values and culture. Given the current market trends and societal pressures, Apple's stance on DEI may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively to Apple's decision. Overall, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups. This demonstrates Apple's dedication to its values and culture. Given the current market trends and societal pressures, Apple's stance on DEI may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively to Apple's decision. The fact that other prominent companies, such as Costco, are also defending their DEI practices suggests a trend of companies standing firm on their values, which could lead to a positive market reaction. Considering the previous predictions, there is a range of opinions, but the overall trend seems to be neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a scheduled Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's noted that several Big Tech companies including Apple will release earnings, potentially impacting the stock price. While the recent market rally and positive economic indicators could support bullish sentiment, upcoming earnings and central bank decisions can introduce volatility. Additionally, there are mixed signals from different predictions provided by other models, indicating varying degrees of confidence. Considering these factors, the probability of both a rise and fall in stock price appears balanced.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
