(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. potentially missing its quarterly results and his decision to reduce exposure to the stock, suggesting a bearish outlook. Historically, downgrades and concerns about company performance can negatively impact stock prices. Furthermore, the inclusion of AI stocks in discussions may create a shift in investor interest away from AAPL towards those perceived as having higher potential returns. These factors lead to an increased probability of AAPL's stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed and respected, often signaling a positive outlook on the company's future. The headline's phrasing, 'Is It a Buy Now?', directly implies that the stock is worth considering for investment. While the article itself would need to contain a deeper analysis, the headline's tone is generally positive. Therefore, this news is more likely to encourage buying pressure than selling pressure, leading to a higher probability of a price increase. We are assigning probabilities based on the headline alone. A full article analysis would be needed for greater accuracy.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial commentator, announced that he sold some of his Apple stock because of its large portfolio weighting.  While he anticipates Apple missing earnings and predicts further downgrades before an eventual upgrade, he also notes the stock's history of rising after downgrades. His statement reflects a portfolio management decision rather than a definitive negative outlook on the company's long-term prospects. The article also highlights other AI-related stocks as potentially more promising investment opportunities in the near term. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, although slightly leaning towards a downward trend in the short term due to the immediate sell-off by a prominent investor and anticipated earnings miss.  The long-term outlook is less affected by this single piece of news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights several key factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market momentum, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying, particularly in tech stocks. 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is part of a broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech earnings wave expected to show strong growth. 3) A favorable environment for tech due to Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, which has already boosted related stocks. 4) The Federal Reserve's expected decision to hold rates steady, reducing near-term uncertainty. However, potential risks include: 1) Any unexpected negative earnings surprises from Apple or peers. 2) Fed Chair Powell's press conference comments, which could introduce volatility. Overall, the bullish trends in tech and positive earnings expectations outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups. The company has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal that aims to assess risks of its DEI programs. This demonstrates Apple's dedication to its values and culture. Given the current market trends and societal pressures, Apple's stance on DEI may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively to Apple's decision. Overall, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a scheduled Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's noted that several Big Tech companies including Apple will release earnings, potentially impacting the stock price. While the recent market rally and positive economic indicators could support bullish sentiment, upcoming earnings and central bank decisions can introduce volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns over Apple potentially missing its quarterly earnings, alongside his decision to reduce his stock holdings. This suggests a bearish outlook for the company in the short term. Additionally, the mention of AI stocks as potentially more promising investments indicates a shift in investor focus away from AAPL. Despite some positive market trends and Apple's strong brand, the immediate impact of Cramer's comments and the expected earnings miss likely outweigh these factors, leading to a greater probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is primarily positive, focusing on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple. Buffett's investment is generally seen as a strong endorsement. However, the phrasing \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests that the article itself might explore both positive and negative aspects, as it's a question rather than a statement. Considering other models' previous round predictions, there's a spread of opinions, and some noted risks like investor sentiment shifting away from AAPL. This suggests the real impact will depend on sub factors. In this round I try to give a somewhat average view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's statement about selling some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing is the most impactful piece of information in this news. While he expresses concerns about Apple missing earnings, this seems secondary to his portfolio management decision.  His prediction of future downgrades followed by upgrades is consistent with AAPL's historical price behavior and doesn't provide a strong signal for the short-term price movement.  The other aspects of the article (AI focus, general market trends) are less directly relevant to Apple's immediate price movement than Cramer's actions.  Considering the past predictions, there is a wide range of views, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's short-term future, with many being cautiously bearish.  Based on Cramer's sales alone, the probability of the stock falling should be higher than rising, but the fact that this is related to portfolio management, not necessarily negative sentiment towards Apple directly, tempers this prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market momentum, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying, particularly in tech stocks. 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is part of a broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech earnings wave expected to show strong growth. 3) A favorable environment for tech due to Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, which has already boosted related stocks. 4) The Federal Reserve's expected decision to hold rates steady, reducing near-term uncertainty. However, potential risks include: 1) Any unexpected negative earnings surprises from Apple or peers. 2) Fed Chair Powell's press conference comments, which could introduce volatility. Overall, the bullish trends in tech and positive earnings expectations outweigh the risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups. The company has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal that aims to assess risks of its DEI programs. This demonstrates Apple's dedication to its values and culture. Given the current market trends and societal pressures, Apple's stance on DEI may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively to Apple's decision. Overall, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups. This demonstrates Apple's dedication to its values and culture. Given the current market trends and societal pressures, Apple's stance on DEI may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively to Apple's decision. The fact that other prominent companies, such as Costco, are also defending their DEI practices suggests a trend of companies standing firm on their values, which could lead to a positive market reaction. Considering the previous predictions, there is a range of opinions, but the overall trend seems to be neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the market, including Big Tech earnings reports, a scheduled Federal Reserve meeting, and political developments under Trump's administration. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's noted that several Big Tech companies including Apple will release earnings, potentially impacting the stock price. While the recent market rally and positive economic indicators could support bullish sentiment, upcoming earnings and central bank decisions can introduce volatility. Additionally, there are mixed signals from different predictions provided by other models, indicating varying degrees of confidence. Considering these factors, the probability of both a rise and fall in stock price appears balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates Mac Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. potentially missing its quarterly earnings, which combined with his decision to reduce his exposure to the stock suggests a bearish short-term outlook. Historical precedence shows that comments from prominent investors like Cramer can influence market sentiment, leading to potential stock price declines. While there are overall positive market trends affecting tech stocks, the negative commentary and anticipated earnings miss create stronger downward pressure on Apple's stock. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price decline over an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The headline focuses on Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple, which generally signals confidence and a positive outlook. This could attract other investors and drive up demand. However, the 'Is It a Buy Now?' phrasing suggests the article may contain balanced viewpoints, potentially addressing risks or downsides. Reviewing the previous rounds' predictions, there's a wide range, reflecting differing interpretations of Apple's prospects and external market factors. Given Buffett's influence, a positive initial reaction is likely, but the article's detailed content (which is not available) will ultimately determine the sustainable impact. Considering this and aiming for a more moderate prediction compared to the initial enthusiasm, a slightly higher probability is given to a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing, not necessarily due to negative sentiment towards the company's prospects. While he anticipates an earnings miss and potential downgrades, he also acknowledges Apple's historical tendency to rebound after such events. This creates uncertainty.  The differing predictions from various AI models further highlight the ambiguity of the situation.  Some models focus on the positive market momentum, while others emphasize Cramer's sell-off and the potential shift towards AI stocks. The lack of overwhelmingly negative news, coupled with the overall market trends and the potential for a post-downgrade rally, prevents a strongly bearish prediction.  The portfolio rebalancing aspect mitigates the impact of Cramer's opinion, suggesting a more neutral outlook compared to a purely negative interpretation of his statement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights several key factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market momentum, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying, particularly in tech stocks. 2) Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is part of a broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech earnings wave expected to show strong growth. 3) A favorable environment for tech due to Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement, which has already boosted related stocks. 4) The Federal Reserve's expected decision to hold rates steady, reducing near-term uncertainty.

Several prominent companies, including Apple, are defending their DEI practices. This stance may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively. Additionally, the broader market trends and upcoming earnings reports may impact Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed signals and various predictions from previous rounds, there seems to be a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to Apple's strong stance on DEI and its potential alignment with investor values prioritizing ESG factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, despite facing challenges from conservative groups.

While the recent market rally and positive economic indicators could support bullish sentiment, upcoming earnings and central bank decisions can introduce volatility. Additionally, there are mixed signals from different predictions provided by other models, indicating varying degrees of confidence. However, considering the strong historical performance of AAPL and the mixed signals, the probability of both scenarios remains fairly balanced.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. potentially missing its quarterly earnings and his decision to reduce his stock holdings. This suggests a bearish outlook in the short term. Additionally, the mention of AI stocks as more promising investments indicates a shift in investor focus away from AAPL.

However, the phrasing \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests the article may analyze both positive and negative aspects. Jim Cramer's previous concerns and portfolio adjustments also create some uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals from the news and the various predictions in previous rounds, the influence of Buffett's investment likely provides a slight upward pressure, but it's tempered by other mentioned market dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news is mixed. Jim Cramer's selling of Apple stock due to portfolio rebalancing is a significant bearish signal, suggesting a short-term negative impact. His prediction of an earnings miss further strengthens this bearish sentiment. However, his comment about the stock historically rising after downgrades introduces a counter-argument.  The overall market trends (positive for tech), and the potential for a post-downgrade rally, prevent a strongly negative prediction. The absence of overwhelmingly negative news and the historic resilience of AAPL further lessen the pessimistic outlook. Considering the conflicting signals and the analysis of previous predictions from various models, a moderately bearish outlook is warranted, but not extremely negative.  The probabilities reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a fall due to Cramer's action, but acknowledging the possibility of a positive reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a mix of factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price. On the positive side, the overall market momentum is strong, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallying, particularly in tech stocks. Apple's upcoming earnings report is part of a broader 'Magnificent Seven' tech earnings wave expected to show strong growth. Additionally, Trump's $500 billion AI investment announcement has boosted related tech stocks, and the Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady, reducing near-term uncertainty. However, potential risks include any unexpected negative earnings surprises from Apple or its peers, and volatility from Fed Chair Powell's press conference comments. Given the bullish trends in tech and positive earnings expectations, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the risks introduce some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices despite facing challenges from conservative groups.

However, there is also a risk that conservative groups and investors may react negatively.
