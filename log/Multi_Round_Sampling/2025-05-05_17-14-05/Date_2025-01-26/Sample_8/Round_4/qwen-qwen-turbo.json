(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns for Apple, particularly around slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Additionally, market analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising, especially considering the sentiment expressed in the news. The options market predicts a price movement of around 4.6%, indicating increased volatility. Therefore, the probability of a price drop is estimated to be higher than that of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors. Firstly, the overall market is in a rally, and the tech sector is leading gains. Secondly, Apple is among the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, which are expected to drive significant earnings growth. Thirdly, a strong earnings report is anticipated for the tech sector broadly. However, the Fed's upcoming announcement and Powell's comments, though expected to be neutral, could introduce volatility. Trump's influence and potential clash with the Fed adds further uncertainty. The GDP estimate is solid, and PCE data is also due. Apple reports earnings on Thursday, which will be the primary driver of its stock price. Given the positive market sentiment, tech sector strength and the anticipated neutral effect of macro factors, a slightly higher probability is given to the stock price increasing, but considering existing rally and potential for disappointment in forward guidance during earnings call a sizable probability is given for price declines as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates. While the overall market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data) are mentioned, their impact on AAPL is overshadowed by the specific concerns about the company's performance. The probabilities assigned reflect the weight given to these specific company-related factors over general market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service segment is growing, the stock's valuation is stretched, trading at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is high given the company's recent performance. The article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and nearly stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. Warren Buffett's investments are closely watched by the financial community, and his endorsement can lead to increased investor interest and confidence. Additionally, Apple Inc. is a dividend-paying stock, which can attract income-seeking investors. However, it's also important to consider that the stock price may already reflect this information, and the market's reaction might be muted. Furthermore, the article's question 'Is It a Buy Now?' might prompt some investors to take a closer look, potentially leading to increased buying activity.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant headwinds for Apple Inc. stemming from slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and a generally bearish outlook on its upcoming earnings report. Analysts have been lowering revenue forecasts, and the anticipated earnings guidance is expected to underwhelm investors. The options market indicates a distinct probability of volatility with an expected move of ~4.6%. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, consistent with the bearish sentiment expressed in the news and prior predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and the tech sector is expected to have strong earnings growth, there's uncertainty surrounding the Fed's policy decision and potential clashes between the administration and the Fed. The article specifically notes Apple's earnings report is due on Thursday and will be a key driver. Previous predictions leaned bearish, citing concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption, but also had varied opinions. Considering the overall positive market sentiment and the potential for a strong tech earnings season, but also the individual concerns related to Apple, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance compared to previous rounds. The upcoming earnings will be a key deciding factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the article highlights concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and potentially disappointing earnings guidance, several counterpoints exist.  Previous predictions vary widely, showcasing significant uncertainty. The overall market sentiment is positive, with the tech sector performing well. The article's focus on Apple's potential downside is balanced by its mention of the broader market strength and the fact that Apple is a significant component in major indices. While the article explicitly recommends selling Apple, this recommendation is presented alongside similar advice to buy Meta. We have to consider that, unlike Meta, which is reporting earnings with already high expectations, Apple's potential for disappointment is more central to this analysis. It is worth noting that this article is from Investing.com, a site that frequently includes promotional materials, which may influence the article's sentiment. Taking into consideration the bearish sentiment expressed explicitly within the news and some of the previous predictions, but also acknowledging the inherent volatility and positive broad market trends, I am assigning a lower probability to a price increase than a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term. Previous predictions also largely favor a price fall, with only one model suggesting a higher probability of a rise, which seems less supported by the current news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. However, considering the varied predictions from other models, it's essential to weigh both positive and negative factors. Some models emphasize the bearish outlook due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and anticipated disappointing guidance. Others point to the overall market rally, tech sector strength, and the potential for a strong earnings report. Given the mixed sentiment and considering the information from previous rounds, the probabilities should lean towards a cautious stance. The investment by Warren Buffett is a positive signal, but the concerns about Apple's performance and valuation cannot be overlooked.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio, concerns regarding iPhone sales and innovation momentum, potential analyst downgrades, and anticipated disappointing earnings. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the news content and historical predictions, there is a stronger indication of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates significant challenges for Apple Inc., including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and recent downgrades to revenue forecasts by analysts. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is expected to disappoint investors. While there is some overall positive sentiment in the market due to the strength of other tech stocks, the specific concerns around Apple overshadow this, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. The options market also indicates a potential movement of 4.6%, contributing to the uncertainty and volatility. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a strong expectation that the stock price will fall rather than rise, consistent with the sentiment from multiple analyses and the current market context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The positive aspects include the overall market rally, especially in the tech sector where Apple is a heavyweight, and the fact that earnings for big tech are expected to be strong. However, there are also negatives such as concerns about iPhone sales, AI innovation momentum, and potentially disappointing earnings guidance. Additionally, macro-economic factors like the Fed's rate decision and Trump's potential clash with the Fed add uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, the sentiment is largely bearish, emphasizing downside risk due to Apple-specific concerns. Given the competing forces, I slightly increase the probability of a rise compared to the most bearish predictions, while still maintaining a negative overall sentiment, accounting for potential downside surprises or disappointing forward guidance following the release of Apple's quarterly earnings results on Thursday. The earnings report will likely function as a primary driver for the stock price movement following this announcement. Therefore, I predict slightly higher probability of price falling than rising but adjusted from last rounds as the results might be better then the bearish predictions are estimating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the general market sentiment is positive, and Apple is a major player in the tech sector expected to have strong earnings, several significant headwinds are highlighted. These include slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum specifically regarding AI, and anticipated disappointing guidance in its upcoming earnings report.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downwards, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.  The options market predicts a considerable potential price swing (around 4.6%), suggesting volatility.  However, Apple remains a significant company with substantial market capitalization and is part of major indices. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the negative factors specific to the company and uncertainty about the market's reaction to its earnings report and the broader market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data), I assign a higher probability to a price fall.  The weight given to company-specific news compared to broader market trends contributes to this assessment. The significant negative information specific to Apple outweighs the positive broader market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Additionally, weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly favor a price fall, with only a few suggesting a higher probability of a rise, which seems less supported by the current news. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service segment is growing, the stock's valuation is stretched, trading at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is high given the company's recent performance. The article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and nearly stagnant sales and profits. Considering the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, with some models emphasizing bearish outlooks due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, and others pointing to the overall market rally and tech sector strength, a cautious stance is warranted. The majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher likelihood of the stock price falling, driven by concerns about Apple's performance and valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. However, considering the varied predictions from other models and the mixed sentiment expressed, it's essential to weigh both positive and negative factors. Many models emphasize the bearish outlook due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and anticipated disappointing guidance. While the overall market rally and tech sector strength are positive factors, the concerns about Apple's performance and valuation cannot be overlooked. Given the mixed sentiment and considering the information from previous rounds, a cautious stance is warranted. The investment by Warren Buffett is a positive signal, but the concerns about Apple's performance are significant.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio, concerns regarding iPhone sales and innovation momentum, potential analyst downgrades, and anticipated disappointing earnings. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the news content and historical predictions, there is a stronger indication of the stock price falling.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis indicates a significant bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to several factors, including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and lowered revenue forecasts from analysts. The upcoming earnings report is anticipated to disappoint, contributing to a probability of stock price decline. The mixed sentiment from the broader tech market is overshadowed by specific negative concerns about Apple, leading to a higher likelihood of a price drop than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The overriding sentiment surrounding Apple is negative, driven by concerns of slowing iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and potentially disappointing earnings. While the broader market and tech sector show overall strength, Apple-specific concerns are weighing heavily. Previous predictions reflect a strong bias towards a price decline. While Buffett's investment is a positive signal, it doesn't fully negate the bearish concerns. The Fed meeting introduces volatility, but the spotlight will primarily remain on Apple's earnings, where any disappointment could drastically impact the stock price reinforcing downwards estimates.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader market shows positive sentiment and the tech sector is expected to perform well, specific concerns about Apple outweigh the general optimism.  Slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly in AI), and anticipated disappointing earnings guidance are significant headwinds. Analyst downgrades and a bearish outlook from multiple sources reinforce these negative factors.  The options market suggests considerable volatility, which is consistent with uncertainty around the earnings report.  While Warren Buffett's investment is positive, his recent reduction of holdings and the overall negativity toward Apple's growth trajectory are more influential. The consensus from previous predictions leans heavily toward a price fall, further supporting a bearish outlook for Apple this week. The probability of a price fall is notably higher, reflecting the weight of the negative factors relative to the positive market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance.
