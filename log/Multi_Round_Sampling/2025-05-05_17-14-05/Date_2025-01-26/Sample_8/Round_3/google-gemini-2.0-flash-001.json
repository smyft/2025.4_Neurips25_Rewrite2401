      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

Follow him on X @_joshschafer.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns for Apple, particularly around slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Additionally, market analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising, especially considering the sentiment expressed in the news. The options market predicts a price movement of around 4.6%, indicating increased volatility. Therefore, the probability of a price drop is estimated to be higher than that of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors. Firstly, the overall market is in a rally, and the tech sector is leading gains. Secondly, Apple is among the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, which are expected to drive significant earnings growth. Thirdly, a strong earnings report is anticipated for the tech sector broadly. However, the Fed's upcoming announcement and Powell's comments, though expected to be neutral, could introduce volatility. Trump's influence and potential clash with the Fed adds further uncertainty. The GDP estimate is solid, and PCE data is also due. Apple reports earnings on Thursday, which will be the primary driver of its stock price. Given the positive market sentiment, tech sector strength and the anticipated neutral effect of macro factors, a slightly higher probability is given to the stock price increasing, but considering existing rally and potential for disappointment in forward guidance during earnings call a sizable probability is given for price declines as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates. While the overall market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data) are mentioned, their impact on AAPL is overshadowed by the specific concerns about the company's performance. The probabilities assigned reflect the weight given to these specific company-related factors over general market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service segment is growing, the stock's valuation is stretched, trading at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is high given the company's recent performance. The article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and nearly stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. Warren Buffett's investments are closely watched by the financial community, and his endorsement can lead to increased investor interest and confidence. Additionally, Apple Inc. is a dividend-paying stock, which can attract income-seeking investors. However, it's also important to consider that the stock price may already reflect this information, and the market's reaction might be muted. Furthermore, the article's question 'Is It a Buy Now?' might prompt some investors to take a closer look, potentially leading to increased buying activity.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant headwinds for Apple Inc. stemming from slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and a generally bearish outlook on its upcoming earnings report. Analysts have been lowering revenue forecasts, and the anticipated earnings guidance is expected to underwhelm investors. The options market indicates a distinct probability of volatility with an expected move of ~4.6%. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, consistent with the bearish sentiment expressed in the news and prior predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and the tech sector is expected to have strong earnings growth, there's uncertainty surrounding the Fed's policy decision and potential clashes between the administration and the Fed. The article specifically notes Apple's earnings report is due on Thursday and will be a key driver. Previous predictions leaned bearish, citing concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption, but also had varied opinions. Considering the overall positive market sentiment and the potential for a strong tech earnings season, but also the individual concerns related to Apple, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance compared to previous rounds. The upcoming earnings will be a key deciding factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the article highlights concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and potentially disappointing earnings guidance, several counterpoints exist.  Previous predictions vary widely, showcasing significant uncertainty. The overall market sentiment is positive, with the tech sector performing well. The article's focus on Apple's potential downside is balanced by its mention of the broader market strength and the fact that Apple is a significant component in major indices. While the article explicitly recommends selling Apple, this recommendation is presented alongside similar advice to buy Meta. We have to consider that, unlike Meta, which is reporting earnings with already high expectations, Apple's potential for disappointment is more central to this analysis. It is worth noting that this article is from Investing.com, a site that frequently includes promotional materials, which may influence the article's sentiment. Taking into consideration the bearish sentiment expressed explicitly within the news and some of the previous predictions, but also acknowledging the inherent volatility and positive broad market trends, I am assigning a lower probability to a price increase than a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term. Previous predictions also largely favor a price fall, with only one model suggesting a higher probability of a rise, which seems less supported by the current news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. However, considering the varied predictions from other models, it's essential to weigh both positive and negative factors. Some models emphasize the bearish outlook due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and anticipated disappointing guidance. Others point to the overall market rally, tech sector strength, and the potential for a strong earnings report. Given the mixed sentiment and considering the information from previous rounds, the probabilities should lean towards a cautious stance. The investment by Warren Buffett is a positive signal, but the concerns about Apple's performance and valuation cannot be overlooked.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio, concerns regarding iPhone sales and innovation momentum, potential analyst downgrades, and anticipated disappointing earnings. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the news content and historical predictions, there is a stronger indication of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates significant challenges for Apple Inc., including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and recent downgrades to revenue forecasts by analysts. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is expected to disappoint investors. While there is some overall positive sentiment in the market due to the strength of other tech stocks, the specific concerns around Apple overshadow this, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. The options market also indicates a potential movement of 4.6%, contributing to the uncertainty and volatility. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a strong expectation that the stock price will fall rather than rise, consistent with the sentiment from multiple analyses and the current market context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The positive aspects include the overall market rally, especially in the tech sector where Apple is a heavyweight, and the fact that earnings for big tech are expected to be strong. However, there are also negatives such as concerns about iPhone sales, AI innovation momentum, and potentially disappointing earnings guidance. Additionally, macro-economic factors like the Fed's rate decision and Trump's potential clash with the Fed add uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, the sentiment is largely bearish, emphasizing downside risk due to Apple-specific concerns. Given the competing forces, I slightly increase the probability of a rise compared to the most bearish predictions, while still maintaining a negative overall sentiment, accounting for potential downside surprises or disappointing forward guidance following the release of Apple's quarterly earnings results on Thursday. The earnings report will likely function as a primary driver for the stock price movement following this announcement. Therefore, I predict slightly higher probability of price falling than rising but adjusted from last rounds as the results might be better then the bearish predictions are estimating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the general market sentiment is positive, and Apple is a major player in the tech sector expected to have strong earnings, several significant headwinds are highlighted. These include slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum specifically regarding AI, and anticipated disappointing guidance in its upcoming earnings report.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downwards, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.  The options market predicts a considerable potential price swing (around 4.6%), suggesting volatility.  However, Apple remains a significant company with substantial market capitalization and is part of major indices. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the negative factors specific to the company and uncertainty about the market's reaction to its earnings report and the broader market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data), I assign a higher probability to a price fall.  The weight given to company-specific news compared to broader market trends contributes to this assessment. The significant negative information specific to Apple outweighs the positive broader market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Additionally, weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly favor a price fall, with only a few suggesting a higher probability of a rise, which seems less supported by the current news. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.
