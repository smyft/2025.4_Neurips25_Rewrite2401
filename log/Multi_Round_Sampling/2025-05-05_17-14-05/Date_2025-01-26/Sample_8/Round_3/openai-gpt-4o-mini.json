(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns for Apple, particularly around slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Additionally, market analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising, especially considering the sentiment expressed in the news. The options market predicts a price movement of around 4.6%, indicating increased volatility. Therefore, the probability of a price drop is estimated to be higher than that of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis considers several factors. Firstly, the overall market is in a rally, and the tech sector is leading gains. Secondly, Apple is among the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, which are expected to drive significant earnings growth. Thirdly, a strong earnings report is anticipated for the tech sector broadly. However, the Fed's upcoming announcement and Powell's comments, though expected to be neutral, could introduce volatility. Trump's influence and potential clash with the Fed adds further uncertainty. The GDP estimate is solid, and PCE data is also due. Apple reports earnings on Thursday, which will be the primary driver of its stock price. Given the positive market sentiment, tech sector strength and the anticipated neutral effect of macro factors, a slightly higher probability is given to the stock price increasing, but considering existing rally and potential for disappointment in forward guidance during earnings call a sizable probability is given for price declines as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates. While the overall market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data) are mentioned, their impact on AAPL is overshadowed by the specific concerns about the company's performance. The probabilities assigned reflect the weight given to these specific company-related factors over general market uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service segment is growing, the stock's valuation is stretched, trading at 31.7 times trailing free cash flow, which is high given the company's recent performance. The article concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock now due to its rich valuation and nearly stagnant sales and profits. Based on this analysis, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. Warren Buffett's investments are closely watched by the financial community, and his endorsement can lead to increased investor interest and confidence. Additionally, Apple Inc. is a dividend-paying stock, which can attract income-seeking investors. However, it's also important to consider that the stock price may already reflect this information, and the market's reaction might be muted. Furthermore, the article's question 'Is It a Buy Now?' might prompt some investors to take a closer look, potentially leading to increased buying activity.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant headwinds for Apple Inc. stemming from slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and a generally bearish outlook on its upcoming earnings report. Analysts have been lowering revenue forecasts, and the anticipated earnings guidance is expected to underwhelm investors. The options market indicates a distinct probability of volatility with an expected move of ~4.6%. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising, consistent with the bearish sentiment expressed in the news and prior predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' and the tech sector is expected to have strong earnings growth, there's uncertainty surrounding the Fed's policy decision and potential clashes between the administration and the Fed. The article specifically notes Apple's earnings report is due on Thursday and will be a key driver. Previous predictions leaned bearish, citing concerns about iPhone sales and AI adoption, but also had varied opinions. Considering the overall positive market sentiment and the potential for a strong tech earnings season, but also the individual concerns related to Apple, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly towards a more neutral stance compared to previous rounds. The upcoming earnings will be a key deciding factor.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the article highlights concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation, and potentially disappointing earnings guidance, several counterpoints exist.  Previous predictions vary widely, showcasing significant uncertainty. The overall market sentiment is positive, with the tech sector performing well. The article's focus on Apple's potential downside is balanced by its mention of the broader market strength and the fact that Apple is a significant component in major indices. While the article explicitly recommends selling Apple, this recommendation is presented alongside similar advice to buy Meta. We have to consider that, unlike Meta, which is reporting earnings with already high expectations, Apple's potential for disappointment is more central to this analysis. It is worth noting that this article is from Investing.com, a site that frequently includes promotional materials, which may influence the article's sentiment. Taking into consideration the bearish sentiment expressed explicitly within the news and some of the previous predictions, but also acknowledging the inherent volatility and positive broad market trends, I am assigning a lower probability to a price increase than a price decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies due to weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term. Previous predictions also largely favor a price fall, with only one model suggesting a higher probability of a rise, which seems less supported by the current news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. However, considering the varied predictions from other models, it's essential to weigh both positive and negative factors. Some models emphasize the bearish outlook due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and anticipated disappointing guidance. Others point to the overall market rally, tech sector strength, and the potential for a strong earnings report. Given the mixed sentiment and considering the information from previous rounds, the probabilities should lean towards a cautious stance. The investment by Warren Buffett is a positive signal, but the concerns about Apple's performance and valuation cannot be overlooked.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio, concerns regarding iPhone sales and innovation momentum, potential analyst downgrades, and anticipated disappointing earnings. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the news content and historical predictions, there is a stronger indication of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates significant challenges for Apple Inc., including slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and recent downgrades to revenue forecasts by analysts. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is expected to disappoint investors. While there is some overall positive sentiment in the market due to the strength of other tech stocks, the specific concerns around Apple overshadow this, leading to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. The options market also indicates a potential movement of 4.6%, contributing to the uncertainty and volatility. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a strong expectation that the stock price will fall rather than rise, consistent with the sentiment from multiple analyses and the current market context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The positive aspects include the overall market rally, especially in the tech sector where Apple is a heavyweight, and the fact that earnings for big tech are expected to be strong. However, there are also negatives such as concerns about iPhone sales, AI innovation momentum, and potentially disappointing earnings guidance. Additionally, macro-economic factors like the Fed's rate decision and Trump's potential clash with the Fed add uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, the sentiment is largely bearish, emphasizing downside risk due to Apple-specific concerns. Given the competing forces, I slightly increase the probability of a rise compared to the most bearish predictions, while still maintaining a negative overall sentiment, accounting for potential downside surprises or disappointing forward guidance following the release of Apple's quarterly earnings results on Thursday. The earnings report will likely function as a primary driver for the stock price movement following this announcement. Therefore, I predict slightly higher probability of price falling than rising but adjusted from last rounds as the results might be better then the bearish predictions are estimating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the general market sentiment is positive, and Apple is a major player in the tech sector expected to have strong earnings, several significant headwinds are highlighted. These include slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum specifically regarding AI, and anticipated disappointing guidance in its upcoming earnings report.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downwards, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.  The options market predicts a considerable potential price swing (around 4.6%), suggesting volatility.  However, Apple remains a significant company with substantial market capitalization and is part of major indices. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the negative factors specific to the company and uncertainty about the market's reaction to its earnings report and the broader market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data), I assign a higher probability to a price fall.  The weight given to company-specific news compared to broader market trends contributes to this assessment. The significant negative information specific to Apple outweighs the positive broader market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales, a subdued AI outlook, and expectations of missing revenue growth guidance. The downgrade to 'Underperform' with a price target implying a 13% downside suggests significant negative sentiment. Additionally, weakness in the consumer electronics market and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone further contribute to the negative outlook. Previous predictions from various models also predominantly favor a price fall, with only a few suggesting a higher probability of a rise, which seems less supported by the current news. Given the severity of the downgrade and the reasons cited, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.

Considering the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, with some models emphasizing bearish outlooks due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, and others pointing to the overall market rally and tech sector strength, a cautious stance is warranted. The majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher likelihood of the stock price falling, driven by concerns about Apple's performance and valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company. However, considering the varied predictions from other models and the mixed sentiment expressed, it's essential to weigh both positive and negative factors.
