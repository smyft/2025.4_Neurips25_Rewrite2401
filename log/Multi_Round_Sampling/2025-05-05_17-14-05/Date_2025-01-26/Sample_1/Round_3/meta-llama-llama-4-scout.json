(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's ongoing support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs amidst a political climate where many companies are retracting their DEI efforts. As Apple stands firm in its position and prepares for a shareholder vote, this could resonate positively with investors who favor socially responsible governance. The broader context of the market sees mixed reactions to DEI policies, but since Apple is perceived as a leader in corporate responsibility, this could bolster investor confidence. However, the volatile environment surrounding DEI policies means there is also a risk of backlash, which affects the stock price probabilities. Given that Apple is maintaining its stance, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The article suggests caution due to potential headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article refers to the company being in a precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market. Analyst estimates have also been revised downwards. However, the article also mentions some positive expectations from Q1 earnings print, analysts expect EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. The article suggests that there's potential for both upward and downward movement but considering the potential headwinds, analyst views, and previous quarterly reports, a decrease in stock price is more likely than an increase. The overall economic and broader market context, including the Fed's decisions and PCE data, will also affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance, particularly in tech, fueled by Trump's AI investment announcement and easing tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, several negative factors exist. The upcoming Fed meeting and subsequent Powell's comments could introduce market volatility, potentially impacting Apple negatively depending on the Fed's tone regarding interest rates and inflation.  Further, the overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) could also negatively influence the market sentiment, especially if they fall below expectations, thereby impacting Apple's stock price. The potential for a broader market correction due to overreliance on big tech earnings also presents a risk. While the overall market trend is positive and Apple is well-positioned within that trend, significant uncertainty stems from external macroeconomic factors and the potential for the market to overreact to the Fed's announcement or disappointing economic data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in the corporate sector, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's stance against such initiatives. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies defending its DEI stance, with an upcoming shareholder vote on a proposal to assess risks of its DEI programs. The article highlights that while some companies are retreating from DEI policies, others like Apple, Costco, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs are holding firm. Given Apple's strong brand, market position, and historical resilience to political and social controversies, the news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on its stock price. However, the polarized nature of DEI debates could introduce some volatility. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to investor confidence in Apple's consistent stance and non-political approach.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Jefferies to Underperform with a $200.75 price target due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook. The downgrade implies a 13% downside, suggesting that the analyst expects the stock price to fall. This negative analyst comment is likely to impact investor sentiment and increase the likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies standing firm on their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite the new Trump era and increasing scrutiny. Apple, along with Costco and some big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, is defending its DEI stance. This shows that Apple is committed to its values and is not backing down due to political pressure. This commitment to DEI policies can be seen as a positive factor for the company's reputation and may attract investors who value diversity and social responsibility. However, the article also mentions that many prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies, which could potentially create uncertainty and negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive tone of the article regarding Apple's stance on DEI and the potential long-term benefits of such policies, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong commitment to its DEI policies despite a broader backlash from many companies in the current political climate. Maintaining a clear stance on social responsibility may attract investors who value corporate ethics, which can positively influence stock sentiment. However, the environment is mixed. Some analysts suggest concerns over slowing iPhone sales and recent downgrades, which could weigh negatively on the stock. Overall, the prevailing narrative of Apple standing firm on its principles, alongside potential risks from external factors like economic data and regulatory pressures, leads me to predict a slightly higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. It explicitly recommends approaching the stock with caution, citing headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. This is a significant negative signal. The article highlights the upcoming earnings report as a key event, noting analyst concerns about waning iPhone demand, slower AI adoption, and potentially disappointing guidance. The expected options market move is 4.6% up or down. Additionally, several analysts have lowered revenue forecasts. While earnings per share are expected to be positive, the underlying concerns lean bearish. Despite the company being overvalued, the investingPro Financial Health score further emphasizes slowing profit and sales growth. Also others' beliefs seem to indicate a higher chance of the stock price going down. Therefore, taking all these factors into account the probability of the stock falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for AAPL's stock price movement.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance, boosted by Trump's AI investment and reduced tariff fears; Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is highly anticipated and could drive significant upward movement if strong; and the general positive sentiment toward tech stocks.  Conversely, negative factors exist: the upcoming Fed meeting and Powell's comments have the potential to introduce volatility; the economic data releases (GDP, inflation) could negatively influence market sentiment; and a broader market correction driven by overreliance on big tech earnings is possible.  Previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise.  Considering the multitude of influential factors, the balance tilts slightly toward a price rise due to the strong overall market conditions and the potential for a positive earnings surprise. However, the macroeconomic uncertainty warrants caution, making the probability of a rise not significantly higher than a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) firm stance on maintaining its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs amidst a political climate where many companies are retracting such initiatives. Apple's commitment to DEI could resonate positively with socially-conscious investors and employees, potentially bolstering investor confidence. However, the article also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, which introduces risks for companies like Apple. Given Apple's strong market position and historical resilience to controversies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the polarized nature of DEI debates could introduce volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices. Among previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions. Some models predict a higher probability of stock price rise while others predict a higher probability of stock price fall due to various factors including DEI debates, iPhone sales, and broader economic uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The current news reflects Apple's strong commitment to its DEI policies, contrasting with a general trend of other companies retracting from such initiatives in response to political pressures. This steadfastness may appeal to socially-conscious investors and enhance Apple's reputation, potentially leading to positive stock sentiment. However, concerns about declining iPhone sales, recent analyst downgrades, and macroeconomic uncertainties weigh heavily on expectations. While the corporate sustainability stance is a favorable factor, the overall mixed outlook suggests that the market might react cautiously. Therefore, the probabilities for the stock price show a slightly higher chance of rise due to Apple's strong brand loyalty and commitment compared to the potential for decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a rather negative outlook for Apple. The recommendation is to approach the stock with caution due to slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation. There are concerns about waning iPhone demand, slower AI adoption, and potentially disappointing guidance. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the InvestingPro Financial Health score indicates slowing profit and sales growth. The options market expects a move of about 4.6% up or down. While positive EPS is expected, the underlying concerns lean bearish. Considering the multiple rounds of predictions from others indicating significant headwinds and overvaluation, this strongly suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, I adjust the probabilities accordingly, giving more weight to a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance, particularly in tech, driven by Trump's AI investment and easing tariff concerns; Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is highly anticipated and could significantly boost the stock price if strong; and generally positive sentiment towards tech stocks.  However, negative factors include the upcoming Fed meeting and Powell's comments, which could introduce market volatility; the release of economic data (GDP, inflation), which could negatively influence market sentiment if below expectations; and the possibility of a broader market correction due to overreliance on big tech earnings.  The previous predictions are highly varied, suggesting significant uncertainty. While the potential positive impact of strong earnings is substantial, the macroeconomic uncertainties and the possibility of negative reactions to the Fed's actions or economic data make a neutral stance slightly more likely. The diverse range of previous predictions strengthens this neutral assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) firm stance on maintaining its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting with the broader trend of many companies retracting such initiatives. Apple's commitment to DEI could resonate positively with socially-conscious investors and employees, potentially bolstering investor confidence. However, the article also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, which introduces risks for companies like Apple. Given Apple's strong market position and historical resilience to controversies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the polarized nature of DEI debates could introduce volatility. Previous predictions from other models show mixed opinions, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise, reflecting the uncertainty. Considering Apple's consistent stance and non-political approach, the likelihood of a stock price rise is marginally higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided financial news reports that Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook. This downgrade implies a 13% downside, suggesting that the analyst expects the stock price to fall. Considering the negative analyst comment and the potential headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising. However, Apple's strong brand, market position, and historical resilience to controversies could mitigate the downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with the company defending its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) stance amidst a broader backlash from many companies. This commitment to DEI may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees, potentially bolstering investor confidence. However, increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs introduces risks. Considering Apple's strong market position, historical resilience to controversies, and the potential long-term benefits of DEI policies, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated. Previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, but the overall trend suggests a slightly higher probability of stock price rise due to Apple's strong brand and commitment to social responsibility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) commitment to maintaining its DEI programs amidst a broader trend of companies retracting from such initiatives.
