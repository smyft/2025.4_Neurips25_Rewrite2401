(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

As Apple stands firm in its position and prepares for a shareholder vote, this could resonate positively with investors who favor socially responsible governance. The broader context of the market sees mixed reactions to DEI policies, but since Apple is perceived as a leader in corporate responsibility, this could bolster investor confidence. However, the volatile environment surrounding DEI policies means there is also a risk of backlash, which affects the stock price probabilities. Given that Apple is maintaining its stance, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The article suggests caution due to potential headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article refers to the company being in a precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market. Analyst estimates have also been revised downwards. However, the article also mentions some positive expectations from Q1 earnings print, analysts expect EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. The article suggests that there's potential for both upward and downward movement but considering the potential headwinds, analyst views, and previous quarterly reports, a decrease in stock price is more likely than an increase. The overall economic and broader market context, including the Fed's decisions and PCE data, will also affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance, particularly in tech, fueled by Trump's AI investment announcement and easing tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, several negative factors exist. The upcoming Fed meeting and subsequent Powell's comments could introduce market volatility, potentially impacting Apple negatively depending on the Fed's tone regarding interest rates and inflation.  Further, the overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) could also negatively influence the market sentiment, especially if they fall below expectations, thereby impacting Apple's stock price. The potential for a broader market correction due to overreliance on big tech earnings also presents a risk. While the overall market trend is positive and Apple is well-positioned within that trend, significant uncertainty stems from external macroeconomic factors and the potential for the market to overreact to the Fed's announcement or disappointing economic data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in the corporate sector, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's stance against such initiatives. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies defending its DEI stance, with an upcoming shareholder vote on a proposal to assess risks of its DEI programs. The article highlights that while some companies are retreating from DEI policies, others like Apple, Costco, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs are holding firm. Given Apple's strong brand, market position, and historical resilience to political and social controversies, the news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on its stock price. However, the polarized nature of DEI debates could introduce some volatility. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to investor confidence in Apple's consistent stance and non-political approach.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Jefferies to Underperform with a $200.75 price target due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook. The downgrade implies a 13% downside, suggesting that the analyst expects the stock price to fall. This negative analyst comment is likely to impact investor sentiment and increase the likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies standing firm on their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite the new Trump era and increasing scrutiny. Apple, along with Costco and some big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, is defending its DEI stance. This shows that Apple is committed to its values and is not backing down due to political pressure. This commitment to DEI policies can be seen as a positive factor for the company's reputation and may attract investors who value diversity and social responsibility. However, the article also mentions that many prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies, which could potentially create uncertainty and negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive tone of the article regarding Apple's stance on DEI and the potential long-term benefits of such policies, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
