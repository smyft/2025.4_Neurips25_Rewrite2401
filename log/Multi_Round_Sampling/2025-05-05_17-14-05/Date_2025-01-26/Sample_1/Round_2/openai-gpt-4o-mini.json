(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era\nNews Content: Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

As Apple stands firm in its position and prepares for a shareholder vote, this could resonate positively with investors who favor socially responsible governance. The broader context of the market sees mixed reactions to DEI policies, but since Apple is perceived as a leader in corporate responsibility, this could bolster investor confidence. However, the volatile environment surrounding DEI policies means there is also a risk of backlash, which affects the stock price probabilities. Given that Apple is maintaining its stance, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). The article suggests caution due to potential headwinds such as slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. The article refers to the company being in a precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market. Analyst estimates have also been revised downwards. However, the article also mentions some positive expectations from Q1 earnings print, analysts expect EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion. The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. The article suggests that there's potential for both upward and downward movement but considering the potential headwinds, analyst views, and previous quarterly reports, a decrease in stock price is more likely than an increase. The overall economic and broader market context, including the Fed's decisions and PCE data, will also affect the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance, particularly in tech, fueled by Trump's AI investment announcement and easing tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, several negative factors exist. The upcoming Fed meeting and subsequent Powell's comments could introduce market volatility, potentially impacting Apple negatively depending on the Fed's tone regarding interest rates and inflation.  Further, the overall economic data releases (GDP, inflation) could also negatively influence the market sentiment, especially if they fall below expectations, thereby impacting Apple's stock price. The potential for a broader market correction due to overreliance on big tech earnings also presents a risk. While the overall market trend is positive and Apple is well-positioned within that trend, significant uncertainty stems from external macroeconomic factors and the potential for the market to overreact to the Fed's announcement or disappointing economic data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies in the corporate sector, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's stance against such initiatives. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as one of the companies defending its DEI stance, with an upcoming shareholder vote on a proposal to assess risks of its DEI programs. The article highlights that while some companies are retreating from DEI policies, others like Apple, Costco, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs are holding firm. Given Apple's strong brand, market position, and historical resilience to political and social controversies, the news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on its stock price. However, the polarized nature of DEI debates could introduce some volatility. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher due to investor confidence in Apple's consistent stance and non-political approach.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Jefferies to Underperform with a $200.75 price target due to weak iPhone sales and a subdued AI outlook. The downgrade implies a 13% downside, suggesting that the analyst expects the stock price to fall. This negative analyst comment is likely to impact investor sentiment and increase the likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses companies standing firm on their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies despite the new Trump era and increasing scrutiny. Apple, along with Costco and some big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, is defending its DEI stance. This shows that Apple is committed to its values and is not backing down due to political pressure. This commitment to DEI policies can be seen as a positive factor for the company's reputation and may attract investors who value diversity and social responsibility. However, the article also mentions that many prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies, which could potentially create uncertainty and negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering the overall positive tone of the article regarding Apple's stance on DEI and the potential long-term benefits of such policies, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s stance on maintaining its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, contrasting against the broader trend of many companies retreating from such initiatives. Apple's commitment may appeal to socially-conscious investors and employees. However, the news also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, potentially introducing risks for companies like Apple advocating these practices.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong commitment to its DEI policies despite a broader backlash from many companies in the current political climate. Maintaining a clear stance on social responsibility may attract investors who value corporate ethics, which can positively influence stock sentiment. However, the environment is mixed. Some analysts suggest concerns over slowing iPhone sales and recent downgrades, which could weigh negatively on the stock. Overall, the prevailing narrative of Apple standing firm on its principles, alongside potential risks from external factors like economic data and regulatory pressures, leads me to predict a slightly higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. It explicitly recommends approaching the stock with caution, citing headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. This is a significant negative signal. The article highlights the upcoming earnings report as a key event, noting analyst concerns about waning iPhone demand, slower AI adoption, and potentially disappointing guidance. The expected options market move is 4.6% up or down. Additionally, several analysts have lowered revenue forecasts. While earnings per share are expected to be positive, the underlying concerns lean bearish. Despite the company being overvalued, the investingPro Financial Health score further emphasizes slowing profit and sales growth. Also others' beliefs seem to indicate a higher chance of the stock price going down. Therefore, taking all these factors into account the probability of the stock falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a complex picture for AAPL's stock price movement.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance, boosted by Trump's AI investment and reduced tariff fears; Apple's upcoming earnings report, which is highly anticipated and could drive significant upward movement if strong; and the general positive sentiment toward tech stocks.  Conversely, negative factors exist: the upcoming Fed meeting and Powell's comments have the potential to introduce volatility; the economic data releases (GDP, inflation) could negatively influence market sentiment; and a broader market correction driven by overreliance on big tech earnings is possible.  Previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise.  Considering the multitude of influential factors, the balance tilts slightly toward a price rise due to the strong overall market conditions and the potential for a positive earnings surprise. However, the macroeconomic uncertainty warrants caution, making the probability of a rise not significantly higher than a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) firm stance on maintaining its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs amidst a political climate where many companies are retracting such initiatives. Apple's commitment to DEI could resonate positively with socially-conscious investors and employees, potentially bolstering investor confidence. However, the article also highlights increasing regulatory and political pressure against DEI programs, which introduces risks for companies like Apple. Given Apple's strong market position and historical resilience to controversies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the polarized nature of DEI debates could introduce volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
