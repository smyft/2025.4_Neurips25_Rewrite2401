(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and diminished innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts, and the stock is testing its 200-day moving average after a notable decline. Given the cautious sentiment expressed and the anticipation of disappointing earnings guidance, the probability of the stock price falling appears higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While Warren Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway still holds a large stake, they have significantly reduced their position, citing overvaluation relative to growth. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and relatively slow free cash flow growth (excluding buy backs), which are negative factors. However, Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services revenue are positive. The 'not a buy' recommendation in the article title and overall tone further suggests downward pressure. While Buffett's continued holding provides some support, the stated reasons for selling more than half of his stake leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decrease in the near term, especially with a potential market downturn looming in the author's opinion. Note that there is an advertisement for 'Double Down' stocks within the article, which may bias the reader into feeling like Apple is a poor buy, which is also considered in this probability.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates. While the overall market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data) are mentioned as potentially impactful, the article's focus is primarily on company-specific factors.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted heavily towards the individual company assessments presented in the article. The probability of a price fall for AAPL is significantly higher than a price rise based on the negative sentiment expressed.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) Positive market sentiment due to the S&P 500's strong performance and a rally in tech stocks, 2) Upcoming earnings report from Apple, which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks expected to show strong earnings growth, 3) A favorable environment for tech stocks due to the AI investment announcement by Trump, 4) The Federal Reserve's expected decision to hold interest rates steady, which generally supports tech stocks. However, there is some uncertainty around the Fed's commentary and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility. Overall, the positive factors outweigh the potential negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) through Berkshire Hathaway, but also highlights that Buffett has been reducing his stake in the company. The article suggests that while Apple's service segment is growing, the company's valuation is stretched, and its recent performance has been lackluster with stagnant sales and profits. The analyst concludes that it is not a good time to buy Apple stock due to its high valuation and decelerating earnings growth. However, the article also mentions Apple's potential for steady dividend payments and growing service sales. Based on this mixed analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.4 and falling as 0.6.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of several major tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), as well as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The article also mentions the recent rally in the stock market, led by tech stocks, and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the market. Given the strong earnings growth expected from the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple, and the overall positive market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's valuation, rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the article cautions against purchasing the stock given its current valuation and perceived underperformance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
