      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's ongoing support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs amidst a political climate where many companies are retracting their DEI efforts. As Apple stands firm in its position and prepares for a shareholder vote, this could resonate positively with investors who favor socially responsible governance. The broader context of the market sees mixed reactions to DEI policies, but since Apple is perceived as a leader in corporate responsibility, this could bolster investor confidence. However, the volatile environment surrounding DEI policies means there is also a risk of backlash, which affects the stock price probabilities. Given that Apple is maintaining its stance, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust sold some Apple stock because it became too large a part of their portfolio. This action, coupled with Cramer's statement predicting a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades, signals a short-term negative outlook. While the article acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment suggests downward pressure. Cramer's comments will likely influence other investors. Also other AI contenders are being touted above AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a shift among some companies to scale back these programs.  Apple's steadfast stance, mirroring that of other large companies like Costco and JPMorgan Chase, suggests resilience and a belief that DEI remains important for their business model and brand image. This position is likely viewed positively by a segment of investors who value ESG (environmental, social, and governance) factors.  However, the ongoing legal and political challenges to DEI initiatives introduce uncertainty, potentially impacting investor confidence.  While Apple's position might be viewed favorably by some, the overall impact on stock price is likely to be muted due to the larger economic and market factors at play.  The news itself doesn't provide strong indicators for significant price movement in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio. Cramer also predicts that Apple will miss its quarterly earnings and anticipates potential downgrades from analysts ahead of the earnings report. This negative sentiment, especially from a well-known financial commentator, could influence investor behavior. However, Apple's strong market position and long-term growth potential might mitigate some of the immediate negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a price decline is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mix of factors that could influence Apple's stock price. The company's earnings report is upcoming, and with the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates and comments from Chair Jay Powell, there could be significant market movement. Additionally, the overall market sentiment seems positive with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average showing gains in the previous week. However, the market is also awaiting the Fed's decision on interest rates and the earnings reports from major tech companies, which could impact Apple's stock price. Considering that Apple's earnings report is expected to show growth and that the overall tech sector has been performing well, there's a likelihood of a positive stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights Apple's rich valuation, with a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 31.7, and its recent revenue growth of only 1.3% over the past three years. Although Apple's service sales are growing, the article concludes that buying the stock now may not be a good idea due to its high valuation and stagnant sales and profits. However, the article also mentions that Apple's steadily growing dividend payments and high-margin service sales could support long-term earnings growth. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's valuation, rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the article cautions against purchasing the stock given its current valuation and perceived underperformance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's commitment to maintaining its DEI programs amidst a backdrop of political resistance signals a strong stance on corporate responsibility, which can resonate positively with socially conscious investors. However, there are mixed reactions in the market due to backlash and legal scrutiny surrounding DEI initiatives. While Apple is expected to perform well long-term, immediate influences from financial commentators and market sentiment regarding valuations may counterbalance the positive outlook. Given these dynamics, I predict a moderate chance of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The primary driver of potential stock movement in this news is Jim Cramer's comments. He explicitly states that his charitable trust sold some AAPL stock because it became too large of a part of their portfolio, and he predicts that AAPL will miss its next quarter. He also anticipates analyst downgrades before the earnings report. While the article notes Apple's longer-term potential, Cramer's short-term outlook is explicitly negative, which is likely to influence investor sentiment, especially given his popular following. The previous analyst prediction trend leaned towards a negative or cautiously neutral outlook for Apple. Considering all these factors, I believe that the stock is likely to experience a decrease in price. I also note that while positive information such as DEI commitment was brought up in the other rounds of predictions, it is less impactful than earnings forecast related information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives, contrasting with many companies scaling back due to political pressure.  Apple's decision to oppose a shareholder proposal targeting its DEI programs suggests confidence in its approach. While this might resonate positively with ESG-focused investors, the overall impact is likely muted. The news doesn't directly address Apple's financial performance or other market factors that significantly influence stock price.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price increase due to the positive aspects of Apple's stance on DEI, while others show a higher likelihood of price decrease due to other factors not directly related to this news (e.g., Cramer's actions and other market conditions). Considering the limited direct impact of this news on Apple's financials and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price increase and decrease. The previous rounds' predictions also show a wide range of probabilities, suggesting significant uncertainty surrounding the stock's short-term future and reinforcing the conclusion of a relatively even probability distribution. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio.

Given the mixed signals, the probability of a price decline is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s actions contrast with those of many others who are retreating from DEI commitments, potentially positioning Apple as a leader in corporate responsibility. However, significant negative sentiment stemming from Jim Cramer\u2019s comments regarding potential earnings misses and analyst downgrades, coupled with concerns about overvaluation, create uncertainty. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a slight likelihood of stock price increase due to the positive aspects of Apple's DEI stance being overshadowed by the immediate negative concerns highlighted by market analysts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple, stating he sold some stock because it was too big of a portfolio holding and expects a disappointing quarter with potential analyst downgrades. This directly contrasts with the positive DEI outlook which is a long term benefit, therefore i'm focusing more on the short term negative outlook. The other AI stocks mentioned are not the focus and only mentioned incidentally. Previous models also trended to favor a price decrease because of Cramer's negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a decrease is quite high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's continued support for DEI initiatives, contrasting with the trend of many companies scaling back.  While this positive stance might resonate with some investors, it's unlikely to be a major driver of stock price movement. The previous predictions highlight a significant divergence of opinion; some emphasize the positive impact of Apple's firm DEI commitment, others point to negative signals such as Jim Cramer's reported selling and predicted earnings miss.  The lack of direct impact on Apple's financials in this news piece coupled with the mixed and conflicting signals from previous predictions suggest an overall neutral outlook for short term price movement.  The weight of evidence leans slightly towards a higher probability of the price falling given the previous prediction rounds' overall negative bias, with additional concerns about potential earnings misses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio. Cramer also predicts that Apple will miss its quarterly earnings and anticipates potential downgrades from analysts ahead of the earnings report. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial commentator is likely to influence investor behavior. While Apple's strong market position and long-term growth potential might mitigate some of the immediate negative impact, the short-term outlook appears bearish. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news, the probability of a price decline is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights Apple's rich valuation, with a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 31.7, and its recent revenue growth of only 1.3% over the past three years.

However, the overall market environment is challenging, particularly due to negative comments from prominent financial commentators like Jim Cramer, who express concerns about potential earnings misses and analyst downgrades. These factors create a mixed sentiment surrounding the stock. The emphasis on DEI as a leadership quality might appeal to some investors, but it is overshadowed by immediate financial concerns and the possibility of negative market reactions. Given this context, I estimate a slight probability of the stock price rising but a higher probability of it falling due to prevailing negative sentiments and concerns over valuation and earnings performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.28, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.72, Reasoning: The dominant factor influencing the stock price appears to be Jim Cramer's commentary. He sold shares due to portfolio size concerns and anticipates a disappointing quarter with potential analyst downgrades, creating negative sentiment. While Apple's DEI stance offers some positive long-term value, the immediate financial concerns raised by Cramer are likely to have a more significant short-term impact. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend toward a greater probability of price decrease. Therefore, my prediction leans towards a price decrease. In addition, note that four prediction models produced the same result over the past three rounds - which likely indicates a consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives, contrasting with the retreat of other companies, could be viewed positively by some investors, particularly those focused on ESG factors.  However, this positive sentiment is significantly overshadowed by the consistently negative predictions from previous models. These predictions heavily weigh the impact of Jim Cramer selling Apple stock due to overexposure in his portfolio, anticipation of an earnings miss, and analyst downgrades.  These negative factors point to a short-term bearish outlook. While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the immediate pressures appear to outweigh any potential short-term benefit from the company's DEI stance.  The consensus among the prior predictions heavily leans towards a price decrease, and I find that conclusion convincing given the weight of evidence.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to its large portfolio share and his prediction of a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades. This negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator could influence investor behavior negatively in the short term. However, Apple's strong market position and long-term growth potential might mitigate some of the immediate impact. Previous predictions from various models show a trend towards a higher probability of stock price fall due to the negative outlook, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 for a fall. Considering the mixed signals but leaning towards the negative sentiment from Cramer's comments, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, and the overall market sentiment. Despite a positive stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which might appeal to socially conscious investors, there are significant concerns. Jim Cramer's prediction of a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades for Apple creates negative sentiment. Additionally, the stock's high valuation and slowing revenue growth are noted. Considering these mixed signals, with a focus on the short-term impact of earnings expectations and market sentiment, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.

Considering these mixed signals, with a focus on the short-term impact of earnings expectations and market sentiment, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.38,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.62\n}\n```"
