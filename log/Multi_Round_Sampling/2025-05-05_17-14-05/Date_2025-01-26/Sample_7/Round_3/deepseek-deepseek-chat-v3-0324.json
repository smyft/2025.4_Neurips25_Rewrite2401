(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's ongoing support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs amidst a political climate where many companies are retracting their DEI efforts. As Apple stands firm in its position and prepares for a shareholder vote, this could resonate positively with investors who favor socially responsible governance. The broader context of the market sees mixed reactions to DEI policies, but since Apple is perceived as a leader in corporate responsibility, this could bolster investor confidence. However, the volatile environment surrounding DEI policies means there is also a risk of backlash, which affects the stock price probabilities. Given that Apple is maintaining its stance, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline directly states that Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust sold some Apple stock because it became too large a part of their portfolio. This action, coupled with Cramer's statement predicting a potential earnings miss and analyst downgrades, signals a short-term negative outlook. While the article acknowledges AAPL's long-term potential, the immediate sentiment suggests downward pressure. Cramer's comments will likely influence other investors. Also other AI contenders are being touted above AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's continued commitment to DEI initiatives, despite increasing pressure from conservative groups and a shift among some companies to scale back these programs.  Apple's steadfast stance, mirroring that of other large companies like Costco and JPMorgan Chase, suggests resilience and a belief that DEI remains important for their business model and brand image. This position is likely viewed positively by a segment of investors who value ESG (environmental, social, and governance) factors.  However, the ongoing legal and political challenges to DEI initiatives introduce uncertainty, potentially impacting investor confidence.  While Apple's position might be viewed favorably by some, the overall impact on stock price is likely to be muted due to the larger economic and market factors at play.  The news itself doesn't provide strong indicators for significant price movement in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio. Cramer also predicts that Apple will miss its quarterly earnings and anticipates potential downgrades from analysts ahead of the earnings report. This negative sentiment, especially from a well-known financial commentator, could influence investor behavior. However, Apple's strong market position and long-term growth potential might mitigate some of the immediate negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a price decline is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news provides a mix of factors that could influence Apple's stock price. The company's earnings report is upcoming, and with the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates and comments from Chair Jay Powell, there could be significant market movement. Additionally, the overall market sentiment seems positive with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average showing gains in the previous week. However, the market is also awaiting the Fed's decision on interest rates and the earnings reports from major tech companies, which could impact Apple's stock price. Considering that Apple's earnings report is expected to show growth and that the overall tech sector has been performing well, there's a likelihood of a positive stock price movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and analyzes whether it's a good time to buy the stock. The article highlights Apple's rich valuation, with a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 31.7, and its recent revenue growth of only 1.3% over the past three years. Although Apple's service sales are growing, the article concludes that buying the stock now may not be a good idea due to its high valuation and stagnant sales and profits. However, the article also mentions that Apple's steadily growing dividend payments and high-margin service sales could support long-term earnings growth. Considering these factors, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett, known for his strategic investment choices, retains a significant stake in Apple despite reducing his holdings. On the other hand, the article suggests that Apple's stock is overvalued relative to its recent financial performance, as evidenced by the slowing growth in both revenue and free cash flow. Additionally, the news indicates that further reduction in Apple's stake is partly due to the stock's valuation, rather than concerns about the underlying business. While Apple's services segment shows promising growth, the article cautions against purchasing the stock given its current valuation and perceived underperformance.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's commitment to maintaining its DEI programs amidst a backdrop of political resistance signals a strong stance on corporate responsibility, which can resonate positively with socially conscious investors. However, there are mixed reactions in the market due to backlash and legal scrutiny surrounding DEI initiatives. While Apple is expected to perform well long-term, immediate influences from financial commentators and market sentiment regarding valuations may counterbalance the positive outlook. Given these dynamics, I predict a moderate chance of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The primary driver of potential stock movement in this news is Jim Cramer's comments. He explicitly states that his charitable trust sold some AAPL stock because it became too large of a part of their portfolio, and he predicts that AAPL will miss its next quarter. He also anticipates analyst downgrades before the earnings report. While the article notes Apple's longer-term potential, Cramer's short-term outlook is explicitly negative, which is likely to influence investor sentiment, especially given his popular following. The previous analyst prediction trend leaned towards a negative or cautiously neutral outlook for Apple. Considering all these factors, I believe that the stock is likely to experience a decrease in price. I also note that while positive information such as DEI commitment was brought up in the other rounds of predictions, it is less impactful than earnings forecast related information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's steadfast commitment to DEI initiatives, contrasting with many companies scaling back due to political pressure.  Apple's decision to oppose a shareholder proposal targeting its DEI programs suggests confidence in its approach. While this might resonate positively with ESG-focused investors, the overall impact is likely muted. The news doesn't directly address Apple's financial performance or other market factors that significantly influence stock price.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price increase due to the positive aspects of Apple's stance on DEI, while others show a higher likelihood of price decrease due to other factors not directly related to this news (e.g., Cramer's actions and other market conditions). Considering the limited direct impact of this news on Apple's financials and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price increase and decrease. The previous rounds' predictions also show a wide range of probabilities, suggesting significant uncertainty surrounding the stock's short-term future and reinforcing the conclusion of a relatively even probability distribution. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio.

This negative sentiment, especially from a well-known financial commentator, could influence investor behavior. However, Apple's strong market position and long-term growth potential might mitigate some of the immediate negative impact. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a price decline is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s actions contrast with those of many others who are retreating from DEI commitments, potentially positioning Apple as a leader in corporate responsibility. However, significant negative sentiment stemming from Jim Cramer\u2019s comments regarding potential earnings misses and analyst downgrades, coupled with concerns about overvaluation, create uncertainty. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a slight likelihood of stock price increase due to the positive aspects of Apple's DEI stance being overshadowed by the immediate negative concerns highlighted by market analysts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple, stating he sold some stock because it was too big of a portfolio holding and expects a disappointing quarter with potential analyst downgrades. This directly contrasts with the positive DEI outlook which is a long term benefit, therefore i'm focusing more on the short term negative outlook. The other AI stocks mentioned are not the focus and only mentioned incidentally. Previous models also trended to favor a price decrease because of Cramer's negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a decrease is quite high.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's continued support for DEI initiatives, contrasting with the trend of many companies scaling back.  While this positive stance might resonate with some investors, it's unlikely to be a major driver of stock price movement. The previous predictions highlight a significant divergence of opinion; some emphasize the positive impact of Apple's firm DEI commitment, others point to negative signals such as Jim Cramer's reported selling and predicted earnings miss.  The lack of direct impact on Apple's financials in this news piece coupled with the mixed and conflicting signals from previous predictions suggest an overall neutral outlook for short term price movement.  The weight of evidence leans slightly towards a higher probability of the price falling given the previous prediction rounds' overall negative bias, with additional concerns about potential earnings misses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc.

This negative sentiment from a well-known financial commentator is likely to influence investor behavior. While Apple's strong market position and long-term growth potential might mitigate some of the immediate negative impact, the short-term outlook appears bearish. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news, the probability of a price decline is slightly higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
