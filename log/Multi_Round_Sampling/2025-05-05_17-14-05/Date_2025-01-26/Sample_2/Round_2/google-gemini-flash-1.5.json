      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week\nNews Content: The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns for Apple, particularly around slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Additionally, market analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising, especially considering the sentiment expressed in the news. The options market predicts a price movement of around 4.6%, indicating increased volatility. Therefore, the probability of a price drop is estimated to be higher than that of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his endorsement can signal confidence in a company's long-term value. This can lead to increased investor interest and buying pressure. However, the headline is phrased as a question (\"Is It a Buy Now?\"), implying that there are also factors to consider beyond Buffett's investment. Also since this news only reasserts a priorly-known investment, the price fluctuations will likely be based on whether investors will follow Buffett's suit and buy into AAPL. Due to the uncertainty the headline infers, the effect on price would likely not be significant. I'll adjust with a slight higher probability for stock price increase in reflection to the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance, particularly in tech, fueled by Trump's AI investment announcement and easing tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, the upcoming Fed meeting and economic data releases introduce uncertainty; the Fed's actions and comments on inflation could negatively impact the market broadly, affecting Apple. The overall economic data, particularly GDP and inflation figures, could also sway investor sentiment. Since Apple's earnings represent a significant portion of the news cycle, it is likely that the market response will be heavily influenced by those results. A positive surprise could significantly increase the probability of a price rise, while a negative surprise could dramatically shift the probabilities toward a fall. Given the complex interplay of factors, a neutral starting point is reasonable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too large a part of his portfolio, and his prediction that the company will miss its upcoming quarter results. Cramer also mentions potential downgrades by analysts ahead of the earnings report, which could lead to selling pressure. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term growth potential, his short-term outlook is bearish. This negative sentiment from a influential financial personality like Cramer could influence investor behavior, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., indicating a vote of confidence from a renowned investor. Historically, news of high-profile investments by influential figures like Buffett can positively impact stock prices due to increased investor confidence and potential buying activity. However, it's also worth noting that the market may already have priced in this information, and the article does not reveal new or particularly surprising information about Apple's fundamentals. Thus, the impact might be muted. Considering these factors, there's a higher probability that the stock price will rise due to the positive sentiment generated by Buffett's endorsement, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. highlights significant challenges, particularly with slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Several analysts have cut their revenue forecasts, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. The options market indicates an expected movement of about 4.6%, suggesting increased volatility. Given the mixed sentiment from notable figures like Warren Buffett and Jim Cramer, but ultimately the overall bearish outlook due to weak demand signals and forecast downgrades, this results in a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which generally signals confidence in the company. While the headline asks \"Is it a buy now?\", suggesting potential caveats, the overall tone leans positive. Considering the previous rounds, there is a divergence of opinions, with a mix of bullish and bearish predictions. The fact this headline simply restates an existing investment suggests the information should be largely priced in and might suggest only moderate shifts. Factoring in the lack of substantially new information, the positive sentiment with Warren buffet makes me slightly bullish; however, the risk/reward of Buffett already being in the stock suggests that the increase will be moderate if any. Therefore, I predict the price is slightly more likely to rise due to the Buffett association, although the impact will likely be moderate since this is pre-existing information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance, particularly in tech, driven by Trump's AI investment and reduced tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is crucial, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, several counterpoints exist: the upcoming Fed meeting and economic data could negatively impact the market broadly, affecting Apple.  The economic data, especially GDP and inflation, will also influence investor sentiment.  The previous predictions are quite varied, reflecting the uncertainty. Some highlight the potential for disappointment in earnings, while others emphasize the positive impact of the general market and Trump's policies. Given the significant earnings announcement, market reaction heavily depends on those results. A positive surprise would dramatically increase the probability of a rise, while negative results would shift probabilities towards a fall. Considering this mix of positive and negative influences, and the uncertainty inherent in predicting short-term stock movements, a probability slightly favoring a price rise reflects the overall balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bearish short-term outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing concerns over potential earnings misses and analyst downgrades. Cramer's influence as a financial personality could sway investor sentiment negatively. While Apple's long-term growth potential is acknowledged, the immediate reaction to this news is likely to be negative. The majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article does not directly mention Apple's financial performance or product developments, it highlights that Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that would encourage the company to assess risks of its DEI programs. This indicates that Apple is committed to its DEI practices, which could be seen as a positive signal by investors who value diversity and inclusion initiatives. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or mildly positive, as DEI practices are just one of many factors influencing investor decisions. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed outlook, with some indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price increase and others suggesting a decrease. Considering the neutral to positive implications of defending DEI practices and the absence of directly negative news about Apple's financials or operations, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., indicating a vote of confidence from a renowned investor. Historically, news of high-profile investments by influential figures like Buffett can positively impact stock prices due to increased investor confidence and potential buying activity. However, it's also worth noting that the market may already have priced in this information, and the article does not reveal new or particularly surprising information about Apple's fundamentals. Thus, the impact might be muted. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement and others predicting a fall due to various negative factors, a balanced approach is necessary. The overall market sentiment and Apple's long-term growth potential should also be taken into account. Given these factors, there's a moderate probability that the stock price will rise due to the positive sentiment generated by Buffett's endorsement, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio, his concern that Apple will miss its upcoming quarter results, and potential downgrades from other analysts. These factors indicate a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the negative outlook and historical predictions, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
