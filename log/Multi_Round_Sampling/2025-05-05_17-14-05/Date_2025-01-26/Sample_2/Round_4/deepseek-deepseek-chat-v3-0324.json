(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant concerns for Apple, particularly around slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Additionally, market analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising, especially considering the sentiment expressed in the news. The options market predicts a price movement of around 4.6%, indicating increased volatility. Therefore, the probability of a price drop is estimated to be higher than that of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple. Buffett's investment decisions are widely followed, and his endorsement can signal confidence in a company's long-term value. This can lead to increased investor interest and buying pressure. However, the headline is phrased as a question (\"Is It a Buy Now?\"), implying that there are also factors to consider beyond Buffett's investment. Also since this news only reasserts a priorly-known investment, the price fluctuations will likely be based on whether investors will follow Buffett's suit and buy into AAPL. Due to the uncertainty the headline infers, the effect on price would likely not be significant. I'll adjust with a slight higher probability for stock price increase in reflection to the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the overall strong market performance, particularly in tech, fueled by Trump's AI investment announcement and easing tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is highly anticipated, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, the upcoming Fed meeting and economic data releases introduce uncertainty; the Fed's actions and comments on inflation could negatively impact the market broadly, affecting Apple. The overall economic data, particularly GDP and inflation figures, could also sway investor sentiment. Since Apple's earnings represent a significant portion of the news cycle, it is likely that the market response will be heavily influenced by those results. A positive surprise could significantly increase the probability of a price rise, while a negative surprise could dramatically shift the probabilities toward a fall. Given the complex interplay of factors, a neutral starting point is reasonable.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too large a part of his portfolio, and his prediction that the company will miss its upcoming quarter results. Cramer also mentions potential downgrades by analysts ahead of the earnings report, which could lead to selling pressure. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term growth potential, his short-term outlook is bearish. This negative sentiment from a influential financial personality like Cramer could influence investor behavior, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., indicating a vote of confidence from a renowned investor. Historically, news of high-profile investments by influential figures like Buffett can positively impact stock prices due to increased investor confidence and potential buying activity. However, it's also worth noting that the market may already have priced in this information, and the article does not reveal new or particularly surprising information about Apple's fundamentals. Thus, the impact might be muted. Considering these factors, there's a higher probability that the stock price will rise due to the positive sentiment generated by Buffett's endorsement, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. highlights significant challenges, particularly with slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum. Several analysts have cut their revenue forecasts, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to disappoint. The options market indicates an expected movement of about 4.6%, suggesting increased volatility. Given the mixed sentiment from notable figures like Warren Buffett and Jim Cramer, but ultimately the overall bearish outlook due to weak demand signals and forecast downgrades, this results in a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's large investment in Apple, which generally signals confidence in the company. While the headline asks \"Is it a buy now?\", suggesting potential caveats, the overall tone leans positive. Considering the previous rounds, there is a divergence of opinions, with a mix of bullish and bearish predictions. The fact this headline simply restates an existing investment suggests the information should be largely priced in and might suggest only moderate shifts. Factoring in the lack of substantially new information, the positive sentiment with Warren buffet makes me slightly bullish; however, the risk/reward of Buffett already being in the stock suggests that the increase will be moderate if any. Therefore, I predict the price is slightly more likely to rise due to the Buffett association, although the impact will likely be moderate since this is pre-existing information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include the strong overall market performance, particularly in tech, driven by Trump's AI investment and reduced tariff concerns. Apple's earnings report is crucial, and strong results could significantly boost the stock price. However, several counterpoints exist: the upcoming Fed meeting and economic data could negatively impact the market broadly, affecting Apple.  The economic data, especially GDP and inflation, will also influence investor sentiment.  The previous predictions are quite varied, reflecting the uncertainty. Some highlight the potential for disappointment in earnings, while others emphasize the positive impact of the general market and Trump's policies. Given the significant earnings announcement, market reaction heavily depends on those results. A positive surprise would dramatically increase the probability of a rise, while negative results would shift probabilities towards a fall. Considering this mix of positive and negative influences, and the uncertainty inherent in predicting short-term stock movements, a probability slightly favoring a price rise reflects the overall balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's bearish short-term outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), citing concerns over potential earnings misses and analyst downgrades. Cramer's influence as a financial personality could sway investor sentiment negatively. While Apple's long-term growth potential is acknowledged, the immediate reaction to this news is likely to be negative. The majority of previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article does not directly mention Apple's financial performance or product developments, it highlights that Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that would encourage the company to assess risks of its DEI programs. This indicates that Apple is committed to its DEI practices, which could be seen as a positive signal by investors who value diversity and inclusion initiatives. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or mildly positive, as DEI practices are just one of many factors influencing investor decisions. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed outlook, with some indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price increase and others suggesting a decrease. Considering the neutral to positive implications of defending DEI practices and the absence of directly negative news about Apple's financials or operations, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple Inc., indicating a vote of confidence from a renowned investor. Historically, news of high-profile investments by influential figures like Buffett can positively impact stock prices due to increased investor confidence and potential buying activity. However, it's also worth noting that the market may already have priced in this information, and the article does not reveal new or particularly surprising information about Apple's fundamentals. Thus, the impact might be muted. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a higher probability of a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement and others predicting a fall due to various negative factors, a balanced approach is necessary. The overall market sentiment and Apple's long-term growth potential should also be taken into account. Given these factors, there's a moderate probability that the stock price will rise due to the positive sentiment generated by Buffett's endorsement, but the effect may not be dramatic.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio, his concern that Apple will miss its upcoming quarter results, and potential downgrades from other analysts. These factors indicate a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the negative outlook and historical predictions, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. highlights major concerns about slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and downward revisions of revenue forecasts by analysts. The upcoming earnings report is likely to disappoint market expectations, contributing to a bearish sentiment. Despite some positive sentiment stemming from notable investors like Warren Buffett, the overall negative outlook, emphasized by Cramer's comments and the context of the market, leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The options market suggests an expected stock price movement of about 4.6%, indicating significant volatility and uncertainty. Therefore, the likelihood of a price decline is substantially higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in Apple. While it doesn't provide new information (as Buffett's position is well-known), it serves as a reiteration of his confidence in the company. Examining previous predictions, there is a divergence of opinion. Some models are bullish, citing Buffett's endorsement, but acknowledge the information may already be priced in. Others are bearish due to various factors, not directly linked to this news piece but rather to potential earnings misses and analyst downgrades that would cause price pressure regardless of the new information. Given that this news is more of a reaffirmation than a catalyst for significant price movement, and considering the mixed sentiment from others and the already heavily weighed influence Buffett has, I lean slightly towards a price increase due to the continued positive association with Buffett, but reduce the rise to incorporate the market already pricing this in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The upcoming earnings report is a major factor, with the potential for a significant price swing depending on whether results meet or exceed expectations. The strong overall market performance and Trump's AI initiative are positive signals for the tech sector, but the impending Fed decision and economic data releases introduce uncertainty. A rate hike or concerning economic data could negatively impact the market, affecting Apple alongside other stocks.  Previous predictions show considerable divergence, ranging from a strong probability of a price fall to a more moderate view favoring a price rise.  The uncertainty, alongside the significance of the upcoming earnings report, makes a neutral stance difficult. The weight of the earnings report is significant enough to be a strong driver of either a price increase or decrease; however, the overall positive market sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, assuming at least a neutral earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio and his prediction that the company will miss its upcoming quarter results. Cramer also mentions potential downgrades by analysts ahead of the earnings report, which could lead to selling pressure. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's long-term growth potential, his short-term outlook is bearish. This negative sentiment from an influential financial personality like Cramer could influence investor behavior, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term. Previous predictions also predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline, reinforcing the bearish outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the ongoing debate around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that would encourage the company to assess risks of its DEI programs.

However, considering the mixed predictions from other models and the lack of new information in the article, the impact on the stock price might be muted. The overall market sentiment and Apple's long-term growth potential also need to be taken into account. Given the positive sentiment generated by Buffett's endorsement, but also considering the potential for the market to have already priced in this information, a balanced approach is necessary. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than that of falling, but not dramatically so.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too large a part of his portfolio, his concern that Apple will miss its upcoming quarter results, and potential downgrades from other analysts. These factors indicate a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, previous predictions predominantly show a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Therefore, considering the negative outlook and historical predictions, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates significant headwinds for Apple Inc. due to slower iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and lowered revenue forecasts by analysts. The market sentiment is further impacted by Jim Cramer's bearish commentary and mixed predictions from various models. Although there is some positive sentiment from Warren Buffett's prior investment in Apple, the overall outlook is dominated by concerns regarding the upcoming earnings report, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The options market suggests increased volatility with an expected price movement of about 4.6% in either direction. Given the consensus among several analysis models, there is a greater likelihood of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline itself presents a mixed signal. While it highlights Warren Buffett's large investment, implying confidence, the question \"Is It a Buy Now?\" suggests underlying concerns. Most models in previous rounds have leaned towards a bearish outlook, driven by factors like potential earnings misses (highlighted by Jim Cramer), analyst downgrades, and general market volatility. While some models acknowledge the positive influence of Buffett's endorsement, they also recognize this information is likely already priced in. The trend of predictions suggests that the negative perspective of Cramer's commentary is increasing sentiment that the stock will fall. I am swayed to believe that any positive impact from the Buffett headline is likely muted, overshadowed by more pressing concerns around earnings and analyst sentiment. Consequently, the probability of a price fall is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The upcoming earnings report is a major factor, with the potential for a significant price swing depending on results. Positive factors include strong overall market performance, Trump's AI initiative, and reduced tariff concerns.  However, the Fed meeting and economic data releases introduce uncertainty; a rate hike or poor economic data could negatively impact the market, affecting Apple.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty.  Some highlight potential earnings disappointment, while others emphasize positive market impacts and Trump's policies. Jim Cramer's bearish outlook adds to the negative sentiment, although his opinion is just one factor among many.  Warren Buffett's investment is positive but may already be priced in.  Considering the mixed signals and high uncertainty surrounding the earnings announcement, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, slightly leaning towards a price rise given the overall positive market sentiment and potential for strong earnings (though a poor earnings report would likely outweigh the positive factors). The overall market direction will play a significant role independent of Apple's earnings.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content highlight Jim Cramer's decision to sell some Apple Inc.

(AAPL). Apple has asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal that would encourage the company to assess risks of its DEI programs, indicating its commitment to these practices.
