(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Meta Platforms, Apple\nNews Content: \u2022 Fed FOMC Meeting, PCE inflation data, \u2018Big Tech\u2019 earnings will be in focus this week.\n\n\u2022 Meta\u2019s aggressive push into AI, coupled with strong revenue and earnings growth, makes it an appealing stock to buy.\n\n\u2022 Apple faces headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and reduced innovation momentum, making it a stock to approach with caution.\n\n\u2022 Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro!\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.\n\nMarkets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.\n\nBesides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday\u2019s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMeanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging market backdrop.\n\nSubscribe now to get 50% off all Pro plans with our New Year\u2019s holiday sale and instantly unlock access to several market-beating features, including:\n\n\u2022 ProPicks AI: AI-selected stock winners with proven track record.\n\n\u2022 InvestingPro Fair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\n\u2022 Advanced Stock Screener: Search for the best stocks based on hundreds of selected filters, and criteria.\n\n\u2022 Top Ideas: See what stocks billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Michael Burry, and George Soros are buying.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, I am long on the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 via the SPDR\u00ae S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ).

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and diminished innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing results. Additionally, the options market indicates a possible price movement of 4.6%, showing uncertainty. Given this negative outlook and the potential for the stock to fall further from its recent lows, the probability of a price decline is estimated to be higher than that of an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade to Underperform with a significant downside target (13%) based on weak iPhone sales, slow AI uptake and a missed revenue growth target paint a negative picture. This weighs heavily on near-term stock performance. While broader macroeconomic trends and future product releases could influence the stock, the analyst downgrade is likely to cause a decrease in near future price. Since it is negative analyst coverage, I give the stock a 70% chance of going down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates.  While the overall market environment (Fed meeting, inflation data) introduces uncertainty, the article's specific analysis of Apple leans heavily towards a negative short-term outlook for the stock. The probabilities are estimates based on this analysis and the short-term (one week) timeframe specified in the article.  The probability of a price rise for AAPL is low given the negative factors outlined, and the probability of a fall is relatively higher. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. On one hand, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Apple, suggesting concerns about the stock's stretched valuation and stagnant growth in sales and profits. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors. On the other hand, Apple's strong free cash flow, growing services segment, and potential for dividend increases provide some positive outlook. However, the overall tone of the article leans towards caution due to the high valuation and lack of significant growth, which may outweigh the positives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple's stock performance, stating that he sold some of his Apple shares because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He believes Apple's quarterly results will be disappointing and predicts the stock price will go lower. Additionally, he thinks there will be downgrades from analysts ahead of the quarterly report. Historically, Apple's stock has seen significant increases after being downgraded, but in the short term, Cramer's statements could lead to negative sentiment. Based on Cramer's comments, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and thinks it will miss the quarter, potentially leading to a downgrade. However, he also mentions that the stock is a long-term hold and tends to rebound after downgrades. Given this mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the balance of positive and negative comments. The negative comments about potentially missing the quarter and being downgraded suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, while the long-term positive outlook suggests some probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of their portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a potential stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant headwinds for Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly in terms of slowing iPhone sales and concerns over innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, and forthcoming earnings are anticipated to be disappointing, suggesting a negative outlook. The options market reflects an expected price movement of approximately 4.6%, highlighting uncertainty. Additionally, comparisons to the positive sentiment surrounding Meta Platforms (the stock recommended for purchase) further indicate market caution towards Apple. Overall, the negative factors heavily outweigh any positive indicators, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple (AAPL). Jefferies downgraded the stock to Underperform with a 13% downside target, citing weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and concerns about future revenue growth. The previous round predictions also lean strongly towards a negative outlook, reinforcing the expectation that the stock price will likely fall. While the overall market sentiment can influence price movements, the specific negative factors related to Apple highlighted in the article outweigh any potential positive catalysts in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  Slowing iPhone sales, concerns about AI innovation, and downward revisions of analyst revenue forecasts all point to a potential decline. The expectation of disappointing guidance for the current quarter further strengthens this negative outlook. While the overall market conditions (Fed meeting, inflation data) introduce uncertainty, the specific negative analysis of Apple significantly outweighs any potential positive factors.  The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering this information, along with the articles\u2019 specific negativity towards AAPL, my prediction leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term (one week).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple remains Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, with significant free cash flow and a growing services segment that could support future earnings growth. However, Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stake in Apple by 66.5% since 2022, citing the stock's stretched valuation and stagnant growth in sales and profits. The article suggests that Apple's high valuation relative to its recent performance makes it vulnerable to a price decline if market sentiment turns negative. While the long-term outlook for Apple is still somewhat positive due to its strong financials and services growth, the short-term risks from valuation concerns and reduced confidence from a major investor like Berkshire Hathaway weigh heavily. Given this balance, the probability of a price decline is higher than that of a rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline states that Jim Cramer sold some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's upcoming earnings report, suggesting that it may miss expectations and potentially lead to analyst downgrades. This negative sentiment could lead to a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, it's worth noting that Cramer also mentioned that Apple's stock tends to rebound after being downgraded, which provides some counterbalance to the negative outlook. Considering these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), but overall leans towards a negative short-term outlook due to Jim Cramer's comments. Cramer sold some Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and thinks the company will miss the quarter, potentially leading to a downgrade. Although he mentions that the stock tends to rebound after downgrades, the immediate negative sentiment suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, the estimated probabilities are based on the balance of positive and negative comments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including Jim Cramer selling his position due to it becoming too big a part of his portfolio, his belief that Apple will miss its upcoming quarter's earnings expectations, and potential analyst downgrades. These factors, combined with the historical trend that often accompanies such negative outlooks, suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. However, there is a slight countering factor as Cramer believes the stock could recover in the long term, though this is more speculative.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. presents a predominantly negative outlook, emphasizing significant headwinds like slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum, and analyst downgrades. Given that several analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts and the options market indicates an expected price movement of around 4.6%, these factors suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. Historical context, like Jim Cramer's comments about potential downgrades and his reduced stake in the company, further contribute to a negative sentiment. Given this analysis, the probabilities lean heavily toward a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is clearly negative for Apple (AAPL). Jefferies' downgrade to Underperform with a $200.75 price target, implying a 13% downside, is a significant bearish signal. The reasons cited \u2013 weak iPhone sales, slower AI uptake, and potential revenue growth miss \u2013 are fundamental concerns. The previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of a price decline, further solidifying the negative outlook. There are no significant positive counter-indicators in the provided news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a predominantly bearish outlook for Apple.  Slowing iPhone sales, concerns about innovation in AI, and downward revisions of analyst revenue forecasts all point to a potential near-term decline. The expectation of disappointing guidance for the current quarter further strengthens this negative outlook.  While the macroeconomic factors (Fed meeting, inflation data) introduce market-wide uncertainty, the specific negative analysis of Apple significantly outweighs any potential positive catalysts in the short term (one week).  The consensus among previous predictions also leans strongly towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering this information, along with the article's specific negativity towards AAPL and the lack of compelling counterarguments, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Berkshire Hathaway significantly reducing its stake due to concerns over Apple's stretched valuation and stagnant growth in sales and profits. Despite Apple's strong free cash flow and growing services segment, the negative sentiment from a major investor like Berkshire Hathaway and the high valuation relative to recent performance suggest a higher probability of a price decline in the near term. The previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, the long-term positive aspects of Apple's business provide some counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline states that Jim Cramer sold some of his Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and expressed concerns about the company's upcoming earnings report, suggesting that it may miss expectations and potentially lead to analyst downgrades.

(AAPL) due to Jim Cramer's comments about selling some of his Apple stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and his expectation that the company will miss its upcoming quarter's earnings expectations, potentially leading to analyst downgrades.
