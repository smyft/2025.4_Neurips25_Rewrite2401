(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Street Calls of the Week\nNews Content: Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and diminished innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing results. Additionally, the options market indicates a possible price movement of 4.6%, showing uncertainty. Given this negative outlook and the potential for the stock to fall further from its recent lows, the probability of a price decline is estimated to be higher than that of an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade to Underperform with a significant downside target (13%) based on weak iPhone sales, slow AI uptake and a missed revenue growth target paint a negative picture. This weighs heavily on near-term stock performance. While broader macroeconomic trends and future product releases could influence the stock, the analyst downgrade is likely to cause a decrease in near future price. Since it is negative analyst coverage, I give the stock a 70% chance of going down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates.  While the overall market environment (Fed meeting, inflation data) introduces uncertainty, the article's specific analysis of Apple leans heavily towards a negative short-term outlook for the stock. The probabilities are estimates based on this analysis and the short-term (one week) timeframe specified in the article.  The probability of a price rise for AAPL is low given the negative factors outlined, and the probability of a fall is relatively higher. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. On one hand, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Apple, suggesting concerns about the stock's stretched valuation and stagnant growth in sales and profits. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors. On the other hand, Apple's strong free cash flow, growing services segment, and potential for dividend increases provide some positive outlook. However, the overall tone of the article leans towards caution due to the high valuation and lack of significant growth, which may outweigh the positives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple's stock performance, stating that he sold some of his Apple shares because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He believes Apple's quarterly results will be disappointing and predicts the stock price will go lower. Additionally, he thinks there will be downgrades from analysts ahead of the quarterly report. Historically, Apple's stock has seen significant increases after being downgraded, but in the short term, Cramer's statements could lead to negative sentiment. Based on Cramer's comments, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and thinks it will miss the quarter, potentially leading to a downgrade. However, he also mentions that the stock is a long-term hold and tends to rebound after downgrades. Given this mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the balance of positive and negative comments. The negative comments about potentially missing the quarter and being downgraded suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, while the long-term positive outlook suggests some probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of their portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a potential stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
