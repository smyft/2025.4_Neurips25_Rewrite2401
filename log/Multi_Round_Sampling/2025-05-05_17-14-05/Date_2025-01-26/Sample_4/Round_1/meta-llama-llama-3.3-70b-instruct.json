(AAPL): \u2018We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple faces significant headwinds from slowing iPhone sales and diminished innovation momentum. Analysts have lowered revenue forecasts for Apple, and the upcoming earnings report is expected to show disappointing results. Additionally, the options market indicates a possible price movement of 4.6%, showing uncertainty. Given this negative outlook and the potential for the stock to fall further from its recent lows, the probability of a price decline is estimated to be higher than that of an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. Jefferies' downgrade to Underperform with a significant downside target (13%) based on weak iPhone sales, slow AI uptake and a missed revenue growth target paint a negative picture. This weighs heavily on near-term stock performance. While broader macroeconomic trends and future product releases could influence the stock, the analyst downgrade is likely to cause a decrease in near future price. Since it is negative analyst coverage, I give the stock a 70% chance of going down.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) due to slowing iPhone sales, reduced innovation momentum (particularly concerning AI adoption), and anticipated disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  Analyst forecasts have been revised downward, and the article highlights the stock's overvaluation according to InvestingPro's Fair Value models.  Conversely, the article is bullish on Meta (META), citing strong revenue and earnings growth, aggressive AI investment, and upward revisions of profit estimates.  While the overall market environment (Fed meeting, inflation data) introduces uncertainty, the article's specific analysis of Apple leans heavily towards a negative short-term outlook for the stock. The probabilities are estimates based on this analysis and the short-term (one week) timeframe specified in the article.  The probability of a price rise for AAPL is low given the negative factors outlined, and the probability of a fall is relatively higher. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's stock. On one hand, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Apple, suggesting concerns about the stock's stretched valuation and stagnant growth in sales and profits. This could lead to negative sentiment among investors. On the other hand, Apple's strong free cash flow, growing services segment, and potential for dividend increases provide some positive outlook. However, the overall tone of the article leans towards caution due to the high valuation and lack of significant growth, which may outweigh the positives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known financial analyst, has expressed concerns about Apple's stock performance, stating that he sold some of his Apple shares because it became too big a part of his portfolio. He believes Apple's quarterly results will be disappointing and predicts the stock price will go lower. Additionally, he thinks there will be downgrades from analysts ahead of the quarterly report. Historically, Apple's stock has seen significant increases after being downgraded, but in the short term, Cramer's statements could lead to negative sentiment. Based on Cramer's comments, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments about Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he mentions that he sold some stock because it became too big a part of his portfolio and thinks it will miss the quarter, potentially leading to a downgrade. However, he also mentions that the stock is a long-term hold and tends to rebound after downgrades. Given this mixed sentiment, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated based on the balance of positive and negative comments. The negative comments about potentially missing the quarter and being downgraded suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling, while the long-term positive outlook suggests some probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that he sold a portion of Apple's stock due to it becoming too big a part of their portfolio and anticipates that the stock could fall further as the company may miss their upcoming quarter's earnings expectations. Moreover, he hints that other analysts might downgrade the stock, increasing downward pressure. This negative sentiment combined with expected poor performance could lead to a potential stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
