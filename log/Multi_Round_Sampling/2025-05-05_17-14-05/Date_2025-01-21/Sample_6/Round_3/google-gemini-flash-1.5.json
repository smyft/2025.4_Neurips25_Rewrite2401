(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment from Wall Street towards Apple due to downgrades from firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies. The main concerns revolve around slowed growth in China and increased local competition in a crucial market. Analyst Ben Bajarin\u2019s comments suggest that growth prospects in China are uncertain, and he emphasizes the need for a new hardware cycle to stimulate interest in Apple's products. These factors strongly point to negative sentiment in the market, which would likely lead to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a cautiously negative outlook for Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report. It highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, the diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and increasing competition. Analysts' expectations are already low, so even meeting those expectations might not be enough to move the stock price significantly higher. The high valuation (32x forward earnings) suggests limited upside potential. The author explicitly advises against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. While a positive surprise is possible, the overall tone and analysis point towards a higher likelihood of a negative or neutral reaction to the report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing product lines (smartwatches and AirPods).  While Meta's advancements in AR/VR are noteworthy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small. Meta's success in the wearable market wouldn't necessarily translate to significant losses for Apple, especially given Apple's established brand loyalty and existing market dominance. The news is more relevant to Meta's stock than Apple's.  The probability of a price change for Apple is therefore considered low, leaning slightly towards no change. The potential for a small negative impact due to increased competition is considered slightly more probable than a positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline is a generic question about whether to buy Apple stock before a specific date (Jan. 30), but it lacks any substantive information or context (e.g., earnings reports, product launches, or macroeconomic factors). Without additional details, it is impossible to determine a clear bullish or bearish signal. Apple's stock price movement around such dates often depends on broader market trends, investor sentiment, or undisclosed events. Given the lack of actionable information, the probabilities are assigned neutrally.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an implied upside of 41% in 2025, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share. The analyst's optimism is based on Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products, the company's continued transformation as a services provider, and its world-leading capital-return program. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey relative to its trailing-12-month EPS, and Berkshire Hathaway's recent sale of 67% of its stake in Apple. Considering these factors, there is a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, but with some caution due to its current valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and does not provide any concrete positive or negative information about the company's current performance or future prospects. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price. However, given that Apple is a well-established and successful company, any neutral news may slightly lean towards a positive sentiment, assuming investors maintain confidence in the company's market leadership and future growth potential.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment towards Apple Inc. due to downgrades from Wall Street firms and concerns about slowing growth in China amidst increased local competition. Analyst Ben Bajarin's comments reflect a cautious outlook, suggesting limited near-term growth prospects for Apple in a crucial market. The need for a hardware cycle to stimulate renewed interest also reinforces the bearish viewpoint. This leads to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to any potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a cautiously bearish perspective on Apple's stock leading up to its Q1 2025 earnings report. It highlights stagnant revenue growth, concerns about share buyback effectiveness, and rising competition. The author advises against buying the stock before the report. While a positive earnings surprise could occur, the overall sentiment leans towards the stock either remaining flat or experiencing a decline. Considering these factors and incorporating insights from previous prediction rounds (where bearish sentiment dominated), I slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more pronounced expectation of a price decrease. However, the possibility of a surprise positive outcome is not entirely discounted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's aggressive expansion into the wearable tech market, directly competing with Apple's AirPods and Apple Watch.  While Meta's efforts might not immediately cause a significant drop in Apple's stock price, it presents a long-term competitive threat. The news doesn't offer any immediate positive catalysts for Apple stock. Previous predictions are mixed, with some showing a moderately bearish sentiment (e.g., 0.2 rise probability) and others displaying a neutral to slightly bullish stance (around 0.5 rise probability). Considering the long-term competitive pressure from Meta's advancements, coupled with the lack of positive news for Apple, I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall.  The inherent uncertainty and the potential for market fluctuations unrelated to this news also need to be considered, making a prediction of extreme probability unlikely.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' is a generic question without providing specific positive or negative information about Apple's performance or future prospects. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of neutral to slightly bearish sentiments, with some concerns about valuation, competition, and growth prospects in China. However, the lack of concrete negative or positive news suggests that the stock price movement is likely to be influenced more by broader market trends or undisclosed events rather than this headline alone. Given the mixed signals from previous analyses and the neutral nature of the headline, the probabilities are assigned slightly in favor of a rise, considering Apple's strong market position and potential for positive surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and does not provide any concrete positive or negative information about the company's current performance or future prospects. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of bearish and bullish sentiments. However, most models assign a higher probability to the stock price falling or remaining neutral due to concerns about growth prospects, competition, and valuation. Given the lack of concrete information in the headline and the mixed sentiments in previous predictions, I will assign a neutral probability to the stock price movement, leaning slightly towards a positive sentiment due to Apple's established brand loyalty and market dominance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock and the author's belief that this decision was incorrect. The news does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) directly, and as such, there's limited direct information impacting Apple's stock price. The analysis of GM stock suggests robust growth, strong earnings, and buybacks which imply a generally positive sentiment towards the automotive sector. However, without any explicit connection to Apple, the news does not provide a clear bullish or bearish signal for AAPL. Hence, the probability of stock price change remains relatively neutral.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment for Apple due to downgrades from Wall Street firms, particularly highlighting concerns about slowing growth in China and increased local competition. The uncertainty about future growth in a critical market, along with calls for a new hardware cycle to renew interest in Apple's products, suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price declining. Previous predictions leaned towards bearish sentiment, and the weighted commentary from analysts supports a cautious outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article leans bearish on Apple (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 2025 earnings report on January 30th. It highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, the diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and increased competition. Expectations for the quarter are not high, with analysts projecting modest growth. The author explicitly advises against buying the stock, citing its high valuation and the availability of better growth alternatives. Reviewing the prior rounds, there is a clear trend toward bearish sentiment given the continuous updates. Several AI models picked up on the news being negative and thus decreased the probability of the stock rising. I agree with this sentiment, and given the overall negative outlook and recommendation of the author, along with the trend of decreasing faith in a price increase from previous models, I am increasing my estimate that the price will decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing products.  This is a long-term threat, but not an immediate crisis. Meta's success is not guaranteed, and Apple retains significant brand loyalty and market share.  The news lacks immediate positive catalysts for Apple. Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from moderately bearish to slightly bullish. Considering the long-term competitive pressure and lack of immediate positive news, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise. However, the probability is not extreme due to the inherent uncertainty in the market and potential for unrelated factors to influence Apple's stock price. The overall impact of this specific news on Apple's stock price is likely to be relatively small in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' is neutral and does not provide specific bullish or bearish signals. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of sentiments, with some concerns about valuation, growth in China, and competition, while others highlight potential positive factors like AI integration and services growth. Given the lack of concrete negative or positive news, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced more by broader market trends or undisclosed events. Considering the mixed signals from previous analyses and the neutral nature of the headline, the probabilities are assigned slightly in favor of a rise, acknowledging Apple's strong market position and potential for positive surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Apple has an implied upside of 41% in 2025, with a price target of $325 per share. The optimism is based on Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, its transformation as a services provider, and its capital-return program. However, it's noted that Apple stock is historically pricey relative to its trailing-12-month EPS, and Berkshire Hathaway recently sold 67% of its stake in Apple. Considering these factors and previous predictions from other models, which show mixed sentiments with a leaning towards bearishness due to concerns about growth prospects, competition, and valuation, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising as 0.42 and falling as 0.58.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and does not offer any concrete positive or negative information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. Analyzing the previous predictions from various models, there is a mix of bearish and bullish sentiments. However, most models assign a higher probability to the stock price falling or remaining neutral due to concerns about growth prospects, competition, and valuation. Given the lack of concrete information in the headline and the mixed sentiments in previous predictions, the probabilities are assigned to reflect a cautious outlook, leaning slightly towards a neutral to bearish sentiment due to the existing concerns and competitive market environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock and the author's belief that this decision was incorrect.
