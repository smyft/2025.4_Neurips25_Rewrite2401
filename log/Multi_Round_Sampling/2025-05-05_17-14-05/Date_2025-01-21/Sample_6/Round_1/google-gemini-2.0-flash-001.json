(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: Jan. 30 will be a massive day for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock, as that's when the company reports results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ending around Dec. 31). This is a huge deal, as it includes the all-important holiday quarter, which could make or break Apple's stock.\n\nApple needs to change the narrative around its stock, as the company has delivered fairly stagnant growth over the past few years. The news could mark a huge shift in sentiment for Apple stock, and it needs a strong report to maintain the status quo.\n\nApple needs to kickstart its revenue growth this year\n\nApple is one of the most recognizable consumer electronics brands around the globe. It has built a powerhouse on an ecosystem that connects flawlessly with each other devices and successfully captured the most important audience for any company: young consumers.\n\nThis drove significant growth for many years, but since 2022, its revenue hasn't really grown.AAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThat's years of stagnant revenue, which isn't a great sign for a business. However, Apple is one of the best companies in the world, so that hasn't stopped it from growing its earnings through a combination of share buybacks and improving profitability. Still, there is only so much juice to squeeze when making a company more efficient, and Apple may be nearing its limit.AAPL Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThis leaves share buybacks as the primary way to grow earnings, but the effect of these repurchases may start to diminish. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28), Apple spent $25 billion on buybacks. But that occurred during a time when Apple was valued at near its highest point in five years.AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nThis makes the share repurchases less effective because the company has to pay a higher price to repurchase its own stock. This reduces the program's effect on earnings-per-share (EPS) growth.\n\nSo, with two of Apple's primary ways to grow earnings potentially running out of steam, the conversation circles back to revenue growth, which Apple has struggled with over the past few years.\n\nExpectations for Q1 aren't high\n\nFiscal Q1 encompasses the holiday quarter, and it will be a key moment for Apple to see if its iPhones and Apple Intelligence made a difference for consumers. Apple is seeing rising competition from Android phone makers, and this may weigh on Apple's results.\n\nWall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, as they project 3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth. Investors may be highly critical of Apple even if it posts results that everyone expects.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo, should investors buy Apple stock before Jan. 30? I'd say no.\n\nThere isn't much optimism about Apple's business right now, and even if it reports a blowout quarter, the expectations are so high that Apple's stock likely won't budge. It trades for 32 times forward earnings right now, which is normally a level reserved for a company growing earnings and revenue at least in the mid-teens range.\n\nApple isn't anywhere close to that, so there's a lot of risk and not a ton of reward left in the stock. There are many cheaper alternatives with better growth than Apple, and investors should invest their money in those before buying Apple shares.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment from Wall Street towards Apple due to downgrades from firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies. The main concerns revolve around slowed growth in China and increased local competition in a crucial market. Analyst Ben Bajarin\u2019s comments suggest that growth prospects in China are uncertain, and he emphasizes the need for a new hardware cycle to stimulate interest in Apple's products. These factors strongly point to negative sentiment in the market, which would likely lead to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a cautiously negative outlook for Apple's upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report. It highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, the diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and increasing competition. Analysts' expectations are already low, so even meeting those expectations might not be enough to move the stock price significantly higher. The high valuation (32x forward earnings) suggests limited upside potential. The author explicitly advises against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. While a positive surprise is possible, the overall tone and analysis point towards a higher likelihood of a negative or neutral reaction to the report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing product lines (smartwatches and AirPods).  While Meta's advancements in AR/VR are noteworthy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small. Meta's success in the wearable market wouldn't necessarily translate to significant losses for Apple, especially given Apple's established brand loyalty and existing market dominance. The news is more relevant to Meta's stock than Apple's.  The probability of a price change for Apple is therefore considered low, leaning slightly towards no change. The potential for a small negative impact due to increased competition is considered slightly more probable than a positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline is a generic question about whether to buy Apple stock before a specific date (Jan. 30), but it lacks any substantive information or context (e.g., earnings reports, product launches, or macroeconomic factors). Without additional details, it is impossible to determine a clear bullish or bearish signal. Apple's stock price movement around such dates often depends on broader market trends, investor sentiment, or undisclosed events. Given the lack of actionable information, the probabilities are assigned neutrally.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an implied upside of 41% in 2025, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share. The analyst's optimism is based on Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products, the company's continued transformation as a services provider, and its world-leading capital-return program. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey relative to its trailing-12-month EPS, and Berkshire Hathaway's recent sale of 67% of its stake in Apple. Considering these factors, there is a positive outlook for Apple's stock price, but with some caution due to its current valuation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and does not provide any concrete positive or negative information about the company's current performance or future prospects. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price. However, given that Apple is a well-established and successful company, any neutral news may slightly lean towards a positive sentiment, assuming investors maintain confidence in the company's market leadership and future growth potential.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
