While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. or its performance, the overall positive trend in the US equities markets suggests a favorable environment for stocks, including AAPL. Historically, strong market performance and positive economic sentiment have been associated with increased investor confidence, which can positively impact individual stock prices. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to the news, we must consider the general trend and potential investor sentiment. Given that the market ended higher and assuming Apple's stock is influenced by general market trends, there's a reasonable basis to believe that AAPL's stock price might have a higher probability of rising than falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
