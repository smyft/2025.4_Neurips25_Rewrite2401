(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Warren Buffett Stocks With Up to 50% Upside in 2025, According to Select Wall Street Analysts\nNews Content: In 1973, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) held its first annual shareholder meeting in the cafeteria of one of its subsidiaries and drew a few dozen people. Roughly 50 years later, around 40,000 people make the pilgrimage to Omaha each year. This is the Warren Buffett effect in action.\n\nSince taking over as Berkshire's CEO six decades ago, the Oracle of Omaha has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an aggregate gain of more than 5,681,000%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 17. This is far and away better than the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same timeline, and it's earned Buffett quite the following among professional and everyday investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nToday, Buffett oversees a 44-stock, $297 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway. However, the outlook for these 44 stocks can differ greatly.\n\nBased on the 12-month price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, three Buffett stocks can return up to 50% for their shareholders in 2025.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 44% in 2025\n\nThe first Warren Buffett stock that can deliver significant upside, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). According to Benchmark's Matthew Harrigan, Sirius XM stock can reach $32 per share, which would represent upside of 44% from where shares closed last week.\n\nOn one hand, Sirius XM has been contending with undeniable headwinds. Despite being the only licensed satellite-radio operator, it's still competing for listeners with online and terrestrial radio companies. Further, vehicle sales have been mostly stagnant over the last two years, which is a concern given that Sirius XM counts on transitioning promotional subscriptions with new vehicle purchases to self-pay subscribers.\n\nIn spite of these headwinds, there are reasons to believe a $32 price target is within reach. As noted, the company is a legal monopoly, which does afford it some degree of subscription pricing power that other radio operators and online streaming services may lack.\n\nThe more important differentiating factor for Sirius XM has always been how it generates its revenue. While most traditional radio companies rely almost exclusively on advertising to keep the lights on, Sirius XM brought in close to 77% of its net sales through the first nine months of 2024 from subscriptions and only around 20% from advertising. Whereas businesses can quickly pare back ad spending during periods of economic instability, subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service. In short, it makes Sirius XM's operating cash flow more consistent and predictable.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThere's an intriguing value proposition, as well. Amid one of the priciest stock markets in history, Sirius XM stock can be scooped up for just over 7 times forward-year earnings. If management can keep a lid on spending and lean on its monopoly driven subscription pricing power, it should bode well for Sirius XM's shareholders.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOccidental Petroleum: Implied upside of 50% in 2025\n\nA second Warren Buffett stock with plenty of upside potential in 2025 is a company the Oracle of Omaha has been buying hand over fist for three consecutive years: integrated oil and gas giant Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Analyst John Freeman at Raymond James foresees Occidental stock gushing to $78 per share, which would signal a gain of 50% in the new year.\n\nAlthough the spot price of crude oil is important for all integrated energy companies, it takes on added meaning for Occidental Petroleum. Despite having midstream transmission pipelines and downstream chemical operations, the lion's share of Occidental's revenue can be traced to its drilling operations. If the spot price of crude oil rises, Occidental's benefits more than its peers.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind about Occidental Petroleum is that the opposite scenario is also true. If the price for oil declines, few if any integrated energy companies is likely to be hit harder.\n\nThankfully, there are catalysts that can buoy the spot price of oil. Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago has created energy demand uncertainties in Europe. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's November victory and the expected implementation of tariffs paves the way for geopolitical tension that could drive the price of oil higher.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wildcard for Occidental Petroleum in 2025 is the company's balance sheet. Although it made some headway in reducing its debt following its acquisition of Anadarko in 2019, Occidental is still lugging around $25.5 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30, 2024. Though Buffett generally avoids businesses constrained by a lot of debt, Occidental appears to be the exception.\n\nApple: Implied upside of 41% in 2025\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes can soar in 2025 is none other than Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Less than a month ago, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, which implies upside of 41% in the new year.\n\nIves's excitement has to do with Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products. The ongoing incorporation of Apple Intelligence (Apple's AI operating model) into its physical devices via software updates is expected to boost consumer demand for the company's products and enhance brand loyalty.\n\nIn addition to revamping its physical products lineup with Apple Intelligence, the company's continued transformation as a services provider has taken off. Apple's Services segment, which is fueled by subscriptions, keeps its customers loyal to its umbrella of products and services, and should help to smooth out the revenue fluctuations that typically accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also point out the value Apple's world-leading capital-return program has provided. Since the start of 2013, it's repurchased more than $725 billion worth of its common stock and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43%. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining share count will typically see their earnings per share (EPS) climb and be viewed more favorably by investors.\n\nHowever, Apple stock is historically pricey, relative to its trailing-12-month EPS. Between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, Buffett oversaw the sale of 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Even though the Oracle of Omaha loves the Apple brand, its management team, and its capital-return program, he's first-and-foremost a value investor -- and \"value\" is a term that would be a stretch to describe Apple at the moment.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline questions whether Apple is still a market leader, suggesting potential concerns about its competitive position. Such a question may lead to uncertainty among investors, possibly causing a negative perception and resulting in a stock price decline. However, without specific adverse news or financial results, many investors may still hold confidence in Apple as a strong brand. Thus, while the questioning of leadership could lead to some selling pressure, the established reputation of Apple may mitigate severe declines. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, though both remain possible given the lack of strong negative news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential negative perception of Apple as its CEO is 'bending to Trump,' implying a possible compromise of Apple's values or brand image. However, the broader context of the article focuses on the cybersecurity sector's performance under a potential Trump administration, which is anticipated to be favorable due to looser regulations and increased investment through strategies such as The National Cyber Strategy. This positive outlook primarily benefits cybersecurity firms directly (Cloudflare, Fortinet, ZScaler, Palo Alto Networks) making the effect on Apple negligible because they exist in different industries. Furthermore, the article includes multiple events besides Apple's actions, e.g. Zuckerberg and Pichai 'schmoozing,' and broader benefits to cybersecurity firms unrelated to Apple. Considering these conflicting views the effect of this news is neutral. There may be a slight negative impact due to the implied perception of bending to Trump, but Apple's overall financial performance is unlikely to be dramatically affected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article itself tries to downplay the negative news, suggesting a buying opportunity. However, the weight of the analyst downgrades and the continued weakness in key markets like China leans towards a higher probability of further decline, at least in the short term.  The 17 instances of >2.5% moves in the last year highlight volatility making accurate prediction difficult. The probability estimates below reflect this inherent uncertainty and lean slightly towards the bearish sentiment due to the analyst downgrades.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell even as the market rallied today, suggesting that there may be company-specific factors negatively impacting its stock price. This could include poor earnings reports, negative analyst ratings, or other internal issues. Given that the stock fell amidst a broader market rally, it implies a higher likelihood of continued negative sentiment in the short term. However, without additional details, the exact reasons are unclear, but the headline alone suggests a bearish outlook for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including the benchmark indexes, ended higher on Tuesday following President Donald Trump's inauguration. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. or its performance, the overall positive trend in the US equities markets suggests a favorable environment for stocks, including AAPL. Historically, strong market performance and positive economic sentiment have been associated with increased investor confidence, which can positively impact individual stock prices. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to the news, we must consider the general trend and potential investor sentiment. Given that the market ended higher and assuming Apple's stock is influenced by general market trends, there's a reasonable basis to believe that AAPL's stock price might have a higher probability of rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, implying a 41% upside in the new year. This is due to Apple's integration of artificial intelligence solutions into its products and its transformation as a services provider. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey and that Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.6, indicating a moderate chance of an increase, and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4, indicating a lower chance of a decrease.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued downward trend for Apple's stock due to multiple factors such as a downgrade by Jefferies, weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales expectations, and potential issues with the upcoming iPhone SE 4. Additionally, there is cautious outlook on iPhone sales and shipments, especially in China. These factors suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline questions Apple's status as a market leader, which may raise concerns among investors about the company's competitive position. The mixed responses from previous predictions reflect a divide in sentiment, but overall lean towards a more negative perception due to analyst downgrades and current market conditions. The questioning suggests uncertainty about Apple's future growth and potential challenges. Given the lack of positive specific news and considering the historical volatility of Apple's stock, I estimate a higher probability of a price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, 'bending to Trump,' which could be perceived negatively by some investors depending on their political views. However, the context also mentions a potential positive impact on the cybersecurity sector under a Trump administration, which could indirectly benefit tech companies. The previous predictions have been mixed, with an overall slightly bearish trend. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, which didn't strongly lean in either direction, I will adjust slightly towards a neutral stance. The previous biases lean bearish as well.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  Two analyst downgrades, citing weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue, are significant negative factors.  The recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments further reinforces this negative sentiment. While the article mentions market overreactions and Apple's historical volatility, the weight of the negative news (analyst downgrades, weak sales) outweighs the potential for a short-term rebound. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the current market context and the specific negative news impacting Apple, a higher probability of a stock price fall is assigned.  However,  Apple's resilience and potential for future growth are acknowledged, preventing an extreme probability assignment to a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell even as the market rallied, suggesting company-specific negative factors. Previous predictions from various models show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 for a decline. Common reasons cited include analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales, and negative sentiment in key markets like China. While some models suggest a neutral or slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong brand and potential upside from AI integration, the majority lean towards a bearish short-term outlook. Considering the consensus and the headline's implication of underperformance despite a market rally, the probability of a stock price fall is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline is about the US equities markets ending higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. It does not directly mention Apple Inc. or provide specific information about the company's performance or prospects. Given that the overall market trend was positive, with benchmark equity indexes ending higher, this could imply a favorable environment for stocks, including Apple. However, without direct reference to Apple's performance or prospects, we must consider the general trend and potential investor sentiment. Historically, strong market performance and positive economic sentiment have been associated with increased investor confidence, which can positively impact individual stock prices. Therefore, based on the general positive trend in the US equities markets and assuming Apple's stock is influenced by this overall market sentiment, there is a reasonable basis to believe that AAPL's stock price might have a higher probability of rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, implying a 41% upside in the new year. This is due to Apple's integration of artificial intelligence solutions into its products and its transformation as a services provider. Although the article notes that Apple stock is historically pricey and that Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the overall sentiment is positive. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions from a high probability of the stock price falling to a moderate chance of it rising, the most recent analysis suggests a moderate to high chance of the stock price increasing due to the positive outlook from the analyst and the potential for growth in Apple's services segment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, weak iPhone sales expectations, and cautious outlook on the iPhone SE 4. Several predictions provided indicate a bearish sentiment with higher probabilities of the stock price falling. The news also shows Nvidia overtaking Apple in market capitalization as Apple's stock slides. These factors suggest ongoing negative sentiment and potential market reactions.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline questions Apple's status as a market leader, which raises concerns among investors about potential challenges to its competitive position. Previous rounds of predictions show a general bearish sentiment, with factors like analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales, and broader market pressures contributing to uncertainty about Apple's future growth. While some predictions acknowledge potential upside opportunities, the predominant sentiment leans towards a higher probability of stock price decline. Thus, given the context of questioning Apple\u2019s market leadership amidst negative indicators, I estimate a probability of a price fall at 0.65 and a price rise at 0.35.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple's CEO, along with other tech leaders, is seeking favor with Donald Trump. This could be interpreted in various ways by investors. Some may see it as a pragmatic move to protect the company's interests, particularly considering potential regulatory changes or policies under a new administration. Others might view it negatively, particularly if it is seen as compromising Apple's values or aligning with a controversial figure. While the reaction is likely not overly strong, it might create some caution among investors. The emphasis on potential benefits to the cybersecurity sector under a Trump administration doesn't directly translate to benefits for Apple. The previous rounds show a generally bearish sentiment with a trend toward price falls, with other information weighing on the sentiment. Considering the possible ethical implications and broader market sentiment and the trend in analyst beliefs, I will lean towards slight negative adjustment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a predominantly bearish outlook for Apple.  Two analyst downgrades, citing weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue, are significant negative factors. The recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments further reinforces this negative sentiment. While the article mentions the stock's volatility and the possibility of market overreaction, the negative news regarding sales and analyst sentiment appears to outweigh potential short-term rebounds. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but a clear majority leans toward a higher probability of a price fall, further supporting this assessment. Although Apple's long-term prospects and resilience are acknowledged, the immediate impact of the reported weak sales and negative analyst sentiment likely pushes the probability of a price fall higher in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell even as the market rallied, suggesting company-specific negative factors. Previous predictions from various models show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.75 for a decline. Common reasons cited include analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales, and negative sentiment in key markets like China. While some models suggest a neutral or slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong brand and potential upside from AI integration, the majority lean towards a bearish short-term outlook. Considering the consensus and the headline's implication of underperformance despite a market rally, the probability of a stock price fall is higher.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office' does not directly mention Apple Inc. or provide specific information about its performance or prospects. However, the overall positive trend in the US equities markets, with benchmark equity indexes ending higher, suggests a favorable environment for stocks, including Apple. Historically, strong market performance and positive economic sentiment have been associated with increased investor confidence, which can positively impact individual stock prices. On the other hand, previous predictions have highlighted several negative factors specific to Apple, such as analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales, and cautious outlooks on future products. Despite these mixed signals, the general positive trend in the market and the lack of directly negative news about Apple in the current headline suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc.

The news also shows Nvidia overtaking Apple in market capitalization as Apple's stock slides. These factors suggest ongoing negative sentiment and potential market reactions. Despite a few positive aspects, such as the potential for growth in services and AI, the overall negative sentiments dominate.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline questioning Apple's status as a market leader raises concerns about the company's competitive position, aligning with a trend of bearish sentiment from previous predictions. Factors such as analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales, and challenges in key markets contribute to uncertainty about Apple's future growth. While there are mentions of potential upside and the company's strong brand, the predominant belief leans towards a higher probability of stock price decline given the overarching negative indicators and recent market performance. Thus, I estimate a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline suggests potentially negative implications due to Apple's CEO 'bending to Trump,' raising ethical concerns for some investors. While the article discusses potential benefits to the cybersecurity sector under the Trump administration, this doesn't directly benefit Apple. Previous predictions exhibit a bearish trend. Balancing these factors and the lack of specific positive news for Apple suggests a slightly higher likelihood of a stock price fall. Moreover, the consistent predictions in the prior rounds contribute greatly to the higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative, with two analyst downgrades citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment is reinforced by the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments. While the article mentions Apple's historical volatility and potential market overreactions, the weight of the negative information strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall, at least in the short term.  The consensus among previous predictions also leans heavily towards a price drop.  However, Apple's long-term prospects and potential for growth in areas like AI and services mitigate an extreme probability assignment to a price fall.  The continued negative news and the lack of strong positive counterarguments suggest a bearish outlook.  The previous predictions which range from a 0.25 to 0.75 probability for fall and a 0.3 to 0.58 for a rise generally show a bearish bias. I am weighting the analysis towards the recent and persistent negative news and the consensus in other predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

These factors have led to a bearish sentiment in previous rounds, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Considering the mixed signals and the general positive trend in the market, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, but still acknowledging the significant negative sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc.
