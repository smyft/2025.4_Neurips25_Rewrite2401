      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline questions whether Apple is still a market leader, suggesting potential concerns about its competitive position. Such a question may lead to uncertainty among investors, possibly causing a negative perception and resulting in a stock price decline. However, without specific adverse news or financial results, many investors may still hold confidence in Apple as a strong brand. Thus, while the questioning of leadership could lead to some selling pressure, the established reputation of Apple may mitigate severe declines. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, though both remain possible given the lack of strong negative news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential negative perception of Apple as its CEO is 'bending to Trump,' implying a possible compromise of Apple's values or brand image. However, the broader context of the article focuses on the cybersecurity sector's performance under a potential Trump administration, which is anticipated to be favorable due to looser regulations and increased investment through strategies such as The National Cyber Strategy. This positive outlook primarily benefits cybersecurity firms directly (Cloudflare, Fortinet, ZScaler, Palo Alto Networks) making the effect on Apple negligible because they exist in different industries. Furthermore, the article includes multiple events besides Apple's actions, e.g. Zuckerberg and Pichai 'schmoozing,' and broader benefits to cybersecurity firms unrelated to Apple. Considering these conflicting views the effect of this news is neutral. There may be a slight negative impact due to the implied perception of bending to Trump, but Apple's overall financial performance is unlikely to be dramatically affected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article itself tries to downplay the negative news, suggesting a buying opportunity. However, the weight of the analyst downgrades and the continued weakness in key markets like China leans towards a higher probability of further decline, at least in the short term.  The 17 instances of >2.5% moves in the last year highlight volatility making accurate prediction difficult. The probability estimates below reflect this inherent uncertainty and lean slightly towards the bearish sentiment due to the analyst downgrades.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell even as the market rallied today, suggesting that there may be company-specific factors negatively impacting its stock price. This could include poor earnings reports, negative analyst ratings, or other internal issues. Given that the stock fell amidst a broader market rally, it implies a higher likelihood of continued negative sentiment in the short term. However, without additional details, the exact reasons are unclear, but the headline alone suggests a bearish outlook for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including the benchmark indexes, ended higher on Tuesday following President Donald Trump's inauguration. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. or its performance, the overall positive trend in the US equities markets suggests a favorable environment for stocks, including AAPL. Historically, strong market performance and positive economic sentiment have been associated with increased investor confidence, which can positively impact individual stock prices. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to the news, we must consider the general trend and potential investor sentiment. Given that the market ended higher and assuming Apple's stock is influenced by general market trends, there's a reasonable basis to believe that AAPL's stock price might have a higher probability of rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, implying a 41% upside in the new year. This is due to Apple's integration of artificial intelligence solutions into its products and its transformation as a services provider. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey and that Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.6, indicating a moderate chance of an increase, and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4, indicating a lower chance of a decrease.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued downward trend for Apple's stock due to multiple factors such as a downgrade by Jefferies, weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales expectations, and potential issues with the upcoming iPhone SE 4. Additionally, there is cautious outlook on iPhone sales and shipments, especially in China. These factors suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple's stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
