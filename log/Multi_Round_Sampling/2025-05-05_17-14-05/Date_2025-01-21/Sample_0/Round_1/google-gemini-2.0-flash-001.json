(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Cloudflare CEO on why Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech leaders are bending to Trump\nNews Content: Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline questions whether Apple is still a market leader, suggesting potential concerns about its competitive position. Such a question may lead to uncertainty among investors, possibly causing a negative perception and resulting in a stock price decline. However, without specific adverse news or financial results, many investors may still hold confidence in Apple as a strong brand. Thus, while the questioning of leadership could lead to some selling pressure, the established reputation of Apple may mitigate severe declines. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, though both remain possible given the lack of strong negative news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a potential negative perception of Apple as its CEO is 'bending to Trump,' implying a possible compromise of Apple's values or brand image. However, the broader context of the article focuses on the cybersecurity sector's performance under a potential Trump administration, which is anticipated to be favorable due to looser regulations and increased investment through strategies such as The National Cyber Strategy. This positive outlook primarily benefits cybersecurity firms directly (Cloudflare, Fortinet, ZScaler, Palo Alto Networks) making the effect on Apple negligible because they exist in different industries. Furthermore, the article includes multiple events besides Apple's actions, e.g. Zuckerberg and Pichai 'schmoozing,' and broader benefits to cybersecurity firms unrelated to Apple. Considering these conflicting views the effect of this news is neutral. There may be a slight negative impact due to the implied perception of bending to Trump, but Apple's overall financial performance is unlikely to be dramatically affected.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article itself tries to downplay the negative news, suggesting a buying opportunity. However, the weight of the analyst downgrades and the continued weakness in key markets like China leans towards a higher probability of further decline, at least in the short term.  The 17 instances of >2.5% moves in the last year highlight volatility making accurate prediction difficult. The probability estimates below reflect this inherent uncertainty and lean slightly towards the bearish sentiment due to the analyst downgrades.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell even as the market rallied today, suggesting that there may be company-specific factors negatively impacting its stock price. This could include poor earnings reports, negative analyst ratings, or other internal issues. Given that the stock fell amidst a broader market rally, it implies a higher likelihood of continued negative sentiment in the short term. However, without additional details, the exact reasons are unclear, but the headline alone suggests a bearish outlook for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equities markets, including the benchmark indexes, ended higher on Tuesday following President Donald Trump's inauguration. While the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. or its performance, the overall positive trend in the US equities markets suggests a favorable environment for stocks, including AAPL. Historically, strong market performance and positive economic sentiment have been associated with increased investor confidence, which can positively impact individual stock prices. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to the news, we must consider the general trend and potential investor sentiment. Given that the market ended higher and assuming Apple's stock is influenced by general market trends, there's a reasonable basis to believe that AAPL's stock price might have a higher probability of rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, implying a 41% upside in the new year. This is due to Apple's integration of artificial intelligence solutions into its products and its transformation as a services provider. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey and that Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising due to this news as 0.6, indicating a moderate chance of an increase, and the probability of the stock price falling as 0.4, indicating a lower chance of a decrease.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a continued downward trend for Apple's stock due to multiple factors such as a downgrade by Jefferies, weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales expectations, and potential issues with the upcoming iPhone SE 4. Additionally, there is cautious outlook on iPhone sales and shipments, especially in China. These factors suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple's stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
