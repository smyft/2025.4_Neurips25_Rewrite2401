(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge. Despite the injury, her investment activities have remained active.\n\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\n\nWhy It Matters: The trades have drawn attention following reports that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, outperforming most hedge funds and even the popular Inverse Cramer Stock Tracker. The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock sales that preceded a Department of Justice lawsuit against the company. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson has consistently maintained that all trades comply with federal disclosure requirements under the STOCK Act.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. while showcasing its potential due to strong financials and upcoming AI enhancements. However, the mention of Chen Tianqiao dumping some tech stocks may create uncertainty among investors, potentially dampening stock price rise. The positive aspects, like strong revenue growth and AI integration, provide a strong case for a price increase. Overall, it seems more probable that the stock price will rise due to the favorable financial performance and innovation trajectory, although some caution is warranted given the context of hedge fund movements.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' is inherently neutral. It's a question, not a recommendation or a statement of fact about positive developments. The lack of any specific details or further context in the headline implies that the article likely presents a balanced view or speculative analysis rather than concrete positive or negative catalysts. Without knowing the contents of the article, which could contain both bullish and bearish possibilities, based solely on the headline, there's no strong indication of either a rise or fall in stock price. The likelihood of either scenario is near 50/50.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article also highlights Apple's long-term growth and mentions other investment opportunities, suggesting a more balanced perspective than solely focusing on the negative news. Considering these factors, a significant further drop seems unlikely, though some short-term downward pressure is expected. The probability of a price rise is therefore lower than that of a fall, but not extremely low, indicating the market is mostly reacting to the downgrades, not a full-scale shift in investor confidence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the relationship between Big Tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential easing of tensions compared to Trump's first term. While the article primarily focuses on cybersecurity stocks and their performance under Trump's policies, it does not directly indicate any immediate positive or negative impact on Apple's stock. The mention of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration and engaging with the administration might be perceived as neutral or slightly positive, given the potential for favorable regulatory or policy outcomes. However, the news does not provide concrete information on Apple-specific developments that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the impact is likely minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi, a significant political figure, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia, while purchasing call options for Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). The sale of Apple shares by a high-profile investor could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily indicative of her confidence in the companies' future performance, as her investment activities may be influenced by various factors. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but the overall market conditions and other factors will also play a crucial role.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile investor, has sold a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) while purchasing call options on other tech giants, Alphabet and Amazon. This action may be perceived as a vote of no confidence in Apple's stock, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence and a subsequent fall in stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value or future performance. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares might be a portfolio rebalancing strategy rather than a bearish bet on the company. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising, but the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed sentiment about Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the one hand, the strong revenue growth, upcoming AI innovations, and a major hedge fund\u2019s stake in the company indicate potential for stock price appreciation. However, the mention of Chen Tianqiao's actions\u2014specifically, dumping certain tech stocks\u2014creates uncertainty that may dampen enthusiasm. Balancing these factors, the news leans slightly positive due to Apple\u2019s financial strength and innovation but is tempered by concerns regarding hedge fund movements. Overall, the probability of a price rise appears higher, but caution is warranted given the mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The initial news headline is neutral, simply posing a question about buying Apple stock before a specific date. However, considering the varied opinions from previous rounds, a clearer picture emerges. The first round presented both positive (strong financials, AI enhancements) and negative (hedge fund activity) aspects, leaning slightly bullish. Subsequent rounds introduced more bearish signals. Analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales, especially in China, and Nancy Pelosi selling Apple shares, are significant negative indicators. While Pelosi's moves might not be solely based on Apple's performance, they can create investor uncertainty. Several models in the previous rounds assigned higher probabilities to a stock price fall, driven by the negative news flow. Considering the weight of negative signals (downgrades, sales by prominent investors) outweighs the initial positive outlook, a bearish stance seems more justified.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple. Two analyst firms downgraded the stock, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  The reported 3.2% drop in share price reflects this negative sentiment. While the article acknowledges Apple's volatility and long-term potential, the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales figures points towards a higher probability of further price decreases in the short term. The previous day's drop related to declining Chinese market share adds to the negative pressure.  Although the market may not fundamentally change its perception of Apple's long-term prospects, the current news creates a negative short-term outlook. Considering the analyst downgrades and the recent price drop,  the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise in the immediate future.  The previous predictions range from a 30% to a 70% chance of a price fall, which supports a bearish outlook; I'm assigning a slightly higher probability based on the clear negative news and market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the relationship between Big Tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential easing of tensions compared to Trump's first term. While the article primarily focuses on cybersecurity stocks and their performance under Trump's policies, it does not directly indicate any immediate positive or negative impact on Apple's stock.

However, the news does not provide concrete information on Apple-specific developments that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the impact is likely minimal and the probabilities are balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news reports that Nancy Pelosi has sold a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) valued between $5 million and $25 million. This sale by a high-profile investor could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple's stock price. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares while purchasing call options in other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon might indicate a shift in confidence towards other companies in the sector. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value or future performance. The overall market conditions and other factors will also play a crucial role in determining the stock price movement. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising, but the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi has sold her Apple shares and purchased call options for Alphabet and Amazon. While this may be perceived as a negative signal, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value or future performance. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares might be a portfolio rebalancing strategy rather than a bearish bet on the company. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's stock price movement, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the overall market conditions and the fact that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily indicative of her confidence in the companies' future performance, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI.

Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
