(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Top-Stock Crown as Analysts Downgrade on iPhone Risk\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nShares fell 3.2% on Tuesday, closing at its lowest since November amid a rocky start to the year. The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news suggests a mixed sentiment regarding Apple Inc. while showcasing its potential due to strong financials and upcoming AI enhancements. However, the mention of Chen Tianqiao dumping some tech stocks may create uncertainty among investors, potentially dampening stock price rise. The positive aspects, like strong revenue growth and AI integration, provide a strong case for a price increase. Overall, it seems more probable that the stock price will rise due to the favorable financial performance and innovation trajectory, although some caution is warranted given the context of hedge fund movements.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' is inherently neutral. It's a question, not a recommendation or a statement of fact about positive developments. The lack of any specific details or further context in the headline implies that the article likely presents a balanced view or speculative analysis rather than concrete positive or negative catalysts. Without knowing the contents of the article, which could contain both bullish and bearish possibilities, based solely on the headline, there's no strong indication of either a rise or fall in stock price. The likelihood of either scenario is near 50/50.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article also highlights Apple's long-term growth and mentions other investment opportunities, suggesting a more balanced perspective than solely focusing on the negative news. Considering these factors, a significant further drop seems unlikely, though some short-term downward pressure is expected. The probability of a price rise is therefore lower than that of a fall, but not extremely low, indicating the market is mostly reacting to the downgrades, not a full-scale shift in investor confidence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news discusses the relationship between Big Tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential easing of tensions compared to Trump's first term. While the article primarily focuses on cybersecurity stocks and their performance under Trump's policies, it does not directly indicate any immediate positive or negative impact on Apple's stock. The mention of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration and engaging with the administration might be perceived as neutral or slightly positive, given the potential for favorable regulatory or policy outcomes. However, the news does not provide concrete information on Apple-specific developments that would significantly influence its stock price. Therefore, the impact is likely minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi, a significant political figure, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia, while purchasing call options for Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). The sale of Apple shares by a high-profile investor could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple\u2019s stock price. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily indicative of her confidence in the companies' future performance, as her investment activities may be influenced by various factors. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but the overall market conditions and other factors will also play a crucial role.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile investor, has sold a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) while purchasing call options on other tech giants, Alphabet and Amazon. This action may be perceived as a vote of no confidence in Apple's stock, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence and a subsequent fall in stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value or future performance. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares might be a portfolio rebalancing strategy rather than a bearish bet on the company. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising, but the overall impact is likely to be limited and short-term.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
