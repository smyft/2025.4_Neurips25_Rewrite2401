On one hand, Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of AAPL shares (between $5M and $25M) could be interpreted negatively by the market, potentially creating downward pressure on the stock price. The market often views insider (or in this case, politically connected individual) selling as a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, even if that is clearly not the case and these were just a rebalancing of her portfolio. On the other hand, the fact that Pelosi is making new calls or puts on other companies is less relevant to Apple. Given the large volume of shares sold and the market's potential negative reaction to perceived insider selling, a slight downward pressure is assessed as more probable. However, Apple is a large, well-established company, thus the price action resulting from this news is unlikely to have a major effect. Additionally, while the GuruFocus warning sign designation for Amazon is included in the disclosure, it doesn't influence our probability assessment for Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
