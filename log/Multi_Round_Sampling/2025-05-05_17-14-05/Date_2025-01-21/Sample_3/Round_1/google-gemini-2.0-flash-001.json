(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi's latest congressional trading disclosure reveals new bets on tech giants Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while offloading Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nAccording to the filing, Pelosi purchased 50 call options on Alphabet and Amazon with a $150 strike price and a Jan. 16, 2026, expiration date, each worth between $250,001 and $500,000. The trades took place on Jan. 14, 2025. Meanwhile, she sold 31,600 Apple shares on Dec. 31, 2024, in a transaction valued between $5M and $25M. On the same day, she sold 10,000 Nvidia shares, worth $1M to $5M, but also purchased Nvidia shares worth up to $500,000 on Jan. 14, 2025.\n\nBeyond big tech, Pelosi added Palo Alto Networks (PANW) shares worth up to $5M, Tempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) shares worth up to $100,000, and Vistra (NYSE:VST) shares worth up to $1M. At 84, Pelosi remains an active market participant, continuing to adjust her portfolio amid shifting economic and tech trends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive projections for Apple's stock price, citing an implied upside of 41% by analysts, driven by the integration of AI solutions and the strength of its Services segment. However, it is tempered by concerns about valuation and recent reductions in Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic due to the expected AI enhancements and ongoing share repurchase program, even though the historical high valuations add some risk. Thus, there is a higher likelihood of price rise, but some potential for decline remains.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news piece presents a mixed signal for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of AAPL shares (between $5M and $25M) could be interpreted negatively by the market, potentially creating downward pressure on the stock price. The market often views insider (or in this case, politically connected individual) selling as a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, even if that is clearly not the case and these were just a rebalancing of her portfolio. On the other hand, the fact that Pelosi is making new calls or puts on other companies is less relevant to Apple. Given the large volume of shares sold and the market's potential negative reaction to perceived insider selling, a slight downward pressure is assessed as more probable. However, Apple is a large, well-established company, thus the price action resulting from this news is unlikely to have a major effect. Additionally, while the GuruFocus warning sign designation for Amazon is included in the disclosure, it doesn't influence our probability assessment for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett selling his stake in General Motors (GM), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Buffett's reduction of his Apple holdings, it doesn't provide any new information about Apple's prospects or performance to significantly impact its stock price.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to the Apple stock price movement.  Any price movement in AAPL would likely be due to factors unrelated to this article, such as broader market trends or Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports significant analyst downgrades for Apple due to concerns over declining iPhone sales, lack of innovation in product lineup, and underperformance in hardware and services. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor confidence and stock price in the short term. The immediate market reaction was a 4% drop, indicating strong negative sentiment. Given the widespread analyst skepticism and the specific concerns raised, the probability of further stock price decline is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is slipping, which suggests a negative short-term impact on the stock price. Additionally, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform', citing expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. This downgrade and the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's future sales prospects contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Nvidia's resurgence as the world's most valuable company also implies a relative decline in Apple's market position, further supporting the likelihood of a stock price decrease.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions a price target increase for Barclays by Deutsche Bank, which indicates a positive sentiment towards the company. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Barclays, suggesting a potential partnership or collaboration. The news about Barclays' price target increase does not directly impact Apple's stock price. Nonetheless, if we consider the potential partnership, a successful collaboration could positively impact Apple's stock price. Given the indirect nature of the news, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated based on the potential implications of the partnership.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Her selling of Apple shares, particularly a large volume ($5M-$25M), is generally considered a negative signal, even if it's just portfolio rebalancing. While she is buying Alphabet and Amazon calls, those actions don't directly benefit Apple. The GuruFocus warning signs on Amazon are not relevant to Apple's stock. Analyzing prior predictions shows a bias towards negative or neutral sentiment, with earlier rounds showing larger impacts from downgrades perceived issues, whereas later rounds show only indirect impacts. I lean towards a slightly more negative sentiment, but Apple is a large company and Pelosi's selling, while notable, isn't catastrophic.
