(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive projections for Apple's stock price, citing an implied upside of 41% by analysts, driven by the integration of AI solutions and the strength of its Services segment. However, it is tempered by concerns about valuation and recent reductions in Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic due to the expected AI enhancements and ongoing share repurchase program, even though the historical high valuations add some risk. Thus, there is a higher likelihood of price rise, but some potential for decline remains.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news piece presents a mixed signal for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of AAPL shares (between $5M and $25M) could be interpreted negatively by the market, potentially creating downward pressure on the stock price. The market often views insider (or in this case, politically connected individual) selling as a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, even if that is clearly not the case and these were just a rebalancing of her portfolio. On the other hand, the fact that Pelosi is making new calls or puts on other companies is less relevant to Apple. Given the large volume of shares sold and the market's potential negative reaction to perceived insider selling, a slight downward pressure is assessed as more probable. However, Apple is a large, well-established company, thus the price action resulting from this news is unlikely to have a major effect. Additionally, while the GuruFocus warning sign designation for Amazon is included in the disclosure, it doesn't influence our probability assessment for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett selling his stake in General Motors (GM), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Buffett's reduction of his Apple holdings, it doesn't provide any new information about Apple's prospects or performance to significantly impact its stock price.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to the Apple stock price movement.  Any price movement in AAPL would likely be due to factors unrelated to this article, such as broader market trends or Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports significant analyst downgrades for Apple due to concerns over declining iPhone sales, lack of innovation in product lineup, and underperformance in hardware and services. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor confidence and stock price in the short term. The immediate market reaction was a 4% drop, indicating strong negative sentiment. Given the widespread analyst skepticism and the specific concerns raised, the probability of further stock price decline is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is slipping, which suggests a negative short-term impact on the stock price. Additionally, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform', citing expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. This downgrade and the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's future sales prospects contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Nvidia's resurgence as the world's most valuable company also implies a relative decline in Apple's market position, further supporting the likelihood of a stock price decrease.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions a price target increase for Barclays by Deutsche Bank, which indicates a positive sentiment towards the company. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Barclays, suggesting a potential partnership or collaboration. The news about Barclays' price target increase does not directly impact Apple's stock price. Nonetheless, if we consider the potential partnership, a successful collaboration could positively impact Apple's stock price. Given the indirect nature of the news, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated based on the potential implications of the partnership.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
