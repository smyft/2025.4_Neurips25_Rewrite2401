(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Warren Buffett Stocks With Up to 50% Upside in 2025, According to Select Wall Street Analysts\nNews Content: In 1973, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) held its first annual shareholder meeting in the cafeteria of one of its subsidiaries and drew a few dozen people. Roughly 50 years later, around 40,000 people make the pilgrimage to Omaha each year. This is the Warren Buffett effect in action.\n\nSince taking over as Berkshire's CEO six decades ago, the Oracle of Omaha has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an aggregate gain of more than 5,681,000%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 17. This is far and away better than the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same timeline, and it's earned Buffett quite the following among professional and everyday investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nToday, Buffett oversees a 44-stock, $297 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway. However, the outlook for these 44 stocks can differ greatly.\n\nBased on the 12-month price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, three Buffett stocks can return up to 50% for their shareholders in 2025.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 44% in 2025\n\nThe first Warren Buffett stock that can deliver significant upside, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). According to Benchmark's Matthew Harrigan, Sirius XM stock can reach $32 per share, which would represent upside of 44% from where shares closed last week.\n\nOn one hand, Sirius XM has been contending with undeniable headwinds. Despite being the only licensed satellite-radio operator, it's still competing for listeners with online and terrestrial radio companies. Further, vehicle sales have been mostly stagnant over the last two years, which is a concern given that Sirius XM counts on transitioning promotional subscriptions with new vehicle purchases to self-pay subscribers.\n\nIn spite of these headwinds, there are reasons to believe a $32 price target is within reach. As noted, the company is a legal monopoly, which does afford it some degree of subscription pricing power that other radio operators and online streaming services may lack.\n\nThe more important differentiating factor for Sirius XM has always been how it generates its revenue. While most traditional radio companies rely almost exclusively on advertising to keep the lights on, Sirius XM brought in close to 77% of its net sales through the first nine months of 2024 from subscriptions and only around 20% from advertising. Whereas businesses can quickly pare back ad spending during periods of economic instability, subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service. In short, it makes Sirius XM's operating cash flow more consistent and predictable.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThere's an intriguing value proposition, as well. Amid one of the priciest stock markets in history, Sirius XM stock can be scooped up for just over 7 times forward-year earnings. If management can keep a lid on spending and lean on its monopoly driven subscription pricing power, it should bode well for Sirius XM's shareholders.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOccidental Petroleum: Implied upside of 50% in 2025\n\nA second Warren Buffett stock with plenty of upside potential in 2025 is a company the Oracle of Omaha has been buying hand over fist for three consecutive years: integrated oil and gas giant Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Analyst John Freeman at Raymond James foresees Occidental stock gushing to $78 per share, which would signal a gain of 50% in the new year.\n\nAlthough the spot price of crude oil is important for all integrated energy companies, it takes on added meaning for Occidental Petroleum. Despite having midstream transmission pipelines and downstream chemical operations, the lion's share of Occidental's revenue can be traced to its drilling operations. If the spot price of crude oil rises, Occidental's benefits more than its peers.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind about Occidental Petroleum is that the opposite scenario is also true. If the price for oil declines, few if any integrated energy companies is likely to be hit harder.\n\nThankfully, there are catalysts that can buoy the spot price of oil. Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago has created energy demand uncertainties in Europe. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's November victory and the expected implementation of tariffs paves the way for geopolitical tension that could drive the price of oil higher.\n\nPerhaps the biggest wildcard for Occidental Petroleum in 2025 is the company's balance sheet. Although it made some headway in reducing its debt following its acquisition of Anadarko in 2019, Occidental is still lugging around $25.5 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30, 2024. Though Buffett generally avoids businesses constrained by a lot of debt, Occidental appears to be the exception.\n\nApple: Implied upside of 41% in 2025\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes can soar in 2025 is none other than Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Less than a month ago, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives lifted his price target on Apple to $325 per share, which implies upside of 41% in the new year.\n\nIves's excitement has to do with Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products. The ongoing incorporation of Apple Intelligence (Apple's AI operating model) into its physical devices via software updates is expected to boost consumer demand for the company's products and enhance brand loyalty.\n\nIn addition to revamping its physical products lineup with Apple Intelligence, the company's continued transformation as a services provider has taken off. Apple's Services segment, which is fueled by subscriptions, keeps its customers loyal to its umbrella of products and services, and should help to smooth out the revenue fluctuations that typically accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also point out the value Apple's world-leading capital-return program has provided. Since the start of 2013, it's repurchased more than $725 billion worth of its common stock and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43%. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining share count will typically see their earnings per share (EPS) climb and be viewed more favorably by investors.\n\nHowever, Apple stock is historically pricey, relative to its trailing-12-month EPS. Between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, Buffett oversaw the sale of 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Even though the Oracle of Omaha loves the Apple brand, its management team, and its capital-return program, he's first-and-foremost a value investor -- and \"value\" is a term that would be a stretch to describe Apple at the moment.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive projections for Apple's stock price, citing an implied upside of 41% by analysts, driven by the integration of AI solutions and the strength of its Services segment. However, it is tempered by concerns about valuation and recent reductions in Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic due to the expected AI enhancements and ongoing share repurchase program, even though the historical high valuations add some risk. Thus, there is a higher likelihood of price rise, but some potential for decline remains.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news piece presents a mixed signal for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of AAPL shares (between $5M and $25M) could be interpreted negatively by the market, potentially creating downward pressure on the stock price. The market often views insider (or in this case, politically connected individual) selling as a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, even if that is clearly not the case and these were just a rebalancing of her portfolio. On the other hand, the fact that Pelosi is making new calls or puts on other companies is less relevant to Apple. Given the large volume of shares sold and the market's potential negative reaction to perceived insider selling, a slight downward pressure is assessed as more probable. However, Apple is a large, well-established company, thus the price action resulting from this news is unlikely to have a major effect. Additionally, while the GuruFocus warning sign designation for Amazon is included in the disclosure, it doesn't influence our probability assessment for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Warren Buffett selling his stake in General Motors (GM), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Buffett's reduction of his Apple holdings, it doesn't provide any new information about Apple's prospects or performance to significantly impact its stock price.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to the Apple stock price movement.  Any price movement in AAPL would likely be due to factors unrelated to this article, such as broader market trends or Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports significant analyst downgrades for Apple due to concerns over declining iPhone sales, lack of innovation in product lineup, and underperformance in hardware and services. These factors are likely to negatively impact investor confidence and stock price in the short term. The immediate market reaction was a 4% drop, indicating strong negative sentiment. Given the widespread analyst skepticism and the specific concerns raised, the probability of further stock price decline is high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock is slipping, which suggests a negative short-term impact on the stock price. Additionally, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform', citing expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. This downgrade and the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's future sales prospects contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Nvidia's resurgence as the world's most valuable company also implies a relative decline in Apple's market position, further supporting the likelihood of a stock price decrease.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article mentions a price target increase for Barclays by Deutsche Bank, which indicates a positive sentiment towards the company. However, the article also mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Barclays, suggesting a potential partnership or collaboration. The news about Barclays' price target increase does not directly impact Apple's stock price. Nonetheless, if we consider the potential partnership, a successful collaboration could positively impact Apple's stock price. Given the indirect nature of the news, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated based on the potential implications of the partnership.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
