(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today\nNews Content: Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to soft iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, especially in China, have weakened market sentiment around Apple Inc. The drop of 3.2% on Tuesday and the overall trend of a significant decline (11% in January) suggest that there is a negative outlook among investors. Given that two prominent analysts have expressed bearish sentiment and that the consensus buy rating has declined, it\u2019s reasonable to predict a higher probability of further decline than an increase in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), declining market share, and a lack of investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives, all point towards potential downward pressure on the stock price. The specific mentions of reduced revenue forecasts and the underperformance of Apple's stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further solidify this bearish outlook. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential positive catalysts, they are presented as possibilities rather than certainties and are unlikely to immediately offset the current negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% on the news emphasizes the market's concern. Earnings are slated to be released soon, which could provide additional insight into the actual performance of the company in the last quarter. However, the current projections, given the analyst downgrades, suggest disappointing results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing product lines (smartwatches and AirPods).  While Meta's advancements in AR/VR are noteworthy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small. Meta's success in these new markets isn't guaranteed, and the news doesn't present any immediate threat to Apple's core business or financial performance.  The probability of a stock price rise or fall is therefore mostly dependent on other market factors and not significantly influenced by this specific news.  A slightly higher probability of no change is implied.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a 4.1% drop in Apple's stock price due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence on consumer demand. The downgrades and lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. Given the negative sentiment, weak guidance, and high valuation (36x earnings), the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. However, Loop Capital's optimism about long-term growth and AI potential provides some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. The analyst, Ben Bajarin, mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. This downgrade and cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses how Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in General Motors, but the author believes this decision was wrong. The company has been performing well, with resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share, especially in electric vehicles. Additionally, the company is aggressively using excess capital to buy back shares, which has positively impacted the stock price. Given this information, it seems the news is actually about General Motors (GM) and not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), but since AAPL is mentioned as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, there might be a slight indirect implication. However, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook, not AAPL's. Therefore, the reasoning for AAPL's stock price movement is indirect and not strongly influenced by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by Loop Capital and Jefferies due to significantly weakened iPhone sales, particularly in China, underscore a deteriorating outlook for Apple. The downgrades reflect lower expectations for future earnings and potential disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter, leading to increased bearish sentiment. Furthermore, a majority of analysts still hold a buy rating, but the overall downward trend in stock price and market capitalization suggests that investor confidence has been shaken. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a high likelihood of further declines in the stock price in the near term, amid ongoing investor concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds heavily leans towards a negative outlook for Apple's stock. The news article details downgrades from two firms citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and skepticism about the impact of Apple's AI initiatives. The company's struggles in China, compounded by competition and slower economic growth, are significant concerns. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential catalysts, they seem unlikely to offset immediate pressures. The previous predictions reflect this negative sentiment. Given the continued emphasis on these problems in this round's news, I expect the short-term pressure on the stock to continue outweighing any positive impacts from other developments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, which is a competitive threat to Apple in the long term. However, the news is not directly about Apple and does not contain any immediate negative or positive information about Apple's financial performance or products.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minor.  Considering previous predictions largely focused on negative Apple-specific news (downgrades, weak sales), and this news is comparatively neutral, the probability of a stock price movement associated with this news is low. The influence of this news alone is likely to be overshadowed by other market factors and pre-existing sentiment around Apple.  Therefore, the probabilities lean towards a relatively unchanged stock price, with slightly higher odds of no movement than either a rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by two major analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence. These downgrades and the lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. The high valuation (36x earnings) and weak guidance further exacerbate the negative sentiment. While Loop Capital maintains some optimism about long-term growth, the immediate concerns dominate the market outlook. Given the overwhelming negative sentiment and the stock's recent decline, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. Analyst Ben Bajarin mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. These downgrades and the cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The consensus among multiple predictions is that the stock price has a higher probability of falling than rising due to the negative sentiment and weak guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors stock, but the author believes this decision was wrong due to GM's resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook.

However, considering the overall market sentiment and previous predictions, which indicated a bearish outlook for Apple due to disappointing iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, the probability of the stock price falling might still be slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum. Previous predictions also indicate a consistent bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts from Jefferies and Loop Capital highlight significant concerns regarding iPhone sales, particularly in the critical China market. The overall sentiment around Apple has turned bearish, with weak sales data prompting a negative outlook. The consensus among analysts has shifted, indicating potential disappointing earnings, further amplifying fears regarding the company's short-term growth prospects. While some analysts hold optimistic views for the long term, the immediate forecasts are clear, leading to a higher probability of price decline. Given these factors, the probabilities suggest a significant likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent downgrades from multiple analysts (Jefferies, Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales (especially in China) and concerns about the impact of AI continue to pressure Apple's stock. The stock already fell 3.7% on Tuesday in response to the news. Prior round analyses and predictions heavily favor a negative outlook. The new iPhone SE mentioned is not considered a strong enough catalyst to reverse the downward trend in the very near term. Therefore, negative pressure will continue to outweigh potential positive catalysts. Given the convergence among the previous models, and the continuation of the negative narratives, I am keeping the probabilities in line with the previous round's general consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, which is a competitive threat to Apple, but the impact is likely to be indirect and long-term.  The news itself doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or immediate prospects.  The previous predictions heavily favor a negative outlook for Apple due to concerns about weak iPhone sales (especially in China), analyst downgrades, and skepticism about the short-term impact of Apple's AI initiatives.  This negative sentiment is significantly more influential than the relatively neutral news about Meta's product expansion.  Therefore, while Meta's moves present a future competitive threat, the existing negative sentiment surrounding Apple's financial performance currently dominates the factors influencing the stock price. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore low, with a much higher probability of a continued price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by two major analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence. These downgrades and the lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. The high valuation (36x earnings) and weak guidance further exacerbate the negative sentiment.

The consensus among multiple predictions is that the stock price has a higher probability of falling than rising due to the negative sentiment and weak guidance. Considering the downgrades, concerns around iPhone sales, and skepticism about AI initiatives, the market sentiment remains bearish.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors stock, but the author believes this decision was wrong due to GM's resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook. Given the indirect implication and the lack of direct information about Apple's current performance or prospects, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is not strongly influenced by this news.

Previous predictions also indicate a consistent bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further decline.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The recent downgrades from multiple analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital) indicate significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the critical Chinese market. The consensus among analysts has turned negative, with substantial risks identified for upcoming earnings due to potential disappointing guidance. The prevailing sentiment is dominated by fears of lower sales and the inability of AI advancements to spur immediate growth. Given the stock's recent decline and the overall bearish outlook reflected by past predictions, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of further decline over rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The consistent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, driven by weak iPhone sales (particularly in China) and skepticism regarding Apple's AI initiatives, continue to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. The stock's recent decline of 3.7% reflects this negative outlook. Previous predictions across multiple models consistently point to a bearish trend, further reinforcing the likelihood of a continued downward trajectory. While potential product releases such as the new iPhone SE are mentioned, they are unlikely to immediately offset the prevailing negative pressures. The imminent earnings report could be a catalyst for a shift in sentiment, but current projections suggest disappointing results, increasing the chance of a continued decline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news about Meta's expansion into wearables is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement.  The overwhelming consensus from previous prediction rounds points to a bearish outlook for Apple due to weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and analyst downgrades.  These factors are significantly more influential than the indirect competitive threat posed by Meta's new products.  The negative sentiment surrounding Apple's financial performance and growth prospects outweighs any potential long-term competitive concerns from Meta's advancements. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall remains high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by two major analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence.
