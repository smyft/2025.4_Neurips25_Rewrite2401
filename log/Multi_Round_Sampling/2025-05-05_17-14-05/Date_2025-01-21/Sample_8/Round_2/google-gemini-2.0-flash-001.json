(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to soft iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, especially in China, have weakened market sentiment around Apple Inc. The drop of 3.2% on Tuesday and the overall trend of a significant decline (11% in January) suggest that there is a negative outlook among investors. Given that two prominent analysts have expressed bearish sentiment and that the consensus buy rating has declined, it\u2019s reasonable to predict a higher probability of further decline than an increase in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), declining market share, and a lack of investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives, all point towards potential downward pressure on the stock price. The specific mentions of reduced revenue forecasts and the underperformance of Apple's stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further solidify this bearish outlook. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential positive catalysts, they are presented as possibilities rather than certainties and are unlikely to immediately offset the current negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% on the news emphasizes the market's concern. Earnings are slated to be released soon, which could provide additional insight into the actual performance of the company in the last quarter. However, the current projections, given the analyst downgrades, suggest disappointing results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing product lines (smartwatches and AirPods).  While Meta's advancements in AR/VR are noteworthy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small. Meta's success in these new markets isn't guaranteed, and the news doesn't present any immediate threat to Apple's core business or financial performance.  The probability of a stock price rise or fall is therefore mostly dependent on other market factors and not significantly influenced by this specific news.  A slightly higher probability of no change is implied.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a 4.1% drop in Apple's stock price due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence on consumer demand. The downgrades and lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. Given the negative sentiment, weak guidance, and high valuation (36x earnings), the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. However, Loop Capital's optimism about long-term growth and AI potential provides some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. The analyst, Ben Bajarin, mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. This downgrade and cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses how Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in General Motors, but the author believes this decision was wrong. The company has been performing well, with resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share, especially in electric vehicles. Additionally, the company is aggressively using excess capital to buy back shares, which has positively impacted the stock price. Given this information, it seems the news is actually about General Motors (GM) and not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), but since AAPL is mentioned as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, there might be a slight indirect implication. However, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook, not AAPL's. Therefore, the reasoning for AAPL's stock price movement is indirect and not strongly influenced by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by Loop Capital and Jefferies due to significantly weakened iPhone sales, particularly in China, underscore a deteriorating outlook for Apple. The downgrades reflect lower expectations for future earnings and potential disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter, leading to increased bearish sentiment. Furthermore, a majority of analysts still hold a buy rating, but the overall downward trend in stock price and market capitalization suggests that investor confidence has been shaken. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a high likelihood of further declines in the stock price in the near term, amid ongoing investor concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds heavily leans towards a negative outlook for Apple's stock. The news article details downgrades from two firms citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and skepticism about the impact of Apple's AI initiatives. The company's struggles in China, compounded by competition and slower economic growth, are significant concerns. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential catalysts, they seem unlikely to offset immediate pressures. The previous predictions reflect this negative sentiment. Given the continued emphasis on these problems in this round's news, I expect the short-term pressure on the stock to continue outweighing any positive impacts from other developments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, which is a competitive threat to Apple in the long term. However, the news is not directly about Apple and does not contain any immediate negative or positive information about Apple's financial performance or products.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minor.  Considering previous predictions largely focused on negative Apple-specific news (downgrades, weak sales), and this news is comparatively neutral, the probability of a stock price movement associated with this news is low. The influence of this news alone is likely to be overshadowed by other market factors and pre-existing sentiment around Apple.  Therefore, the probabilities lean towards a relatively unchanged stock price, with slightly higher odds of no movement than either a rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by two major analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence. These downgrades and the lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. The high valuation (36x earnings) and weak guidance further exacerbate the negative sentiment. While Loop Capital maintains some optimism about long-term growth, the immediate concerns dominate the market outlook. Given the overwhelming negative sentiment and the stock's recent decline, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. Analyst Ben Bajarin mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. These downgrades and the cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The consensus among multiple predictions is that the stock price has a higher probability of falling than rising due to the negative sentiment and weak guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors stock, but the author believes this decision was wrong due to GM's resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share. Although the article mentions Apple Inc. as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook. Given the indirect implication and the lack of direct information about Apple's current performance or prospects, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is not strongly influenced by this news. However, considering the overall market sentiment and previous predictions, which indicated a bearish outlook for Apple due to disappointing iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, the probability of the stock price falling might still be slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI.
