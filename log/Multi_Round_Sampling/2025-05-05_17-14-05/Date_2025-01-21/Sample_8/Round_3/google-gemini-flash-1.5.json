(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to soft iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, especially in China, have weakened market sentiment around Apple Inc. The drop of 3.2% on Tuesday and the overall trend of a significant decline (11% in January) suggest that there is a negative outlook among investors. Given that two prominent analysts have expressed bearish sentiment and that the consensus buy rating has declined, it\u2019s reasonable to predict a higher probability of further decline than an increase in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), declining market share, and a lack of investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives, all point towards potential downward pressure on the stock price. The specific mentions of reduced revenue forecasts and the underperformance of Apple's stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further solidify this bearish outlook. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential positive catalysts, they are presented as possibilities rather than certainties and are unlikely to immediately offset the current negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% on the news emphasizes the market's concern. Earnings are slated to be released soon, which could provide additional insight into the actual performance of the company in the last quarter. However, the current projections, given the analyst downgrades, suggest disappointing results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing product lines (smartwatches and AirPods).  While Meta's advancements in AR/VR are noteworthy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small. Meta's success in these new markets isn't guaranteed, and the news doesn't present any immediate threat to Apple's core business or financial performance.  The probability of a stock price rise or fall is therefore mostly dependent on other market factors and not significantly influenced by this specific news.  A slightly higher probability of no change is implied.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a 4.1% drop in Apple's stock price due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence on consumer demand. The downgrades and lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. Given the negative sentiment, weak guidance, and high valuation (36x earnings), the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. However, Loop Capital's optimism about long-term growth and AI potential provides some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. The analyst, Ben Bajarin, mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. This downgrade and cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses how Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in General Motors, but the author believes this decision was wrong. The company has been performing well, with resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share, especially in electric vehicles. Additionally, the company is aggressively using excess capital to buy back shares, which has positively impacted the stock price. Given this information, it seems the news is actually about General Motors (GM) and not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), but since AAPL is mentioned as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, there might be a slight indirect implication. However, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook, not AAPL's. Therefore, the reasoning for AAPL's stock price movement is indirect and not strongly influenced by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by Loop Capital and Jefferies due to significantly weakened iPhone sales, particularly in China, underscore a deteriorating outlook for Apple. The downgrades reflect lower expectations for future earnings and potential disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter, leading to increased bearish sentiment. Furthermore, a majority of analysts still hold a buy rating, but the overall downward trend in stock price and market capitalization suggests that investor confidence has been shaken. Therefore, the probabilities indicate a high likelihood of further declines in the stock price in the near term, amid ongoing investor concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The consensus from previous rounds heavily leans towards a negative outlook for Apple's stock. The news article details downgrades from two firms citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and skepticism about the impact of Apple's AI initiatives. The company's struggles in China, compounded by competition and slower economic growth, are significant concerns. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential catalysts, they seem unlikely to offset immediate pressures. The previous predictions reflect this negative sentiment. Given the continued emphasis on these problems in this round's news, I expect the short-term pressure on the stock to continue outweighing any positive impacts from other developments.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, which is a competitive threat to Apple in the long term. However, the news is not directly about Apple and does not contain any immediate negative or positive information about Apple's financial performance or products.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and minor.  Considering previous predictions largely focused on negative Apple-specific news (downgrades, weak sales), and this news is comparatively neutral, the probability of a stock price movement associated with this news is low. The influence of this news alone is likely to be overshadowed by other market factors and pre-existing sentiment around Apple.  Therefore, the probabilities lean towards a relatively unchanged stock price, with slightly higher odds of no movement than either a rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by two major analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence. These downgrades and the lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. The high valuation (36x earnings) and weak guidance further exacerbate the negative sentiment. While Loop Capital maintains some optimism about long-term growth, the immediate concerns dominate the market outlook. Given the overwhelming negative sentiment and the stock's recent decline, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. Analyst Ben Bajarin mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. These downgrades and the cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term. The consensus among multiple predictions is that the stock price has a higher probability of falling than rising due to the negative sentiment and weak guidance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors stock, but the author believes this decision was wrong due to GM's resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share.

However, considering the overall market sentiment and previous predictions, which indicated a bearish outlook for Apple due to disappointing iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, the probability of the stock price falling might still be slightly higher than rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum. Previous predictions also indicate a consistent bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts from Jefferies and Loop Capital highlight significant concerns regarding iPhone sales, particularly in the critical China market. The overall sentiment around Apple has turned bearish, with weak sales data prompting a negative outlook. The consensus among analysts has shifted, indicating potential disappointing earnings, further amplifying fears regarding the company's short-term growth prospects. While some analysts hold optimistic views for the long term, the immediate forecasts are clear, leading to a higher probability of price decline. Given these factors, the probabilities suggest a significant likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The consistent downgrades from multiple analysts (Jefferies, Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales (especially in China) and concerns about the impact of AI continue to pressure Apple's stock. The stock already fell 3.7% on Tuesday in response to the news. Prior round analyses and predictions heavily favor a negative outlook. The new iPhone SE mentioned is not considered a strong enough catalyst to reverse the downward trend in the very near term. Therefore, negative pressure will continue to outweigh potential positive catalysts. Given the convergence among the previous models, and the continuation of the negative narratives, I am keeping the probabilities in line with the previous round's general consensus.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, which is a competitive threat to Apple, but the impact is likely to be indirect and long-term.  The news itself doesn't provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or immediate prospects.  The previous predictions heavily favor a negative outlook for Apple due to concerns about weak iPhone sales (especially in China), analyst downgrades, and skepticism about the short-term impact of Apple's AI initiatives.  This negative sentiment is significantly more influential than the relatively neutral news about Meta's product expansion.  Therefore, while Meta's moves present a future competitive threat, the existing negative sentiment surrounding Apple's financial performance currently dominates the factors influencing the stock price. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore low, with a much higher probability of a continued price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including downgrades by two major analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence.
