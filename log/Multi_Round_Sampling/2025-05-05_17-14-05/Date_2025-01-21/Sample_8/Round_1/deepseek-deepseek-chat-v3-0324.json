(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today\nNews Content: Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to soft iPhone sales and concerns about consumer demand, especially in China, have weakened market sentiment around Apple Inc. The drop of 3.2% on Tuesday and the overall trend of a significant decline (11% in January) suggest that there is a negative outlook among investors. Given that two prominent analysts have expressed bearish sentiment and that the consensus buy rating has declined, it\u2019s reasonable to predict a higher probability of further decline than an increase in stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), declining market share, and a lack of investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives, all point towards potential downward pressure on the stock price. The specific mentions of reduced revenue forecasts and the underperformance of Apple's stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further solidify this bearish outlook. While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential positive catalysts, they are presented as possibilities rather than certainties and are unlikely to immediately offset the current negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% on the news emphasizes the market's concern. Earnings are slated to be released soon, which could provide additional insight into the actual performance of the company in the last quarter. However, the current projections, given the analyst downgrades, suggest disappointing results.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's existing product lines (smartwatches and AirPods).  While Meta's advancements in AR/VR are noteworthy, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small. Meta's success in these new markets isn't guaranteed, and the news doesn't present any immediate threat to Apple's core business or financial performance.  The probability of a stock price rise or fall is therefore mostly dependent on other market factors and not significantly influenced by this specific news.  A slightly higher probability of no change is implied.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a 4.1% drop in Apple's stock price due to downgrades by two Wall Street analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital), citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter, particularly in China, and skepticism around the immediate impact of Apple Intelligence on consumer demand. The downgrades and lowered price targets reflect concerns over near-term performance and delayed AI benefits. Given the negative sentiment, weak guidance, and high valuation (36x earnings), the market is likely to react negatively in the short term. However, Loop Capital's optimism about long-term growth and AI potential provides some counterbalance, though not enough to outweigh the immediate concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Wall Street firms, such as Loop Capital and Jefferies, have downgraded Apple's stock due to slowing growth in China. The analyst, Ben Bajarin, mentions that while Apple dominates the premium price tier in China, there is uncertainty about future growth in the region. He also notes that the AI story is still in its early stages and that a hardware cycle is needed to excite investors again. This downgrade and cautious outlook are likely to negatively impact the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses how Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in General Motors, but the author believes this decision was wrong. The company has been performing well, with resilient business, strong earnings, and increasing market share, especially in electric vehicles. Additionally, the company is aggressively using excess capital to buy back shares, which has positively impacted the stock price. Given this information, it seems the news is actually about General Motors (GM) and not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), but since AAPL is mentioned as one of the stocks Buffett has been a net seller of, there might be a slight indirect implication. However, the main focus is on GM's positive outlook, not AAPL's. Therefore, the reasoning for AAPL's stock price movement is indirect and not strongly influenced by this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
