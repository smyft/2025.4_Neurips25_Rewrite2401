(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple TV+ Expands Streaming Dominance with $200 Million Success of 'Severance' Season 1\"\nNews Content: With its first season producing over $200 million, Apple TV+ series Severance has become a major income source for the streaming platform. Data published by Deadline and derived from Parrot Analytics shows that this performance beats the $184.8 million generated by Slow Horses but behind the $299.4 million pulled in by The Morning Show.\n\nLast Friday's launch episode of the second season highlights Apple's ongoing attempts to establish Severance as a flagship show that goes with its premium brand. Parrot Analytics credits its weekly release schedulewhich promotes rewatching and catch-up viewing even after the season finalefor the show's consistent income generating.\n\nApple is also hinting to Ted Lasso maybe having a fourth season. With more than $600 million in income throughout its three-year run, the blockbuster comedy series has become pillar of the platform.\n\nUsing its own Content Valuation approach, Parrot Analyticsa company focused on audience measurement and performance analysis for entertainment contentestimates the income effect of individual titles across certain geographies. This approach assesses a show's income contribution over a certain period, therefore providing information on its worth for streaming services.\n\nApple (AAPL, Financials) has not revealed particular financial information for its streaming operation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses how tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, are engaging with President Trump after a history of tension, which could lead to more favorable conditions for tech companies including potential regulatory relief and investment incentives. This sentiment is generally positive for the tech sector, and as cybersecurity stocks perform well, it suggests an optimistic outlook for tech companies. However, there is uncertainty in the market, and any potential fallout from this engagement, including political missteps or public backlash, could negatively impact stock prices. Overall, the sentiment appears positive, but with a degree of cautious optimism due to potential external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Meta is planning to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which will compete directly with Apple's products like Apple Watch and AirPods. While this shows Meta's ambition to become an AI innovator, it also represents a significant competitive threat to Apple's existing product lines. The news mentions Apple is also exploring cameras on earbuds, meaning they face similar hurdles, however Meta is coming from behind to compete for Apple's customer base. This additional competition, albeit years out, may potentially erode Apple's market share and margins. Although Apple is working on new products as well, the headline and article focuses on Meta's competitive endeavors and their impact on already-existing Apple products.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock, driven primarily by disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, have downgraded Apple's rating, citing weak current trends and concerns about the impact of the Chinese market slowdown and the uncertain success of AI-related upgrades.  While Loop Capital maintains some long-term optimism, the immediate concerns about near-term sales performance and the high P/E ratio suggest a higher probability of a price decline. The news itself caused a 4.1% drop in the stock price on the day of the release. The promotional material at the end of the article is irrelevant to the analysis of the actual financial news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several key concerns about Apple's stock performance leading up to its Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings report on Jan. 30. The article points out stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings). Analysts have modest expectations (3.9% sales growth, 7.8% EPS growth), and the article suggests that even a 'blowout quarter' may not move the stock significantly due to high expectations. The overall sentiment is cautious, with the author advising against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and purchased call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and a positive sentiment towards Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. The article also mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities. Nevertheless, the impact of this news on the stock prices is uncertain and may be limited. Given the information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance'. This strong performance indicates a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business, which is a critical component of its services segment. Additionally, hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season, further suggest continued growth and engagement on Apple TV+. Such developments are likely to boost investor confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses increased engagement between tech leaders, including Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and President Trump. This could indicate potential regulatory relief and investment incentives for the tech sector, which is generally positive for Apple. Additionally, a thriving cybersecurity sector, which could benefit Apple indirectly, suggests a favorable outlook. Previous predictions reflect a mixed sentiment among analysts, with some highlighting external challenges such as competitive threats and market volatility. However, the overall sentiment from this news leans towards optimism regarding favorable conditions for tech companies, leading to a higher probability of stock price increases despite underlying concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's efforts to compete with Apple in the wearables market (smart glasses, watches, earbuds). This competition is a long-term concern for Apple as Meta attempts to gain market share in areas where Apple is currently a leader. Although the news suggests that Apple is exploring cameras in earbuds as well, the primary focus of the news is on Meta's advancements and potential disruptive impact. This introduces uncertainty regarding Apple's future market share and profitability. Given the previous round's negative predictions about AAPL stock with the average being a rise of 0.38 and fall of 0.62, and considering the additional competition from Meta, I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Because one model gave an extremely high rise of 0.75 when the other 5 models (excluding the one that failed) gave values less than 0.5, there is an indication that the models may be affected by information that is not in the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple's short-term prospects. Two analysts have downgraded their ratings, citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The concerns regarding the impact of a slowing Chinese economy and the uncertain success of AI-driven upgrades further contribute to a pessimistic outlook. While there's some long-term optimism about Apple's potential in AI, the immediate concerns outweigh any future potential. The 4.1% drop on the day of the news release reflects the market's immediate reaction.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a price fall, aligning with the current negative news.  Considering the significant negative factors presented and the immediate market reaction, the probability of a price fall is substantially higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's stock performance, including stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings). Analysts have modest expectations for the upcoming earnings report (3.9% sales growth, 7.8% EPS growth), and the article suggests that even a 'blowout quarter' may not significantly move the stock due to high expectations. The overall sentiment is cautious, with the author advising against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a higher chance of decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office' suggests a generally positive market sentiment. However, it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or provide any company-specific information that could directly influence Apple's stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple, the market's overall positive movement could be seen as a mildly positive indicator for Apple's stock. Additionally, previous predictions show a mixed sentiment with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, but none provide a clear, strong signal based on specific news about Apple. Therefore, considering the general positive market trend and the absence of negative news about Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and purchased call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), which could potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price. However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. Additionally, the article mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities. Nevertheless, the impact of this news on the stock prices is uncertain and may be limited. Given the information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance', and hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season. These developments indicate a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business. This positive development aligns with increasing confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, which historically has contributed positively to its stock price. The recent predictions from various models, especially the latest one supporting a rise, also suggest a bullish outlook. However, it is important to maintain caution as the tech sector can be volatile and subject to other macroeconomic factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights increased engagement between tech leaders and President Trump, which could create favorable conditions for tech companies like Apple. The commentary around a potentially revitalized cybersecurity sector could indirectly benefit Apple, suggesting a positive outlook. However, significant concerns regarding competition from Meta, weak iPhone sales disclosures, and high expectations ahead of Apple's upcoming earnings report linger, leading to a more cautious sentiment. Previous predictions reflect a range of views, with a slight bias towards a price decline amid competitive threats and market challenges. Overall, while there are positive angles, the persistent concerns outweigh them, leading to a modestly bullish outlook but with a notable risk of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's planned product releases competing with Apple's wearables (watches, earbuds). This poses a competitive threat to Apple and could erode market share. However, Meta has struggled for consumer acceptance in the AR/VR space, and there's no guarantee of success. The previous rounds of predictions had varied results, but leaned slightly toward negative sentiment regarding Apple stock. Given Meta's track record and the long lead time until these products appear, it is a moderate long-term concern, but has an uncertain short-term effect. Considering the previous bias to negative sentiment, and the moderately negative news this round, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the price going down. Also, there seems to be some outlier predictions in the past rounds that indicates that there are some hidden information that the models have access to which is not present in the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple's short-term prospects.  Two analysts downgraded their ratings, citing disappointing iPhone sales, particularly a significant decline in China. Concerns about a slowing Chinese economy and uncertain AI-driven upgrade cycle add to the pessimism.  While some long-term optimism regarding Apple's AI potential exists, the immediate negative factors significantly outweigh this. The 4.1% drop on the news release day reflects the market's immediate negative reaction.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a price fall, reinforcing the negative sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is substantially higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's stock performance, including stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings).

Considering the general positive market trend and the absence of negative news about Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news discusses Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares and her purchase of call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), which could potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price. However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. Additionally, the article mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities.

(AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance', and hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season. These developments indicate a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business. Historically, successful streaming service performances have positively influenced Apple's stock price. However, it is important to consider that the overall tech sector can be volatile and subject to other macroeconomic factors. The previous predictions showed a mix of sentiments, with some models indicating a positive outlook and others suggesting a negative outlook. Given the successful performance of Apple TV+, the probability of the stock price rising is weighted higher.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates a mix of factors affecting Apple's stock. Engagement between tech leaders and President Trump could lead to favorable conditions and regulatory relief for tech companies, including Apple. Additionally, the optimism surrounding the cybersecurity market may indirectly benefit Apple. However, there are significant concerns about competition from Meta, particularly in wearables, and ongoing issues like weak iPhone sales, especially in China. Analysts have voiced worries about Apple's near-term prospects ahead of its earnings report. Given these contrasting factors, the overall sentiment leans toward cautious optimism, but with risks persisting, leading to a roughly balanced probability for both rising and falling prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's plans to compete with Apple in the wearables market, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds. This competition could potentially erode Apple's market share, especially in the long term. However, Meta's track record in the AR/VR space is not consistently successful, and consumer acceptance of these new Meta products is not guaranteed. While this news is a valid competitive threat for Apple, it does not point to an immediate negative impact on the stock price. \n\nConsidering previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight lean towards negative sentiment regarding Apple stock, possibly due to analyst downgrades and other factors not directly related to this Meta news. Also, some predicted that other information that may not be present in the provided news may affect the predictions. Given these factors, I believe the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative, focusing on disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China, and analyst downgrades.  Jefferies and Loop Capital lowered their ratings and price targets, citing weakening trends and concerns about the impact of the Chinese market slowdown and the uncertain success of AI-related upgrades.  While some analysts retain long-term optimism, the short-term outlook is overwhelmingly bearish. The immediate 4.1% drop reflects this sentiment. Although some previous predictions showed a more optimistic view, the weight of evidence in this particular news strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall.  The promotional material at the end of the article is disregarded as it's irrelevant to the financial news analysis.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's stock performance, including stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings).
