While the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or its stock performance, it suggests a positive overall market trend. Generally, when the broader market is performing well, individual stocks like AAPL tend to benefit. However, without specific information about Apple's performance or reaction to Trump's presidency, we must infer based on the general market trend. The news does not provide direct insight into Apple's products, sales, or any company-specific developments that would significantly impact its stock price. Therefore, assuming Apple's stock price movement will largely follow the general market trend described, there's a higher likelihood of the stock price rising compared to falling, but with caution due to the lack of company-specific information.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4,\n}\n```"
