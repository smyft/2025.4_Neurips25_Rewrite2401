      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses how tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, are engaging with President Trump after a history of tension, which could lead to more favorable conditions for tech companies including potential regulatory relief and investment incentives. This sentiment is generally positive for the tech sector, and as cybersecurity stocks perform well, it suggests an optimistic outlook for tech companies. However, there is uncertainty in the market, and any potential fallout from this engagement, including political missteps or public backlash, could negatively impact stock prices. Overall, the sentiment appears positive, but with a degree of cautious optimism due to potential external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Meta is planning to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which will compete directly with Apple's products like Apple Watch and AirPods. While this shows Meta's ambition to become an AI innovator, it also represents a significant competitive threat to Apple's existing product lines. The news mentions Apple is also exploring cameras on earbuds, meaning they face similar hurdles, however Meta is coming from behind to compete for Apple's customer base. This additional competition, albeit years out, may potentially erode Apple's market share and margins. Although Apple is working on new products as well, the headline and article focuses on Meta's competitive endeavors and their impact on already-existing Apple products.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock, driven primarily by disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, have downgraded Apple's rating, citing weak current trends and concerns about the impact of the Chinese market slowdown and the uncertain success of AI-related upgrades.  While Loop Capital maintains some long-term optimism, the immediate concerns about near-term sales performance and the high P/E ratio suggest a higher probability of a price decline. The news itself caused a 4.1% drop in the stock price on the day of the release. The promotional material at the end of the article is irrelevant to the analysis of the actual financial news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several key concerns about Apple's stock performance leading up to its Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings report on Jan. 30. The article points out stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings). Analysts have modest expectations (3.9% sales growth, 7.8% EPS growth), and the article suggests that even a 'blowout quarter' may not move the stock significantly due to high expectations. The overall sentiment is cautious, with the author advising against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and purchased call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and a positive sentiment towards Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. The article also mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities. Nevertheless, the impact of this news on the stock prices is uncertain and may be limited. Given the information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance'. This strong performance indicates a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business, which is a critical component of its services segment. Additionally, hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season, further suggest continued growth and engagement on Apple TV+. Such developments are likely to boost investor confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses increased engagement between tech leaders, including Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and President Trump. This could indicate potential regulatory relief and investment incentives for the tech sector, which is generally positive for Apple. Additionally, a thriving cybersecurity sector, which could benefit Apple indirectly, suggests a favorable outlook. Previous predictions reflect a mixed sentiment among analysts, with some highlighting external challenges such as competitive threats and market volatility. However, the overall sentiment from this news leans towards optimism regarding favorable conditions for tech companies, leading to a higher probability of stock price increases despite underlying concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's efforts to compete with Apple in the wearables market (smart glasses, watches, earbuds). This competition is a long-term concern for Apple as Meta attempts to gain market share in areas where Apple is currently a leader. Although the news suggests that Apple is exploring cameras in earbuds as well, the primary focus of the news is on Meta's advancements and potential disruptive impact. This introduces uncertainty regarding Apple's future market share and profitability. Given the previous round's negative predictions about AAPL stock with the average being a rise of 0.38 and fall of 0.62, and considering the additional competition from Meta, I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Because one model gave an extremely high rise of 0.75 when the other 5 models (excluding the one that failed) gave values less than 0.5, there is an indication that the models may be affected by information that is not in the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple's short-term prospects. Two analysts have downgraded their ratings, citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The concerns regarding the impact of a slowing Chinese economy and the uncertain success of AI-driven upgrades further contribute to a pessimistic outlook. While there's some long-term optimism about Apple's potential in AI, the immediate concerns outweigh any future potential. The 4.1% drop on the day of the news release reflects the market's immediate reaction.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a price fall, aligning with the current negative news.  Considering the significant negative factors presented and the immediate market reaction, the probability of a price fall is substantially higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's stock performance, including stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings). Analysts have modest expectations for the upcoming earnings report (3.9% sales growth, 7.8% EPS growth), and the article suggests that even a 'blowout quarter' may not significantly move the stock due to high expectations. The overall sentiment is cautious, with the author advising against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a higher chance of decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office' suggests a generally positive market sentiment. However, it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or provide any company-specific information that could directly influence Apple's stock price. Given the lack of specific information about Apple, the market's overall positive movement could be seen as a mildly positive indicator for Apple's stock. Additionally, previous predictions show a mixed sentiment with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, but none provide a clear, strong signal based on specific news about Apple. Therefore, considering the general positive market trend and the absence of negative news about Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and purchased call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), which could potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price. However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. Additionally, the article mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities. Nevertheless, the impact of this news on the stock prices is uncertain and may be limited. Given the information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance', and hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season. These developments indicate a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business. This positive development aligns with increasing confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, which historically has contributed positively to its stock price. The recent predictions from various models, especially the latest one supporting a rise, also suggest a bullish outlook. However, it is important to maintain caution as the tech sector can be volatile and subject to other macroeconomic factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights increased engagement between tech leaders and President Trump, which could create favorable conditions for tech companies like Apple. The commentary around a potentially revitalized cybersecurity sector could indirectly benefit Apple, suggesting a positive outlook. However, significant concerns regarding competition from Meta, weak iPhone sales disclosures, and high expectations ahead of Apple's upcoming earnings report linger, leading to a more cautious sentiment. Previous predictions reflect a range of views, with a slight bias towards a price decline amid competitive threats and market challenges. Overall, while there are positive angles, the persistent concerns outweigh them, leading to a modestly bullish outlook but with a notable risk of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's planned product releases competing with Apple's wearables (watches, earbuds). This poses a competitive threat to Apple and could erode market share. However, Meta has struggled for consumer acceptance in the AR/VR space, and there's no guarantee of success. The previous rounds of predictions had varied results, but leaned slightly toward negative sentiment regarding Apple stock. Given Meta's track record and the long lead time until these products appear, it is a moderate long-term concern, but has an uncertain short-term effect. Considering the previous bias to negative sentiment, and the moderately negative news this round, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to the price going down. Also, there seems to be some outlier predictions in the past rounds that indicates that there are some hidden information that the models have access to which is not present in the news article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple's short-term prospects.  Two analysts downgraded their ratings, citing disappointing iPhone sales, particularly a significant decline in China. Concerns about a slowing Chinese economy and uncertain AI-driven upgrade cycle add to the pessimism.  While some long-term optimism regarding Apple's AI potential exists, the immediate negative factors significantly outweigh this. The 4.1% drop on the news release day reflects the market's immediate negative reaction.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a price fall, reinforcing the negative sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is substantially higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several concerns about Apple's stock performance, including stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings).
