(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge. Despite the injury, her investment activities have remained active.\n\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\n\nWhy It Matters: The trades have drawn attention following reports that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, outperforming most hedge funds and even the popular Inverse Cramer Stock Tracker. The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock sales that preceded a Department of Justice lawsuit against the company. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson has consistently maintained that all trades comply with federal disclosure requirements under the STOCK Act.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses how tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, are engaging with President Trump after a history of tension, which could lead to more favorable conditions for tech companies including potential regulatory relief and investment incentives. This sentiment is generally positive for the tech sector, and as cybersecurity stocks perform well, it suggests an optimistic outlook for tech companies. However, there is uncertainty in the market, and any potential fallout from this engagement, including political missteps or public backlash, could negatively impact stock prices. Overall, the sentiment appears positive, but with a degree of cautious optimism due to potential external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Meta is planning to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which will compete directly with Apple's products like Apple Watch and AirPods. While this shows Meta's ambition to become an AI innovator, it also represents a significant competitive threat to Apple's existing product lines. The news mentions Apple is also exploring cameras on earbuds, meaning they face similar hurdles, however Meta is coming from behind to compete for Apple's customer base. This additional competition, albeit years out, may potentially erode Apple's market share and margins. Although Apple is working on new products as well, the headline and article focuses on Meta's competitive endeavors and their impact on already-existing Apple products.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock, driven primarily by disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, have downgraded Apple's rating, citing weak current trends and concerns about the impact of the Chinese market slowdown and the uncertain success of AI-related upgrades.  While Loop Capital maintains some long-term optimism, the immediate concerns about near-term sales performance and the high P/E ratio suggest a higher probability of a price decline. The news itself caused a 4.1% drop in the stock price on the day of the release. The promotional material at the end of the article is irrelevant to the analysis of the actual financial news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several key concerns about Apple's stock performance leading up to its Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings report on Jan. 30. The article points out stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings). Analysts have modest expectations (3.9% sales growth, 7.8% EPS growth), and the article suggests that even a 'blowout quarter' may not move the stock significantly due to high expectations. The overall sentiment is cautious, with the author advising against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and purchased call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and a positive sentiment towards Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. The article also mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities. Nevertheless, the impact of this news on the stock prices is uncertain and may be limited. Given the information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance'. This strong performance indicates a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business, which is a critical component of its services segment. Additionally, hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season, further suggest continued growth and engagement on Apple TV+. Such developments are likely to boost investor confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
