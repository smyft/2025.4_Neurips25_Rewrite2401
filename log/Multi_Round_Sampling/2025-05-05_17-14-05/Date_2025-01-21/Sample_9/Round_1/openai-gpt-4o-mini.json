(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Cloudflare CEO on why Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech leaders are bending to Trump\nNews Content: Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses how tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, are engaging with President Trump after a history of tension, which could lead to more favorable conditions for tech companies including potential regulatory relief and investment incentives. This sentiment is generally positive for the tech sector, and as cybersecurity stocks perform well, it suggests an optimistic outlook for tech companies. However, there is uncertainty in the market, and any potential fallout from this engagement, including political missteps or public backlash, could negatively impact stock prices. Overall, the sentiment appears positive, but with a degree of cautious optimism due to potential external factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Meta is planning to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which will compete directly with Apple's products like Apple Watch and AirPods. While this shows Meta's ambition to become an AI innovator, it also represents a significant competitive threat to Apple's existing product lines. The news mentions Apple is also exploring cameras on earbuds, meaning they face similar hurdles, however Meta is coming from behind to compete for Apple's customer base. This additional competition, albeit years out, may potentially erode Apple's market share and margins. Although Apple is working on new products as well, the headline and article focuses on Meta's competitive endeavors and their impact on already-existing Apple products.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a negative outlook for Apple's stock, driven primarily by disappointing iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, have downgraded Apple's rating, citing weak current trends and concerns about the impact of the Chinese market slowdown and the uncertain success of AI-related upgrades.  While Loop Capital maintains some long-term optimism, the immediate concerns about near-term sales performance and the high P/E ratio suggest a higher probability of a price decline. The news itself caused a 4.1% drop in the stock price on the day of the release. The promotional material at the end of the article is irrelevant to the analysis of the actual financial news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several key concerns about Apple's stock performance leading up to its Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings report on Jan. 30. The article points out stagnant revenue growth, diminishing effectiveness of share buybacks, and high valuation metrics (32x forward earnings). Analysts have modest expectations (3.9% sales growth, 7.8% EPS growth), and the article suggests that even a 'blowout quarter' may not move the stock significantly due to high expectations. The overall sentiment is cautious, with the author advising against buying Apple stock before the earnings report. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise appears lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has sold her shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and purchased call options in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). This trading activity may be perceived as a negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and a positive sentiment towards Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). However, it is essential to consider that Pelosi's trades are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the companies' future performance. The article also mentions that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, which may have attracted attention to her trading activities. Nevertheless, the impact of this news on the stock prices is uncertain and may be limited. Given the information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) falling is slightly higher than the probability of rising, due to the potential negative perception of Pelosi's sale.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant success for Apple TV+, as exemplified by the high revenue from the show 'Severance'. This strong performance indicates a positive impact on Apple\u2019s streaming business, which is a critical component of its services segment. Additionally, hints of another popular show, Ted Lasso, having a fourth season, further suggest continued growth and engagement on Apple TV+. Such developments are likely to boost investor confidence in Apple\u2019s strategic direction for its services sector, potentially driving up the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
