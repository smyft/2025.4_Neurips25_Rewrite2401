(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which represents a major market for Apple. The company has also faced downgrades from two banks, indicating a lack of confidence in its future sales performance. Furthermore, concerns about the effectiveness of Apple's AI innovations contribute to a negative outlook. Given these factors, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling based on the negative sentiment surrounding the company's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates positive developments for Apple's streaming service, Apple TV+. The success of 'Severance' (generating $200 million) and the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' (generating $600 million) suggest growing revenue streams and increased subscriber attraction for the platform. This positive sentiment is slightly tempered by the comparison of 'Severance' to 'The Morning Show,' implying room for growth. While Apple doesn't disclose specific financials for its streaming operations, the overall indication is one of expansion and success, which is generally favorable for the stock. Considering Apple's massive market capitalization, the impact of Apple TV+'s revenue is likely incremental and not immediately decisive on overall stock performance. Also, the article's appearance on GuruFocus suggests it's already been somewhat disseminated, reducing the likelihood of a significant surprise. However, the continued success of the streaming service reinforces the company's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights a Wall Street analyst's prediction of a 41% upside for Apple (AAPL) by 2025, driven by AI integration, services growth, and a strong capital return program. However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett recently significantly reduced Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, citing Apple's high valuation.  This conflicting information creates uncertainty. While the positive outlook from the analyst suggests potential for price increase, Buffett's actions signal a more cautious stance. Considering both perspectives, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, while the probability of a fall or stagnation is also significant. The probability estimates are not solely based on this news piece, as many other factors influence stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the financial performance of 'Severance' Season 1 generating over $200 million, which is a strong indicator of the streaming platform's growth and potential to contribute positively to Apple's overall revenue. The mention of other successful shows like 'Ted Lasso' and 'The Morning Show' further reinforces the strength of Apple's content portfolio. While Apple has not disclosed specific financials for its streaming operation, the positive performance and strategic focus on premium content are likely to be viewed favorably by investors. Given that streaming services are a growing segment for Apple, this news could contribute to a positive sentiment around the stock. However, since Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors (e.g., iPhone sales, macroeconomic conditions), the impact of this single news item may be modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms Inc. planning to release new wearable devices such as Oakley-branded smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Meta's expansion into wearables and augmented reality (AR) directly competes with Apple's product lineup, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, Apple's established market presence and ecosystem might mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly relevant to Meta and its ambitions in wearables and AR, rather than a direct threat to Apple's core business. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, as investors might slightly adjust their expectations about Apple's competitive landscape.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to downgrades by two Wall Street sell-side analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter. The downgrades were driven by weak sales in China and concerns about the potential for a delayed AI-fueled upgrade cycle. Given this negative news, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' without providing specific details about the expected events or financial outcomes associated with this date. This type of headline commonly suggests an upcoming event, such as an earnings announcement or a product release. Given the ambiguity and lack of concrete information, it's challenging to predict a directional movement in Apple's stock price based solely on this headline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. The downgrades from two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, add to the negative sentiment, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. The analysis shows a trend of negative sentiment based on declining sales figures and perceived weaknesses in product strategy, particularly regarding AI. Given these factors, a higher probability of the stock price falling is justified.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' and potential for more from 'Ted Lasso.' This indicates growth in a revenue stream beyond hardware. While the impact of streaming on Apple's overall revenue is debated, positive trends support investor confidence. Considering previous rounds, opinions vary, with some focusing on potential negative factors. Given this positive streaming news, and acknowledging varied past beliefs, I slightly weight towards a stock price rise but not heavily. The probability of a rise is kept moderate due to Apple's size and the limited overall impact of streaming revenue alone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents conflicting signals regarding Apple's stock price movement.  A Wall Street analyst predicts a 41% upside by 2025, citing AI integration, services growth, and a strong capital return program. This is positive. However, Warren Buffett's significant reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple suggests a less optimistic view, given his value investing approach and Apple's high valuation.  This negative signal tempers the positive prediction.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock prices. While the analyst's prediction offers a bullish outlook, Buffett's actions and the lack of concrete near-term news in the provided article prevent a strong conclusion. Considering the conflicting information and the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock predictions, a relatively neutral probability distribution is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' generating $200 million and the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso', which has already brought in over $600 million. These developments indicate strong performance and growth in Apple's streaming service, a segment that contributes to its diversified revenue streams. While Apple does not disclose specific financials for its streaming operations, the positive performance and strategic focus on premium content are likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, given Apple's massive market capitalization, the impact of this news on the overall stock price may be modest. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, where some models leaned positive due to streaming success and others were cautious due to broader market factors, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore estimated to be higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms Inc. planning to release new wearable devices such as Oakley-branded smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds could potentially impact Apple's stock price.

Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, as investors might slightly adjust their expectations about Apple's competitive landscape.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing a 4.1% stock price drop due to downgrades from two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, who cited disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter. The downgrades were driven by weak sales in China and concerns about the potential for a delayed AI-fueled upgrade cycle. Additionally, the news mentions Apple's high valuation and the challenges it faces in executing its AI strategy. Considering the negative sentiment surrounding the company's performance, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' without providing specific details about the expected events or financial outcomes associated with this date. Most of the previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment among various models, ranging from optimistic to pessimistic. The latest predictions seem to lean towards a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling, influenced by factors like negative analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales. Considering the ambiguous nature of the headline and the mixed sentiments, a balanced estimate would place the probabilities roughly in the middle.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The recent news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a critical market for Apple. This has led to downgrades by two investment banks, reflecting a lack of confidence in Apple's short-term performance. The sentiment from these developments is primarily negative, especially considering the statistics showing an 18% fall in iPhone sales. While there are some positive notes regarding Apple's streaming service, the overall impact of the downgrades and poor sales data outweighs those positives. Thus, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance,' generating $200 million in revenue. This, coupled with the success of 'Ted Lasso,' points to the growing strength of Apple's streaming service. While Apple doesn't disclose specific financials for Apple TV+, positive developments in this sector are generally viewed favorably, indicating potential for revenue diversification. Previous predictions varied, highlighting both positive and negative signals surrounding Apple, showcasing earlier concerns about iPhone sales decline and analyst downgrades. Considering that this news particularly concerns streaming business, and previous analysts showcased increasing confidence based on recent news, there is an increased probability of stock price rise, but given the overall size of Apple and mixed sentiment from earlier weeks, this effect is expected to be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  A Wall Street analyst predicts a significant (41%) upside by 2025, driven by AI integration and services growth. This is a positive factor. However, Warren Buffett's substantial reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple holdings indicates a less optimistic view, suggesting concerns regarding Apple's high valuation.  This is a negative factor. The previous predictions are quite diverse, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock market predictions. While the analyst's projection offers a bullish long-term outlook, Buffett's actions and the lack of concrete near-term news in this article prevent a strong conclusion about short-term movement.  The conflicting information and the generally uncertain nature of short-term stock predictions lead to a moderate probability assigned to both a price rise and fall.  The long-term positive outlook is tempered by the immediate negative signal from Buffett's actions and the lack of any significantly new information in the news piece itself. I'm weighing the long-term positive prediction against the current negative market sentiment more heavily than previous models, which appear to have focused more on the long term possibilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' generating $200 million and the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso', which has already brought in over $600 million.

The news is more directly relevant to Meta and its ambitions in wearables and AR, rather than a direct threat to Apple's core business. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, where some models leaned positive due to Apple's strengths and others were cautious due to broader market factors and competition, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore estimated to be lower than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. The downgrades from two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, add to the negative sentiment, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. Additionally, concerns about the potential for a delayed AI-fueled upgrade cycle and Apple's high valuation contribute to the negative outlook. While Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact, the overall trend of negative sentiment and declining sales figures justify a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' without providing specific details about the expected events or financial outcomes associated with this date.
