(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today\nNews Content: Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which represents a major market for Apple. The company has also faced downgrades from two banks, indicating a lack of confidence in its future sales performance. Furthermore, concerns about the effectiveness of Apple's AI innovations contribute to a negative outlook. Given these factors, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price falling based on the negative sentiment surrounding the company's performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates positive developments for Apple's streaming service, Apple TV+. The success of 'Severance' (generating $200 million) and the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' (generating $600 million) suggest growing revenue streams and increased subscriber attraction for the platform. This positive sentiment is slightly tempered by the comparison of 'Severance' to 'The Morning Show,' implying room for growth. While Apple doesn't disclose specific financials for its streaming operations, the overall indication is one of expansion and success, which is generally favorable for the stock. Considering Apple's massive market capitalization, the impact of Apple TV+'s revenue is likely incremental and not immediately decisive on overall stock performance. Also, the article's appearance on GuruFocus suggests it's already been somewhat disseminated, reducing the likelihood of a significant surprise. However, the continued success of the streaming service reinforces the company's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights a Wall Street analyst's prediction of a 41% upside for Apple (AAPL) by 2025, driven by AI integration, services growth, and a strong capital return program. However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett recently significantly reduced Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, citing Apple's high valuation.  This conflicting information creates uncertainty. While the positive outlook from the analyst suggests potential for price increase, Buffett's actions signal a more cautious stance. Considering both perspectives, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, while the probability of a fall or stagnation is also significant. The probability estimates are not solely based on this news piece, as many other factors influence stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the financial performance of 'Severance' Season 1 generating over $200 million, which is a strong indicator of the streaming platform's growth and potential to contribute positively to Apple's overall revenue. The mention of other successful shows like 'Ted Lasso' and 'The Morning Show' further reinforces the strength of Apple's content portfolio. While Apple has not disclosed specific financials for its streaming operation, the positive performance and strategic focus on premium content are likely to be viewed favorably by investors. Given that streaming services are a growing segment for Apple, this news could contribute to a positive sentiment around the stock. However, since Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors (e.g., iPhone sales, macroeconomic conditions), the impact of this single news item may be modest.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms Inc. planning to release new wearable devices such as Oakley-branded smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Meta's expansion into wearables and augmented reality (AR) directly competes with Apple's product lineup, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, Apple's established market presence and ecosystem might mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly relevant to Meta and its ambitions in wearables and AR, rather than a direct threat to Apple's core business. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, as investors might slightly adjust their expectations about Apple's competitive landscape.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price fell 4.1% due to downgrades by two Wall Street sell-side analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter. The downgrades were driven by weak sales in China and concerns about the potential for a delayed AI-fueled upgrade cycle. Given this negative news, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' without providing specific details about the expected events or financial outcomes associated with this date. This type of headline commonly suggests an upcoming event, such as an earnings announcement or a product release. Given the ambiguity and lack of concrete information, it's challenging to predict a directional movement in Apple's stock price based solely on this headline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. The downgrades from two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, add to the negative sentiment, suggesting a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. The analysis shows a trend of negative sentiment based on declining sales figures and perceived weaknesses in product strategy, particularly regarding AI. Given these factors, a higher probability of the stock price falling is justified.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' and potential for more from 'Ted Lasso.' This indicates growth in a revenue stream beyond hardware. While the impact of streaming on Apple's overall revenue is debated, positive trends support investor confidence. Considering previous rounds, opinions vary, with some focusing on potential negative factors. Given this positive streaming news, and acknowledging varied past beliefs, I slightly weight towards a stock price rise but not heavily. The probability of a rise is kept moderate due to Apple's size and the limited overall impact of streaming revenue alone.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents conflicting signals regarding Apple's stock price movement.  A Wall Street analyst predicts a 41% upside by 2025, citing AI integration, services growth, and a strong capital return program. This is positive. However, Warren Buffett's significant reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple suggests a less optimistic view, given his value investing approach and Apple's high valuation.  This negative signal tempers the positive prediction.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock prices. While the analyst's prediction offers a bullish outlook, Buffett's actions and the lack of concrete near-term news in the provided article prevent a strong conclusion. Considering the conflicting information and the uncertainty inherent in short-term stock predictions, a relatively neutral probability distribution is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with 'Severance' generating $200 million and the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso', which has already brought in over $600 million. These developments indicate strong performance and growth in Apple's streaming service, a segment that contributes to its diversified revenue streams. While Apple does not disclose specific financials for its streaming operations, the positive performance and strategic focus on premium content are likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, given Apple's massive market capitalization, the impact of this news on the overall stock price may be modest. Considering the mixed predictions from previous rounds, where some models leaned positive due to streaming success and others were cautious due to broader market factors, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore estimated to be higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms Inc. planning to release new wearable devices such as Oakley-branded smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds could potentially impact Apple's stock price. Meta's expansion into wearables and augmented reality (AR) directly competes with Apple's product lineup, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, Apple's established market presence and ecosystem might mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly relevant to Meta and its ambitions in wearables and AR, rather than a direct threat to Apple's core business. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, as investors might slightly adjust their expectations about Apple's competitive landscape.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) experiencing a 4.1% stock price drop due to downgrades from two Wall Street analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, who cited disappointing iPhone sales in the December quarter. The downgrades were driven by weak sales in China and concerns about the potential for a delayed AI-fueled upgrade cycle. Additionally, the news mentions Apple's high valuation and the challenges it faces in executing its AI strategy. Considering the negative sentiment surrounding the company's performance, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than the probability of it rising. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base may mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline asks 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' without providing specific details about the expected events or financial outcomes associated with this date. Most of the previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment among various models, ranging from optimistic to pessimistic. The latest predictions seem to lean towards a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling, influenced by factors like negative analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales. Considering the ambiguous nature of the headline and the mixed sentiments, a balanced estimate would place the probabilities roughly in the middle.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
