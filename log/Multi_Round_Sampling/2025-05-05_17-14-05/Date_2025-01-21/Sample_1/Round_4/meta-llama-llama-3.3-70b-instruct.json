(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in the critical China market, suggest a weakened outlook for Apple. The stock has already experienced a significant decline, reflecting investor concerns. With a consensus rating dropping and only 8.5% of analysts holding a bearish outlook, it reflects growing caution among analysts. Given the context of lower-than-expected sales trends and market reactions to the downgrades, the probability of a stock price fall is higher as negative sentiment typically influences trading following such news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses three stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio and highlights analyst price targets suggesting significant upside for each in 2025. While the overall tone toward Apple (AAPL) is positive due to AI integration and a strong services segment, several factors temper the potential for a dramatic rise solely based on this news. First, the implied upside of 41% is already factored into Wedbush analyst Dan Ives' price target, which the market may have already considered. Second, Buffett's recent selling of a significant portion of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests he finds the stock overvalued. This could act as a psychological barrier to a substantial price increase. Finally, the article focuses on analyst forecasts and not concrete company news. Therefore, while the news may provide some positive sentiment, the probability of a significant rise specifically due to this headline is balanced by these countervailing factors. I will assume the stock will either rise slightly or stay stable. The odds are better it will remain where it is or rise slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article also highlights Apple's long-term growth and mentions other investment opportunities, suggesting a more balanced perspective than solely focusing on the negative news. Considering these factors, a significant further drop seems unlikely, though some short-term downward pressure is plausible. The probability is weighted towards a continued downward trend in the short term, but not a drastic change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, concerns over slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecasts, and competitive pressures in key markets like China. Additionally, slower AI adoption and delays in advanced packaging for future iPhones further dampen growth prospects. The immediate market reaction shows a significant drop in Apple's stock price, indicating strong investor pessimism. Given these headwinds and the pre-earnings uncertainty, the probability of a further decline in stock price is elevated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, with an 18% drop in Q4 compared to the same period last year. This led to Apple losing its top spot in China to Huawei Technologies Co. Additionally, two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, downgraded Apple's stock rating. Jefferies cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales and concerns about the usefulness of Apple's AI technology, while Loop Capital predicted a significant drop in iPhone demand. Given these negative developments, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nvidia has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable public company, with Apple's shares falling by almost 4%. The downgrade of Apple's rating to 'Underperform' by Jefferies analysts, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance, and weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Additionally, the cautious stance on demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 and the decline in iPhone shipments also contribute to a bearish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's need for significant revenue growth and points out recent stagnation in its earnings. Analyst expectations for the upcoming quarter are not high, and even a good performance may not affect the stock positively given its current valuation. Moreover, the article suggests investing in other companies instead due to lower valuations and stronger growth potential.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies reflect growing concerns over Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market where sales have dropped significantly. The overall sentiment among analysts has turned more cautious, with the consensus rating dropping and a notable market reaction evidenced by a significant decline in stock price. Many factors indicate weaknesses in both demand and future revenue, placing downward pressure on the stock. While some analysts may still hold a positive view, the prevailing sentiment from the latest news heavily underscores bearish expectations. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, a Wall Street analyst (Dan Ives at Wedbush) has a bullish price target, implying a 41% upside, driven by AI integration and a thriving services segment. These are positive catalysts. On the other hand, the article also mentions that Buffett sold 67% of Berkshire's Apple stake, suggesting he sees the stock as overvalued, which tempers the bullish sentiment. The article is from January 2025 - it's now June 2024, so the price movement since January 2025 is unknown. Given the mixed signals and the significant weight Buffett's actions carry, I'm leaning slightly towards a neutral outcome, with a slight positive bias due to the analyst's optimism. Previous responses were negative so this could cause a correction. There's a potential over-correction from the previous rounds to the downside.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news presents a bearish outlook for Apple.  Two analyst downgrades, citing weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue, are significant negative factors.  The already substantial drop in the stock price (3.2%) reflects the market's initial reaction to this negative sentiment. While the article mentions Apple's long-term strength and volatility, the immediate impact of the negative news and analyst downgrades outweighs these factors in the short term.  The previous prediction round already incorporated the negative news about China sales, so this current news adds further downward pressure.  Considering the confluence of negative factors and the market's immediate negative response, a further price decline is more likely than a rise in the very short term.  However, given Apple's history of volatility and long-term value, the probability isn't extremely high for a continued fall, leaning moderately towards a drop but not a catastrophic one. The consensus from previous models leans heavily towards a fall, which reinforces this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, concerns over slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecasts, and competitive pressures in key markets like China. The immediate market reaction shows a significant drop in Apple's stock price, indicating strong investor pessimism. Given these headwinds and the pre-earnings uncertainty, the probability of a further decline in stock price is elevated. Previous predictions from other models also largely favor a downward trend, with most assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. The consensus among analysts and the market reaction to the news suggest a bearish outlook in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news reports a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, with an 18% drop in Q4 compared to the same period last year. This led to Apple losing its top spot in China to Huawei Technologies Co. Additionally, two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, downgraded Apple's stock rating. Jefferies cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales and concerns about the usefulness of Apple's AI technology, while Loop Capital predicted a significant drop in iPhone demand. Given these negative developments, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure. The consensus among multiple models suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Nvidia surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable public company, with Apple's shares falling by almost 4%. The downgrade of Apple's rating to 'Underperform' by Jefferies analysts, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance, and weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Additionally, the cautious stance on demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 and the decline in iPhone shipments also contribute to a bearish sentiment. Considering the previous predictions from various models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a need for significant revenue growth, expected low analyst estimates, and stagnant earnings growth. The article also suggests that the market is not optimistic about Apple's near-term performance, as indicated by the advice against buying stock before the earnings report. Previous predictions show a strong consensus that Apple's stock is likely to fall due to these factors. Despite the possibility of a good earnings report somewhat mitigating negative sentiment, the overall message suggests a higher probability of further declines.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies indicate increasing concerns over Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the important Chinese market where sales have reportedly dropped significantly. The overall sentiment is bearish, supported by a dramatic drop of 3.2% in Apple's share price, indicating strong market reaction to this pessimistic news. Analyst recommendations have shifted, with a lower consensus rating reflecting growing cautiousness about Apple's future revenue prospects. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising, as investor sentiment is heavily influenced by such analyst actions and sales performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This article presents a mixed, but overall slightly positive, perspective on Apple. A Wall Street analyst from Wedbush sets a price target implying a 41% upside based on AI implementation and a strong services segment. However, Warren Buffett selling a big portion of his Apple stake provides a strong negative counterpoint. Given the analyst's positive target is specifically for 2025, there may be a delayed positive effect if AI capabilities are successfully implemented and boost services revenue. The fact that Buffett, a value investor, trimmed his position suggests potential overvaluation. Considering prior round predictions were heavily tilted towards 'falling', a slight correction is possible, but I will weigh the analyst's optimism against Buffett's actions. The double down mentions of successes indicate the potential of increase, however, should be taken with a grain of salt. This leads to a cautiously balanced assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Two analyst downgrades, citing weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected revenue, are significant.  The already substantial 3.2% drop reflects the market's immediate reaction.  While Apple's long-term prospects and historical volatility are noted, the immediate impact of the negative news dominates.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple previous prediction rounds reinforces this view. Although the possibility of an overcorrection exists, the weight of evidence points toward a continued downward trend in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, concerns over slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecasts, and competitive pressures in key markets like China. The immediate market reaction shows a significant drop in Apple's stock price, indicating strong investor pessimism. Given these headwinds and the pre-earnings uncertainty, the probability of a further decline in stock price is elevated. Previous predictions from other models also largely favor a downward trend, with most assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. The consensus among analysts and the market reaction to the news suggest a bearish outlook in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent financial news indicates a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, downgrades from analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital, and concerns over the company's AI technology and future revenue growth. The consensus among multiple models suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Given these factors, including the 18% drop in iPhone sales in China and the downgrades from major analysts, the sentiment leans heavily towards a decline in stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports Apple's stock falling by almost 4% as Nvidia surpasses it as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform', citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance, and weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. The cautious stance on demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 and the decline in iPhone shipments also contribute to a bearish sentiment. Considering the previous predictions from various models and the overall negative news, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a need for significant revenue growth, expected low analyst estimates, and stagnant earnings growth. The article also suggests that the market is not optimistic about Apple's near-term performance, as indicated by the advice against buying stock before the earnings report. Previous predictions show a strong consensus that Apple's stock is likely to fall due to these factors. Despite the possibility of a good earnings report somewhat mitigating negative sentiment, the overall message suggests a higher probability of further declines.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades from two major analysts highlight significant concerns over Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the critical Chinese market, where sales have dramatically declined. The market's negative reaction to these downgrades is reflected in a 3.2% drop in shares, suggesting a strong bearish sentiment among investors. Furthermore, analyst consensus has shifted towards caution, indicating that future revenue expectations are dimming. Given these factors, including the fundamental challenges Apple faces with declining demand and increasing competition, the probability of a stock price fall is considerably higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article discusses three stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio and highlights analyst price targets suggesting significant upside for each in 2025. Specifically for Apple, a Wedbush analyst forecasts a 41% upside due to AI integration and a strong services segment. However, this positive view is counterbalanced by the fact that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently sold a significant portion of its Apple stake, implying that he might consider the stock overvalued. Given this mixed sentiment, and considering the delayed nature of the 2025 forecast and earlier negative predictions, I am increasing the probability of stock rise. The \"Double Down\" alert also adds potential positive signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two prominent analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, have downgraded Apple's stock, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  These downgrades are significant because they reflect a shift in professional opinion and often influence market sentiment.  The reported 3.2% drop already reflects the market's initial reaction to this negative news.  While Apple's long-term prospects and historical volatility are acknowledged, the immediate impact of the negative news and analyst downgrades significantly outweigh any positive factors in the short term. The consistent bearish predictions from previous models further reinforce this negative outlook.  While a short covering rally or an overreaction to the negative news is possible, the weight of evidence strongly suggests continued downward pressure in the near term. Therefore, the probability of a price drop is significantly higher than the probability of a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), driven by a Jefferies downgrade to Underperform, concerns over slowing iPhone demand, and weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecasts. Additional pressures include competitive challenges in China, slower AI adoption, and delays in advanced packaging for future iPhones. The immediate market reaction has been negative, with Apple's stock price already declining by 3.80%. Given the confluence of these factors and the bearish sentiment reflected in previous predictions, the probability of a further decline in stock price is elevated. While there is always potential for short-term volatility or a rebound, the weight of the negative news suggests a higher likelihood of continued downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, downgrades from analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital, and concerns over the company's AI technology and future revenue growth. Multiple models in previous rounds have consistently suggested a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. The consensus among analysts and the market reaction to the news suggest a bearish outlook in the short term. Given these factors, including the 18% drop in iPhone sales in China and the downgrades from major analysts, the sentiment leans heavily towards a decline in stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in Apple's stock price as Nvidia surpasses it as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform', citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance, and weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. The cautious stance on demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 and the decline in iPhone shipments also contribute to a bearish sentiment.
