(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why AAPL Stock Is Retreating Today\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) stock is sinking 4% after a research firm reported yesterday that sales of the company's iPhones in China had plunged last quarter. Meanwhile, two banks have downgraded the iPhone maker's shares recently.\n\nApple May Be Facing Major Problems in China\n\nThe number of iPhones handed over in China dove 18% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. As a consequence, China-based Huawei Technologies Co. took over the top spot in the Asian country from AAPL, and the American firm's market share has fallen to about one-sixth. Additionally, AAPL is now number three when it comes to smartphone sales in China.Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nTwo Banks Cut Their Ratings on AAPL\n\nInvestment bank Jefferies downgraded the firm to Underperform. The investment bank believes that AAPL has sold fewer iPhones than expected. Moreover, a survey found that American consumers do not believe that the company's AI is \"useful,\" Jefferies reported. As a result, the technology probably won't trigger a supercycle, the investment bank predicted, adding that the company's results for its March quarter may make the Street unhappy.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded AAPL to Hold. It predicts that the demand for Apple's iPhones will drop significantly during the current quarter before sinking much further over the subsequent six months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in the critical China market, suggest a weakened outlook for Apple. The stock has already experienced a significant decline, reflecting investor concerns. With a consensus rating dropping and only 8.5% of analysts holding a bearish outlook, it reflects growing caution among analysts. Given the context of lower-than-expected sales trends and market reactions to the downgrades, the probability of a stock price fall is higher as negative sentiment typically influences trading following such news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses three stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio and highlights analyst price targets suggesting significant upside for each in 2025. While the overall tone toward Apple (AAPL) is positive due to AI integration and a strong services segment, several factors temper the potential for a dramatic rise solely based on this news. First, the implied upside of 41% is already factored into Wedbush analyst Dan Ives' price target, which the market may have already considered. Second, Buffett's recent selling of a significant portion of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests he finds the stock overvalued. This could act as a psychological barrier to a substantial price increase. Finally, the article focuses on analyst forecasts and not concrete company news. Therefore, while the news may provide some positive sentiment, the probability of a significant rise specifically due to this headline is balanced by these countervailing factors. I will assume the stock will either rise slightly or stay stable. The odds are better it will remain where it is or rise slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article also highlights Apple's long-term growth and mentions other investment opportunities, suggesting a more balanced perspective than solely focusing on the negative news. Considering these factors, a significant further drop seems unlikely, though some short-term downward pressure is plausible. The probability is weighted towards a continued downward trend in the short term, but not a drastic change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, concerns over slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecasts, and competitive pressures in key markets like China. Additionally, slower AI adoption and delays in advanced packaging for future iPhones further dampen growth prospects. The immediate market reaction shows a significant drop in Apple's stock price, indicating strong investor pessimism. Given these headwinds and the pre-earnings uncertainty, the probability of a further decline in stock price is elevated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, with an 18% drop in Q4 compared to the same period last year. This led to Apple losing its top spot in China to Huawei Technologies Co. Additionally, two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, downgraded Apple's stock rating. Jefferies cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales and concerns about the usefulness of Apple's AI technology, while Loop Capital predicted a significant drop in iPhone demand. Given these negative developments, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nvidia has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable public company, with Apple's shares falling by almost 4%. The downgrade of Apple's rating to 'Underperform' by Jefferies analysts, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance, and weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Additionally, the cautious stance on demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 and the decline in iPhone shipments also contribute to a bearish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's need for significant revenue growth and points out recent stagnation in its earnings. Analyst expectations for the upcoming quarter are not high, and even a good performance may not affect the stock positively given its current valuation. Moreover, the article suggests investing in other companies instead due to lower valuations and stronger growth potential.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
