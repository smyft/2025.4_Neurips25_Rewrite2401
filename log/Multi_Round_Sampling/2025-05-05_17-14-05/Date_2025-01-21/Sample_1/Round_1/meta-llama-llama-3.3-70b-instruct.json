(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by analysts due to concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in the critical China market, suggest a weakened outlook for Apple. The stock has already experienced a significant decline, reflecting investor concerns. With a consensus rating dropping and only 8.5% of analysts holding a bearish outlook, it reflects growing caution among analysts. Given the context of lower-than-expected sales trends and market reactions to the downgrades, the probability of a stock price fall is higher as negative sentiment typically influences trading following such news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses three stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio and highlights analyst price targets suggesting significant upside for each in 2025. While the overall tone toward Apple (AAPL) is positive due to AI integration and a strong services segment, several factors temper the potential for a dramatic rise solely based on this news. First, the implied upside of 41% is already factored into Wedbush analyst Dan Ives' price target, which the market may have already considered. Second, Buffett's recent selling of a significant portion of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests he finds the stock overvalued. This could act as a psychological barrier to a substantial price increase. Finally, the article focuses on analyst forecasts and not concrete company news. Therefore, while the news may provide some positive sentiment, the probability of a significant rise specifically due to this headline is balanced by these countervailing factors. I will assume the stock will either rise slightly or stay stable. The odds are better it will remain where it is or rise slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports downgrades from two analyst firms, Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue.  This negative sentiment, coupled with the recent decline in Chinese iPhone shipments, suggests a bearish outlook. Although the market's reaction was significant (a 3.2% drop), the article notes that Apple's stock is volatile and the drop isn't necessarily a fundamental shift in market perception.  The article also highlights Apple's long-term growth and mentions other investment opportunities, suggesting a more balanced perspective than solely focusing on the negative news. Considering these factors, a significant further drop seems unlikely, though some short-term downward pressure is plausible. The probability is weighted towards a continued downward trend in the short term, but not a drastic change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies, concerns over slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecasts, and competitive pressures in key markets like China. Additionally, slower AI adoption and delays in advanced packaging for future iPhones further dampen growth prospects. The immediate market reaction shows a significant drop in Apple's stock price, indicating strong investor pessimism. Given these headwinds and the pre-earnings uncertainty, the probability of a further decline in stock price is elevated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, with an 18% drop in Q4 compared to the same period last year. This led to Apple losing its top spot in China to Huawei Technologies Co. Additionally, two banks, Jefferies and Loop Capital, downgraded Apple's stock rating. Jefferies cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales and concerns about the usefulness of Apple's AI technology, while Loop Capital predicted a significant drop in iPhone demand. Given these negative developments, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nvidia has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable public company, with Apple's shares falling by almost 4%. The downgrade of Apple's rating to 'Underperform' by Jefferies analysts, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance, and weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Additionally, the cautious stance on demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 and the decline in iPhone shipments also contribute to a bearish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's need for significant revenue growth and points out recent stagnation in its earnings. Analyst expectations for the upcoming quarter are not high, and even a good performance may not affect the stock positively given its current valuation. Moreover, the article suggests investing in other companies instead due to lower valuations and stronger growth potential.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
