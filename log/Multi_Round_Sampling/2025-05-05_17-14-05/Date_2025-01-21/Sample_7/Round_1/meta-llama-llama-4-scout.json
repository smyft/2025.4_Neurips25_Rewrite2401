(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Tumble 4% After Double Downgrades by Analysts\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financial) shares tumbled more than 4% on Tuesday after analysts across the board downgraded the stock, citing mounting worries about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services.\n\nApple was downgraded to underperform from hold by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. However, Lee said the downgrade reflected weakening demand for the iPhone, particularly in major foreign markets such as China. However, efforts to boost sales with new models, such as the budget-friendly iPhone SE, have not really gotten buy-in in an increasingly crowded smartphone market, which has raised doubts about revenue growth.\n\nLast week, Barclays also downgraded Apple to an underweight from an equal weight rating, warning of poor iPhone 15 sales and anticipating more of the same with the iPhone 16. It also long condemned Apple's product lineup as not innovative enough, which, he said, had dulled consumer interest and buying momentum.\n\nApple's hardware business, of course, extends beyond smartphones, and it also has headwinds. Declining sales of MacBooks and iPads were also a long pointer to bigger problems in the company's hardware arm, a historically lucrative revenue generator.\n\nGrowing skepticism of Apple's ability to keep its growth well intact in the face of changing market conditions led to these downgrades. Meanwhile, analysts remain wary of Apple's near-term performance as it grapples with intensifying competition and economic pressures, a selling factor in recent weakness.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may suggest uncertainty among investors and analysts regarding its future performance. However, without negative news, major shifts in market sentiment, or unfavorable earnings reports, the overall impression could be neutral. Given Apple's historical performance and strong brand loyalty, the potential for a rise remains plausible, while the uncertainty introduced by the question could also lead to a cautious outlook, resulting in some probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple (AAPL) stock. While the article doesn't explicitly state *why*, large sales by prominent figures can sometimes signal negative sentiment, potentially leading other investors to sell as well. However, the market reaction is also influenced by Apple's overall performance, market conditions, and other analyst reports. Pelosi's actions could be for portfolio diversification, personal financial needs, or other factors unrelated to Apple's future performance. Given that high-profile political figures usually get inside information, there's a slight lean towards predicting a fall. However, considering the limited standalone information and the size and stability of Apple as a company, it is not guaranteed.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline \"Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?\" is a question, not a statement of fact or a prediction.  It implies uncertainty about Apple's future performance, which is common in market analysis.  This headline alone does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, new products, or changes in its market position.  Therefore, it's unlikely to significantly influence the stock price in either direction immediately.  Any price movement would be based on broader market trends, investor sentiment unrelated to this headline, or pre-existing expectations about Apple.  I'll assume the probability of a price rise or fall is approximately equal, with a small probability reflecting some inherent market noise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including downgrades by two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a disappointing AI outlook. iPhone sales in China have declined, and overall market share has dropped. The AI platform's rollout has been slow and not well-received, impacting investor expectations. Additionally, the company's revenue growth estimates have been revised downward. These factors suggest negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and increasing competition. These factors have led to a 4% tumble in Apple shares. Given the overall negative sentiment and specific concerns about weakening demand and poor sales forecasts, it is logical to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' due to expectations of a miss in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, citing weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. Additionally, demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 is expected to be cautious, and iPhone shipments were down 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December. These negative factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
