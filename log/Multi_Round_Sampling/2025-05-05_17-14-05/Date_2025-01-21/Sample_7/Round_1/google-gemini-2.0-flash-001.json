(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge. Despite the injury, her investment activities have remained active.\n\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\n\nWhy It Matters: The trades have drawn attention following reports that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, outperforming most hedge funds and even the popular Inverse Cramer Stock Tracker. The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock sales that preceded a Department of Justice lawsuit against the company. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson has consistently maintained that all trades comply with federal disclosure requirements under the STOCK Act.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may suggest uncertainty among investors and analysts regarding its future performance. However, without negative news, major shifts in market sentiment, or unfavorable earnings reports, the overall impression could be neutral. Given Apple's historical performance and strong brand loyalty, the potential for a rise remains plausible, while the uncertainty introduced by the question could also lead to a cautious outlook, resulting in some probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple (AAPL) stock. While the article doesn't explicitly state *why*, large sales by prominent figures can sometimes signal negative sentiment, potentially leading other investors to sell as well. However, the market reaction is also influenced by Apple's overall performance, market conditions, and other analyst reports. Pelosi's actions could be for portfolio diversification, personal financial needs, or other factors unrelated to Apple's future performance. Given that high-profile political figures usually get inside information, there's a slight lean towards predicting a fall. However, considering the limited standalone information and the size and stability of Apple as a company, it is not guaranteed.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline \"Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?\" is a question, not a statement of fact or a prediction.  It implies uncertainty about Apple's future performance, which is common in market analysis.  This headline alone does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, new products, or changes in its market position.  Therefore, it's unlikely to significantly influence the stock price in either direction immediately.  Any price movement would be based on broader market trends, investor sentiment unrelated to this headline, or pre-existing expectations about Apple.  I'll assume the probability of a price rise or fall is approximately equal, with a small probability reflecting some inherent market noise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including downgrades by two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a disappointing AI outlook. iPhone sales in China have declined, and overall market share has dropped. The AI platform's rollout has been slow and not well-received, impacting investor expectations. Additionally, the company's revenue growth estimates have been revised downward. These factors suggest negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and increasing competition. These factors have led to a 4% tumble in Apple shares. Given the overall negative sentiment and specific concerns about weakening demand and poor sales forecasts, it is logical to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' due to expectations of a miss in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, citing weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. Additionally, demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 is expected to be cautious, and iPhone shipments were down 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December. These negative factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
