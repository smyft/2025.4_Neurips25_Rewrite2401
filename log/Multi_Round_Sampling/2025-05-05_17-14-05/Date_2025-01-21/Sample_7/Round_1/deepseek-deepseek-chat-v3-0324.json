(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may suggest uncertainty among investors and analysts regarding its future performance. However, without negative news, major shifts in market sentiment, or unfavorable earnings reports, the overall impression could be neutral. Given Apple's historical performance and strong brand loyalty, the potential for a rise remains plausible, while the uncertainty introduced by the question could also lead to a cautious outlook, resulting in some probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple (AAPL) stock. While the article doesn't explicitly state *why*, large sales by prominent figures can sometimes signal negative sentiment, potentially leading other investors to sell as well. However, the market reaction is also influenced by Apple's overall performance, market conditions, and other analyst reports. Pelosi's actions could be for portfolio diversification, personal financial needs, or other factors unrelated to Apple's future performance. Given that high-profile political figures usually get inside information, there's a slight lean towards predicting a fall. However, considering the limited standalone information and the size and stability of Apple as a company, it is not guaranteed.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline \"Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?\" is a question, not a statement of fact or a prediction.  It implies uncertainty about Apple's future performance, which is common in market analysis.  This headline alone does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, new products, or changes in its market position.  Therefore, it's unlikely to significantly influence the stock price in either direction immediately.  Any price movement would be based on broader market trends, investor sentiment unrelated to this headline, or pre-existing expectations about Apple.  I'll assume the probability of a price rise or fall is approximately equal, with a small probability reflecting some inherent market noise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including downgrades by two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a disappointing AI outlook. iPhone sales in China have declined, and overall market share has dropped. The AI platform's rollout has been slow and not well-received, impacting investor expectations. Additionally, the company's revenue growth estimates have been revised downward. These factors suggest negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and increasing competition. These factors have led to a 4% tumble in Apple shares. Given the overall negative sentiment and specific concerns about weakening demand and poor sales forecasts, it is logical to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' due to expectations of a miss in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, citing weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. Additionally, demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 is expected to be cautious, and iPhone shipments were down 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December. These negative factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
