(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may suggest uncertainty among investors and analysts regarding its future performance. However, without negative news, major shifts in market sentiment, or unfavorable earnings reports, the overall impression could be neutral. Given Apple's historical performance and strong brand loyalty, the potential for a rise remains plausible, while the uncertainty introduced by the question could also lead to a cautious outlook, resulting in some probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: This news indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold a significant amount of Apple (AAPL) stock. While the article doesn't explicitly state *why*, large sales by prominent figures can sometimes signal negative sentiment, potentially leading other investors to sell as well. However, the market reaction is also influenced by Apple's overall performance, market conditions, and other analyst reports. Pelosi's actions could be for portfolio diversification, personal financial needs, or other factors unrelated to Apple's future performance. Given that high-profile political figures usually get inside information, there's a slight lean towards predicting a fall. However, considering the limited standalone information and the size and stability of Apple as a company, it is not guaranteed.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline \"Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?\" is a question, not a statement of fact or a prediction.  It implies uncertainty about Apple's future performance, which is common in market analysis.  This headline alone does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance, new products, or changes in its market position.  Therefore, it's unlikely to significantly influence the stock price in either direction immediately.  Any price movement would be based on broader market trends, investor sentiment unrelated to this headline, or pre-existing expectations about Apple.  I'll assume the probability of a price rise or fall is approximately equal, with a small probability reflecting some inherent market noise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including downgrades by two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a disappointing AI outlook. iPhone sales in China have declined, and overall market share has dropped. The AI platform's rollout has been slow and not well-received, impacting investor expectations. Additionally, the company's revenue growth estimates have been revised downward. These factors suggest negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over sagging iPhone sales, lackluster performance in hardware and services, and increasing competition. These factors have led to a 4% tumble in Apple shares. Given the overall negative sentiment and specific concerns about weakening demand and poor sales forecasts, it is logical to infer that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' due to expectations of a miss in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, citing weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. Additionally, demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 is expected to be cautious, and iPhone shipments were down 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December. These negative factors contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a shift towards a bearish sentiment on Apple (AAPL) from various Wall Street firms due to decreasing growth prospects in the Chinese market and early-stage AI initiatives. The downgrade by prominent firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies, alongside comments from industry analysts suggesting challenges in continuing growth, all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Additionally, the mention of a potential wait-and-see approach and ongoing struggles in creating compelling AI offerings further underpin the market\u2019s concerns.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The question posed by the headline suggests uncertainty regarding Apple's position as a market leader, which could contribute to mixed sentiment among investors. Previous predictions highlighted concerns over weak sales and downgrades from analysts, indicating negative sentiment surrounding Apple's stock. However, without explicit negative news or a major catalyst, the overall impression remains cautious. Given Apple's historical brand strength and market presence, the prediction leans slightly towards a higher chance of rising, but the significant amount of negative sentiment keeps the probability of a fall notable.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's stock trades are often seen as signals by the market, whether justified or not. Her selling of Apple stock and Nvidia stock and buying of GOOGL and AMZN calls suggests a decreased confidence in Apple and NVIDIA compared to Google and Amazon. While her trades do not automatically guarantee price movements, the market perception of her investment acumen could amplify existing trends or create new ones. In this specific instance, previous rounds already indicated slightly negative sentiments of AAPL based on analysts downgrading the stock, and combined with Pelosi selling AAPL stock, there is a slightly increase likelyhood of the stock falling. Her Apple stock sale combined with existing slightly negative sentiment makes a price decrease a slightly higher probability than a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is ambiguous and doesn't provide concrete information about Apple's financial health.  However, the previous predictions reveal a significant divergence of opinion.  Early predictions leaned towards a slight probability of a price rise, reflecting Apple's general market strength. However, later predictions overwhelmingly favor a price fall, citing factors like analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales, disappointing AI performance, and decreased market share. The weight of this negative information significantly outweighs the initial neutral assessment and the ambiguity of the headline.  Therefore, I weigh the later, more specific, and negative predictions more heavily. While the headline itself is not inherently negative, the context provided by the subsequent predictions strongly suggests a bearish sentiment is currently dominating.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including two analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a disappointing AI outlook. iPhone sales in China have declined by 15-20% year over year, and overall iPhone market share has dropped. The AI platform's rollout has been slow and not well-received, impacting investor expectations. Additionally, revenue growth estimates have been revised downward. These factors collectively suggest a bearish sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price. While there are mentions of upcoming product launches (e.g., new iPhone SE, iPads, MacBook Airs) that could potentially boost sales, the immediate negative impact of the downgrades and weak sales forecasts outweighs these positives. Given the overwhelming negative sentiment in the news and the consensus from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple shares tumbled 4% after double downgrades by analysts, citing concerns over sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services. Multiple analysts have downgraded Apple's stock, with lowered price targets, due to weakening demand for iPhones, particularly in major foreign markets like China, and a lack of innovation in the product lineup. This widespread negative sentiment and specific concerns about Apple's revenue growth and market position suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Considering the consensus among analysts and the immediate 4% drop in stock price, it is logical to infer that the stock price is more likely to continue falling than rising in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock has slipped, causing Nvidia to reclaim its title as the world's most valuable public company. Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' due to expectations of a miss in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, citing weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. Additionally, demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 is expected to be cautious, and iPhone shipments were down 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December. These negative factors, combined with the overall trend of previous predictions, contribute to a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from various models also indicate a bearish sentiment, with most predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering this information, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., including downgrades by several analysts due to weak iPhone sales, increased competition in China, and early-stage AI initiatives. Key analysts such as Ben Bajarin point to a wait-and-see scenario regarding further growth. Several predictions from previous rounds show a strong indication of pessimism, supporting the view that the stock price is more likely to fall due to these negative factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The question posed in the news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' implies uncertainty about Apple's current standing in the market. Previous analyses indicate a significant amount of negative sentiment surrounding Apple due to analyst downgrades, concerns over weak iPhone sales, and disappointing performance in AI initiatives. These factors lead to a bearish outlook. Despite Apple\u2019s strong brand loyalty and market presence, the overall trend suggests that the pessimism from the analyst comments and the stock's recent performance overshadow any potential for optimistic movement. Therefore, there is a higher probability of stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares is a signal that could influence investor sentiment, possibly negatively. While her reasons for selling are unknown and could be unrelated to Apple's fundamentals, the market might interpret it as a lack of confidence. The article highlights that a Pelosi stock tracker has significantly outperformed hedge funds, implying that her trades are watched closely. Previous predictions have shown a negative sentiment towards Apple, with downgrades due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and AI outlook. Given this context and the trend in previous predictions and analysis, there's an increased probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline itself is vague and doesn't provide directional information. However, the subsequent predictions reveal a strong bearish sentiment.  Multiple models cite analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), disappointing AI performance, and overall decreased market share as reasons for a predicted price fall. While Apple's historical strength and brand loyalty could mitigate some negative impact, the weight of negative information from these multiple sources strongly suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling. The initial neutral-to-slightly-positive predictions are heavily outweighed by the later, more specific, and negative assessments.  The consensus among multiple models, coupled with the specific negative factors mentioned, leads to a prediction significantly weighted toward a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges for Apple Inc., including downgrades by two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a disappointing AI outlook. iPhone sales in China have declined, and overall market share has dropped. The AI platform's rollout has been slow and not well-received, impacting investor expectations. Additionally, the company's revenue growth estimates have been revised downward. These factors suggest negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock price. The consensus from previous predictions also indicates a bearish sentiment, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling.

Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' due to expectations of a miss in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, citing weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales. Additionally, demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4 is expected to be cautious, and iPhone shipments were down 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December.
