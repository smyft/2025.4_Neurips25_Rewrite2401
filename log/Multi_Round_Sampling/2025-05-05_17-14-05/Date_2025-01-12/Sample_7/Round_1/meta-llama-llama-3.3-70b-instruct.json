Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline indicates a cautionary perspective towards Apple Inc.'s stock, suggesting that while it is currently the largest company, investors should be wary. This type of analysis often highlights potential challenges ahead, which can lead to negative sentiment in the market. Therefore, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to investor caution and potential fear of underperformance in 2025. However, being a well-established company also provides some support for stock price stability or growth, albeit with lower probabilities given the context of the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view on Apple's stock. While highlighting its strong financial performance, market dominance, AI investments, dividend payouts, and share buybacks (all bullish indicators), it also emphasizes the high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, P/CF ratios are above their 5-year averages), and the lack of revolutionary new products lately (bearish indicators). The article explicitly mentions the stock being possibly overvalued and points to historical performance as a reason for caution, given that impressive year-to-year growth won't necessarily continue to hold. The author suggests cautious investment strategies. The 'Double Down' ad suggests a bullish sentiment, but this seems like a boiler plate marketing section. On balance, the slightly negative framing of the headline and emphasis on valuation make a slight downward movement more likely, while the mention of \"Apple Intelligence\" and consistent investment into AI could provide bullish moments. Overall, the article introduces uncertainty and doesn't clearly skew in either direction, the title could make a cautious investor consider selling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's current market position and future prospects.  While highlighting Apple's impressive revenue, profitability, and investments in AI, it also emphasizes concerns about its high valuation relative to historical averages.  Key valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, forward P/E, and P/CF ratios) all show Apple trading above its five-year average. This suggests the stock might be overvalued and prone to a correction.  The lack of recent revolutionary products also raises a question mark about future growth. However, Apple's strong financial position, consistent dividend growth, share buybacks, and potential AI-driven growth provide counter arguments.  The overall tone leans slightly towards caution, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall or at least sideways movement in the short to medium term. While long-term growth potential remains, the current high valuation poses significant risk.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's current position and future prospects. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial health, consistent dividend growth, share buybacks, and investments in AI (Apple Intelligence) suggest potential for continued growth. However, the stock's high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, Price-to-Cash Flow ratios) compared to historical averages indicate it may be overvalued, increasing the risk of a correction. Additionally, the lack of recent revolutionary product launches could limit future growth momentum. Given this mixed outlook, the stock's movement is likely to be influenced by investor sentiment around valuation and near-term AI-driven upgrades. The article does not suggest any immediate negative catalysts but warns of potential overvaluation risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This implies a cautious or negative outlook for Apple's stock performance in the near future. The headline does not provide specific details about why investors should be wary, but the tone suggests potential concerns about the company's growth prospects, market saturation, competition, or other factors that could impact its stock price. Given this cautious tone, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of the stock price rising is lower, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher compared to a neutral or positive news headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights both positive and negative aspects of investing in Apple Inc. The company's large market value, financial health, investments in artificial intelligence, and dividend payments are all positives. However, the article also notes that the stock's valuation metrics, such as price-to-sales ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio, are higher than their five-year averages, indicating potential overvaluation. Additionally, the lack of a revolutionary new product in recent years could impact future growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable in the short term due to valuation concerns.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
