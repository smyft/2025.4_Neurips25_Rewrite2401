The phrase \\\"investors should be wary\\\" indicates concerns about future performance. While the headline doesn't specify the reasons for caution, it implies underlying issues or challenges that could negatively impact the stock price. This warrants a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise. I am setting a fairly conservative probability given that the headline alone is not a highly detailed piece of information upon which to base a strong conclusion.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Largest Company in the World.
