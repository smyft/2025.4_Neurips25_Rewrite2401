While the situation might prompt existing users to consider upgrading their devices for more storage, this news does not present any significant financial impact or new product announcement that would drive substantial changes in stock price. In the short term, minor concerns like this are unlikely to affect the stock price significantly. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting general consumer demand for upgrading devices, but with a considerable chance of it falling as it is not a major catalyst.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Your iPhone Storage Is Full Again.
