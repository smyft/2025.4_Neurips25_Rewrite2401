Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses iPhone storage issues, which highlights a common pain point for users. While the situation might prompt existing users to consider upgrading their devices for more storage, this news does not present any significant financial impact or new product announcement that would drive substantial changes in stock price. In the short term, minor concerns like this are unlikely to affect the stock price significantly. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting general consumer demand for upgrading devices, but with a considerable chance of it falling as it is not a major catalyst.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses iPhone storage issues and potential solutions, mainly upgrading to a new phone with more storage. This indirectly suggests a continuous demand for new iPhones, potentially boosting sales and revenue in the long run. However, the article also implies user frustration with managing storage, which could lead some users to explore alternative brands with more generous default storage. Considering these counteracting forces, a minor positive impact is slightly more probable as it nudges consumers to upgrade to new devices. The effect is likely small and depends heavily on other events influencing the market's perception of Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline states that investors should be wary of Apple stock in 2025, despite Apple being the largest company globally.  This is a bearish sentiment. However, the article's content is missing, making it impossible to assess the specific reasons for this wariness. Without knowing the underlying concerns (e.g., saturation of the market, increased competition, slowing growth, anticipated economic downturn impacting consumer spending, supply chain disruptions, etc.),  it's difficult to accurately gauge the impact on the stock price.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on the generalized negative sentiment of the headline alone, assuming the article provides supporting arguments.  A lack of specifics necessitates a relatively neutral probability distribution, leaning slightly towards a potential fall due to the negative headline.  More information is needed for a more precise prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors regarding Apple's stock in 2025, implying potential risks or challenges ahead. While Apple's current status as the largest company in the world indicates strong performance, the warning could reflect concerns about market saturation, regulatory issues, or competitive pressures. This mixed sentiment may lead to uncertainty among investors, potentially increasing the likelihood of a stock price fall. However, Apple's strong brand and financials could mitigate some negative impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple Inc. being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This implies a cautious or negative outlook for the stock's future performance. The headline does not provide specific details about why investors should be wary, but the tone suggests potential concerns about the stock's future growth or stability. Based on this, it seems more likely that the stock price will fall rather than rise as investors might start to sell or be less optimistic about future gains.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.02, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which could potentially increase sales for Apple. However, the article does not contain any groundbreaking or unexpected information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The issue of iPhone storage is well-known, and the solution of upgrading to a new phone is not a new concept. Therefore, the article is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the largest company in the world with significant revenue and profitability. However, it also points out high valuations and concerns regarding the lack of revolutionary new products. The report suggests potential caution while acknowledging past strong performance and future investment. This mixed sentiment could lead to stable stock performance as investors weigh the risks and benefits.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a common user experience issue related to iPhone storage, which is likely to prompt some consumers to consider upgrading to newer models with more storage. While this indicates continued demand for iPhones and could positively affect sales, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be limited as the news lacks a significant financial catalyst or product announcement. The previously stated predictions show a range of cautious sentiment among analysts. I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise reflecting ongoing consumer demand for Apple products, but there is also a significant probability of stagnation or minor decline due to the absence of major news and mixed market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article describes a common user issue with iPhones - limited storage - and suggests upgrading to a new phone as one solution. This is a persistent issue and a well-established solution within Apple's ecosystem. While it might mildly incentivize upgrades, its impact on the stock is minimal. Previous rounds of predictions show mixed sentiment, with some seeing a slight positive nudge due to potential upgrades, while others see a slight negative sentiment due to user frustrations. Considering these factors and the previous analyses, the upward and downward pressures are mostly counterbalancing. I'm also slightly factoring in the other predictions, noticing a slight trend towards a 0.5 rise and a 0.5 fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline expresses caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current success.  This negative sentiment is amplified by the lack of specific details in the provided content.  Previous models show a range of predictions, with a noticeable shift towards a higher probability of a price fall over multiple rounds.  The initial predictions focused on the minor issue of iPhone storage, offering a relatively neutral outlook. However, the subsequent emphasis on the headline's warning ('investors should be wary') has swayed predictions towards a bearish stance.  The lack of detail in the news piece contributes to uncertainty. While Apple's market dominance is a significant positive, the absence of concrete information about future risks (e.g., competition, market saturation, economic downturn) leaves room for negative interpretation and investor apprehension. Considering the overall negative sentiment and the trending predictions, I assign a higher probability to a stock price fall. The trend in predictions demonstrates a gradual increase in the belief that negative factors might outweigh positive ones.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors regarding Apple's stock in 2025, indicating potential risks or challenges ahead. While Apple's current status as the largest company in the world suggests strong performance, the warning could reflect concerns about market saturation, regulatory issues, or competitive pressures. Previous predictions show a general trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models significantly lowering the rise probability due to lack of groundbreaking information or the negative sentiment of the headline. The mixed sentiment and cautious outlook from the headline and previous analyses suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling, but with some uncertainty given Apple's strong fundamentals. Therefore, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a more bearish outlook based on the collective analysis.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple Inc. being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This implies a cautious or negative outlook for the stock's future performance. The mixed sentiment may lead to uncertainty among investors, potentially increasing the likelihood of a stock price fall. However, Apple's strong brand and financials could mitigate some negative impact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general leaning towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, especially given the bearish sentiment expressed in some of the headlines.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution. This could potentially increase sales for Apple, but the article does not contain any groundbreaking or unexpected information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed sentiment regarding the stock price movement. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential increase in sales, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about market saturation, regulatory issues, or competitive pressures. However, since the issue of iPhone storage is well-known and the solution of upgrading to a new phone is not a new concept, the article is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting the potential increase in sales, but with a considerable chance of it falling as it is not a major catalyst.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the largest company in the world with significant revenue and profitability. However, it also expresses caution and outlines several reasons why investors should be wary of the stock in 2025, including high valuations, lack of revolutionary new products, and past market performances suggesting slower gains. The overall mixed sentiment from both positive and negative indicators results in a relatively neutral outlook. Given the cautious tone and specific valuation concerns, the probability of a stock price fall is weighted slightly more.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about iPhone storage highlights a common consumer issue, encouraging users to consider upgrading their devices for more storage. This could indicate ongoing demand for new iPhones and potentially boost sales. However, the impact on stock price is likely to be limited as there are no significant new developments or financial catalysts reported. Analyzing past predictions, there's a mixed sentiment among models, with some indicating a slight upward bias due to potential upgrades, while others highlight caution and concerns over market saturation and other risks. Therefore, factoring in both positive impacts from potential upgrades and the prevailing cautious sentiment, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise with a fair chance of decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on iPhone storage issues and suggests upgrading for more space. This is a recurring problem with a known solution, making its impact on stock price minimal. While it could nudge some users to upgrade, boosting sales slightly, it's not a significant catalyst. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, but I'm leaning towards a slightly more positive outlook as several models assigned slightly higher probabilities for stocks rising, which likely means they received positive signals from other sources. This could indicate the market's anticipating other positive catalysts during around same period. However, with limited information, these could also be false positives. I'll stay neutral, but adjust the probability accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline warns investors to be wary of Apple stock in 2025 despite its current market leadership.  This negative sentiment, lacking specific supporting details, is the primary driver of the analysis.  The previous rounds of predictions show a trend toward a higher probability of a price fall, starting with a near-even split and progressively shifting toward a more bearish outlook.  While some models initially highlighted the potential for increased sales due to iPhone storage issues prompting upgrades, this positive factor is overshadowed by the overarching cautionary tone of the headline.  The lack of concrete information about the reasons for the warning makes it difficult to quantify the positive impacts. Considering the evolving consensus among previous models and the absence of specific positive news, I favor a higher probability of a stock price decline.  However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand recognition mitigate complete certainty. Therefore, I don't assign extremely low probabilities for a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors regarding Apple's stock in 2025, despite its current status as the largest company in the world.
