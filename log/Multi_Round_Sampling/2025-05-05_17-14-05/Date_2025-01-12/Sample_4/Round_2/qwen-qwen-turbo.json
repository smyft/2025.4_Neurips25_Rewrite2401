Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late.

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view on Apple Inc.'s stock. While it highlights Apple's success and potential with investments in AI and steady dividend growth, it also cautions about high valuation metrics compared to historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary products. The strong past performance may not guarantee future gains, making investors wary. Given this mixed sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is estimated to be moderate, while the potential for a fall due to overvaluation and market corrections is significant.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view on Apple's stock. While highlighting its strong financial performance, market dominance, AI investments, dividends, and share buybacks (positive indicators), it also emphasizes its high valuation metrics (PSR, P/E, etc.) compared to historical averages and lack of revolutionary new products recently (negative indicators). This suggests a potential overvaluation and limited near-term growth catalysts. The recommendation to buy in increments reveals uncertainty. The 'Double Down' promotion, though mentioning Apple's past success, seems like generic marketing copy. The article's neutral tone and specific valuation concerns lead to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline states that investors should be wary of Apple stock in 2025, despite Apple being the largest company globally.  This is a bearish sentiment. However, the article's content is missing, making it impossible to assess the specific reasons for this warning.  Without the supporting arguments within the article, we can assume a neutral stance, slightly leaning towards a lower probability of price increase due to the negative headline sentiment, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty without the full context of the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue among iPhone users\u2014storage limitations\u2014and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage, which could increase Apple's revenue. However, the article does not introduce any new products, services, or significant financial implications that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The topic is more of a general consumer tip rather than a financial or business development. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage capacity, suggesting that users could upgrade to a new phone with more storage. However, this article does not contain any significant financial information that would directly impact Apple's stock price. It is more of a consumer advice piece than a financial news article. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a substantial effect on the stock price of Apple Inc. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low, but if I had to estimate, I would slightly lean towards a neutral or slightly positive impact as it indirectly promotes the company's products.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the issue of iPhone storage space and the potential for users to upgrade to a new phone with more storage, which could lead to increased sales for Apple. However, the article does not provide any significant or surprising information about the company's financial performance, product releases, or market trends that would directly impact the stock price. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to the potential for increased sales, but overall, the news is neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the world's largest company with significant metrics such as a market value of $3.68 trillion. Despite its strong performance and healthy financial health, it raises concerns regarding its high valuation metrics, which suggest potential overvaluation. The lack of new revolutionary products and recent high gains may pose risks for future growth expectations. These factors collectively indicate that while Apple remains a profitable investment, there are cautious points for concern.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a well-rounded view of Apple's current position, highlighting its strong financial metrics and market dominance while also raising valid concerns regarding its high valuation ratios and the absence of recent revolutionary products. While many investors might be attracted to Apple's historical performance and stability, the cautionary tone of the article suggests potential risks that could lead to price corrections. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of falling stock prices, reflecting concerns over overvaluation and market dynamics despite its robust financial foundation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's stock in 2025. It acknowledges Apple's strengths, such as its massive revenue, profitability, investments in AI, dividend growth, and share buybacks. However, it also raises concerns about its high valuation metrics (PSR, P/E, price-to-cash flow ratios) relative to historical averages and the absence of recent groundbreaking product innovations. These valuation concerns and the potential for a market correction suggest a higher risk of a price decline. Round 0 Predictions are mixed. some indicating a price rising(0.55), some indicating a price falling(0.6). Considering the article's cautionary message about valuation and moderate growth expectations, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline expresses caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current market dominance.  However, the article content is missing, leaving the reasons for this caution unspecified.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (around 0.5), and others towards a higher probability of a price fall (around 0.6).  Several models highlight Apple's high valuation as a potential risk factor.  The lack of details in the news itself prevents a definitive prediction. Considering the diverse opinions and the absence of concrete supporting information in the news piece, a neutral stance with a slight bias towards the possibility of a fall is adopted, reflective of the prevailing cautious sentiment in the market concerning Apple\u2019s valuation.  The previous predictions, while varying, consistently reflect this uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue among iPhone users\u2014storage limitations\u2014and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage, which could potentially increase Apple's revenue.

It is more of a general consumer advice piece rather than a financial or business development. Additionally, previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment, with some models highlighting potential overvaluation and lack of growth catalysts. Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage capacity and suggests that users could upgrade to a new phone with more storage. This could potentially lead to increased sales for Apple, as it indirectly promotes the company's products. However, the article does not contain any significant financial information that would directly impact Apple's stock price. It is more of a consumer advice piece than a financial news article. Therefore, the impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. is likely to be minimal. Given the neutral nature of the article and the potential for increased sales through upgrades, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhone storage capacity and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage, which could increase Apple's revenue. However, the article does not introduce any new products, services, or significant financial implications that would directly impact Apple's stock price.
