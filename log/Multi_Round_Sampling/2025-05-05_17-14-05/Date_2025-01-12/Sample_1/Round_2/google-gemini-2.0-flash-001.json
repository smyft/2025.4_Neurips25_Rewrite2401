Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline discusses iPhone storage issues, which highlights a common pain point for users. While the situation might prompt existing users to consider upgrading their iPhones for more storage, indicating a potential increase in sales and subsequently a positive sentiment towards Apple's products, the direct impact of this news on stock prices is likely limited. Generally, storage issues are a recurring aspect of technology use, and while it may invoke short-term consumer action, it doesn't signal a significant change in Apple's business fundamentals. Thus, I estimate a modest probability of stock price rise due to potential upgrades but also recognize that such news typically does not lead to significant price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view on Apple's stock. While highlighting its strong financial performance, market dominance, AI investments, dividends, and share buybacks (positive indicators), it also emphasizes its high valuation metrics (PSR, P/E, etc.) compared to historical averages and lack of revolutionary new products recently (negative indicators). This suggests a potential overvaluation and limited near-term growth catalysts. The recommendation to buy in increments reveals uncertainty. The 'Double Down' promotion, though mentioning Apple's past success, seems like generic marketing copy. The article's neutral tone and specific valuation concerns lead to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline states that investors should be wary of Apple stock in 2025, despite Apple being the largest company globally.  This is a bearish sentiment. However, the article's content is missing, making it impossible to assess the specific reasons for this wariness. Without knowing the underlying concerns (e.g., saturation of the market, increased competition, slowing growth, upcoming regulations, etc.), we can only make a general assessment.  The fact that the article focuses on caution suggests a higher likelihood of a price fall than a rise, but the absence of concrete reasons weakens this prediction significantly.  The prediction leans towards a fall primarily due to the negative sentiment expressed in the headline, but it's crucial to remember that this is a highly uncertain estimation without the article's content.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses iPhone storage limitations and suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage, which could drive additional sales for Apple. This is a common issue for iPhone users and highlights a potential upsell opportunity for Apple, as customers may opt for higher storage models or newer devices. However, the news does not indicate any groundbreaking innovation or immediate financial impact, so the effect on the stock price is likely to be neutral or mildly positive. The probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact is not significant.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses both positive and negative factors influencing Apple's stock price. On the positive side, Apple is investing heavily in AI, has a strong financial position, pays a growing dividend, and has a history of share buybacks. However, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's valuation, noting that its price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-cash flow ratios are above their five-year averages. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its growth potential. Given these mixed signals, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising as 0.55 and the probability of it falling as 0.45. The slight inclination towards a rise is based on Apple's strong financials and growth initiatives, but the high valuation and lack of recent revolutionary products temper the upside potential.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as the largest company in the world, with a market value of $3.68 trillion. Despite its impressive financial performance, the article highlights reasons for caution, including its high valuation metrics, such as price-to-sales ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio, which are above their five-year averages. Additionally, the article notes that Apple has not introduced a revolutionary new product in a while, which could impact its future growth. However, the company's investments in artificial intelligence, dividend payments, and share repurchases are positives. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but still significant due to the company's strong financials and potential for future growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about iPhone storage issues highlights a common consumer pain point, which could lead to increased sales of higher storage models or newer devices, suggesting a potential positive impact on revenues for Apple. However, the overall impact on stock prices may be limited, as this scenario is a recurring issue and does not indicate any significant change in the company's fundamentals. The previous predictions reveal a mix of sentiments, leaning towards caution due to high valuations and lack of recent groundbreaking innovations. Therefore, while there is potential for a modest stock price rise due to upgrade sales, the uncertain broader market sentiment leads to a more balanced assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple's stock performance, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. The positive factors include Apple's strong financials, investments in AI, consistent dividend growth, and share buybacks. However, the article also emphasizes high valuation metrics compared to historical averages and a lack of recent revolutionary products. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the specific valuation concerns and the overall neutral to slightly bearish tone of the article, along with the balanced arguments and recent market trends (and mixed prior predictions),I adjust the probabilities slightly towards a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline warns investors to be wary of Apple stock in 2025 despite its current market leadership.  This negative sentiment is a significant factor. However, the absence of detailed supporting information in the provided news content makes a precise prediction challenging.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance. Some models highlight positive aspects like AI investments, dividends, and share buybacks. Others emphasize concerns about overvaluation and a lack of revolutionary new products.  Considering the bearish headline and the lack of concrete supporting details, along with the spread in previous model predictions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledging significant uncertainty.  The lack of specific negative news in the article leads to a probability closer to 0.5 than a strongly bearish prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a common issue faced by iPhone users regarding storage limitations, which could prompt some users to upgrade to higher storage models or newer devices. This could lead to a slight increase in sales for Apple. However, the news does not indicate any significant change in Apple's business fundamentals or introduce any groundbreaking innovation. Previous predictions from other models show mixed sentiment, with some leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative. Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed previous predictions, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling, but both probabilities remain close to neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view of Apple's stock, highlighting both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, Apple's strong financial performance, investments in AI, dividend payments, and share repurchases are noted. However, the article also emphasizes concerns about Apple's high valuation metrics and the lack of revolutionary new products. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. The company's strong financials and potential for future growth contribute to a significant probability of a price rise, but the high valuation and lack of recent innovation temper this upside potential.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a common issue with iPhone storage and implies that users may consider upgrading to a new model with more storage, which could potentially lead to increased sales. Several predictions provided earlier show a mixed outlook with a slight bias towards a stock price rise. The news does not introduce any alarming or revolutionary changes, so the impact is likely moderate but slightly positive. The probabilities are influenced by the neutral to cautiously positive tone of the news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
