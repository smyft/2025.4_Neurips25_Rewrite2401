While the situation might prompt existing users to consider upgrading their iPhones for more storage, indicating a potential increase in sales and subsequently a positive sentiment towards Apple's products, the direct impact of this news on stock prices is likely limited. Generally, storage issues are a recurring aspect of technology use, and while it may invoke short-term consumer action, it doesn't signal a significant change in Apple's business fundamentals. Thus, I estimate a modest probability of stock price rise due to potential upgrades but also recognize that such news typically does not lead to significant price movement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Your iPhone Storage Is Full Again.
