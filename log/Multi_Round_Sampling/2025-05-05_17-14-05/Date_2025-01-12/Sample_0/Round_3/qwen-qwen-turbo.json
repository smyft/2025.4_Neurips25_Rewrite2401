Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025.\nNews Content: Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary of the Stock in 2025. was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses iPhone storage issues, which highlights a common pain point for users. While the situation might prompt existing users to consider upgrading their devices for more storage, this news is largely focused on user experience rather than a significant business development or product announcement. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a strong impact on stock price, but there might be a modest positive sentiment for potential upgrades. Given these considerations, I estimate a slightly higher probability for stock price rise due to potential upgrade purchases, but still keep a reasonable possibility for it to fall due to lack of substantial positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a balanced view on Apple's stock. While highlighting its strong financial performance, market dominance, AI investments, dividends, and share buybacks (positive indicators), it also emphasizes its high valuation metrics (PSR, P/E, etc.) compared to historical averages and lack of revolutionary new products recently (negative indicators). This suggests a potential overvaluation and limited near-term growth catalysts. The recommendation to buy in increments reveals uncertainty. The 'Double Down' promotion, though mentioning Apple's past success, seems like generic marketing copy. The article's neutral tone and specific valuation concerns lead to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline states that investors should be wary of Apple stock in 2025, despite Apple being the largest company globally.  This is a bearish sentiment. However, the article's content is missing, making a precise probability assessment impossible.  Without knowing the specific reasons for wariness (e.g., concerns about competition, slowing growth, economic downturn, etc.), we can only make a general assumption. The headline itself creates negative sentiment, but the lack of supporting details prevents a more nuanced prediction.  Therefore, we'll assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty due to missing information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors regarding Apple's stock in 2025, implying potential risks or challenges ahead. While Apple is currently the largest company in the world, the warning could be based on factors like market saturation, regulatory scrutiny, or slowing innovation. Such sentiment might lead to negative investor perception, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate some of the downside. Given the tone of the headline, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This implies a cautious or negative outlook for Apple's stock performance in the near future. The headline does not provide specific details about why investors should be wary, but the tone suggests potential concerns or challenges ahead. Based on this, it seems more likely that the stock price might experience a negative impact rather than a positive one. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses a common issue with iPhones, known as iPhone Storage Creep, where users run out of storage space on their devices. The article suggests upgrading to a new phone with more storage as a solution, which could potentially increase sales for Apple. However, the article does not provide any significant or material information about the company's financial performance, future prospects, or major developments that would typically impact stock prices. As a result, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. The probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to the potential for increased sales, but overall, the news is relatively neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the world's largest company with strong financial metrics and a track record of impressive performance. However, the valuation multiples suggest the stock is currently priced high relative to its earnings and cash flows, which could indicate a higher risk of price correction. While the company's financial health and consistent growth are supportive factors, the lack of revolutionary new products and potential overvaluation pose risks. The analyst's caution and mention of other undervalued opportunities further suggest a mixed outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding iPhone storage issues suggests that existing users may consider upgrading their devices, which could lead to an increase in sales for Apple. However, the article primarily focuses on a user experience issue rather than providing significant financial information or developments that could strongly impact the stock. Previous predictions showed a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a cautious outlook due to potential overvaluation and a lack of new product innovations. Given the modest positive sentiment generated from potential upgrades, I estimate a slightly higher probability for the stock price to rise. However, I also acknowledge the concerns from previous predictions regarding overvaluation and lack of major catalysts, leading to a reasonable probability of the stock falling as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook on Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's strong financial performance and market position, its high valuation is a significant concern. The lack of revolutionary new products is also a negative factor. The article suggests caution, which aligns with several previous predictions leaning towards a price decrease. However, Apple's AI investments and shareholder returns provide some upside potential. Given the concerns about valuation and the previous rounds' predictions trending slightly negative, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, but acknowledge the inherent strength of Apple as a company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline warns investors to be wary of Apple stock in 2025 despite its current market leadership.  This negative sentiment is the dominant factor. While the lack of article content prevents a definitive analysis, the repeated bearish predictions from previous models (especially those with access to more information, implicitly indicated by their differing predictions) reinforce the cautious outlook.  Although Apple's fundamentals are strong, the headline's warning suggests potential headwinds, such as increased competition, slowing growth, or economic factors not explicitly mentioned, making a price drop more probable than a rise in the near term. The slight variation among previous models likely reflects differing interpretations of unseen information or varying time horizons.  The overall consensus leans bearish, but not overwhelmingly so, indicating some probability of resilience due to Apple's inherent strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025. This implies a cautious or negative outlook for Apple's stock performance in the near future. The headline does not provide specific details about why investors should be wary, but the tone suggests potential concerns or challenges ahead. Given this, and considering the previous round of predictions where most models leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty could mitigate some of the downside, so the probability isn't overwhelmingly negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that despite Apple being the largest company in the world, investors should be wary of the stock in 2025.

Given the relatively neutral tone of the news and the mixed predictions from other models, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as the world's largest company with strong financial metrics and a track record of impressive performance, which generally supports a bullish outlook. However, it also points out potential risks such as its high valuation metrics, lack of revolutionary new products, and the need for a cautious approach. The article balances various aspects: strong financial health, dividend payouts, and share buybacks versus high valuations. Given the cautious recommendation and concern over valuation, there is a considerable degree of skepticism surrounding the stock, leading to a slightly higher likelihood of a price correction.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.54, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.46, Reasoning: The news highlights a common issue faced by iPhone users regarding storage limitations, which may lead to increased sales as users consider upgrading to newer models with larger storage capacities. Despite this potential for increased sales, the news does not provide significant financial insights or developments that would strongly impact stock price. Previous predictions show a cautious sentiment overall due to concerns about Apple's valuation and lack of recent revolutionary products. Given the mixed outlook with a slightly higher inclination towards potential upgrades, I estimate a marginally higher probability of rising stock prices.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple. While strong revenue, AI investment, dividends, and buybacks are positives, high valuation and lack of recent revolutionary products are concerns. Prior rounds show a slight leaning towards a price decrease, emphasizing valuation worries. I'm sticking with a slightly higher chance of a price fall, influenced by the article's cautionary tone and the trend in previous predictions. However, Apple's fundamental strength and potential AI upside prevent a heavily bearish assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline expresses caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025 despite its current market dominance.  The lack of article content makes a definitive prediction difficult, but the consistent bearish sentiment across multiple models in previous rounds, and the headline itself, significantly influences my assessment.  Although Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty offer a degree of resilience, the perceived risks (potentially including overvaluation, lack of groundbreaking innovations, increased competition, or macroeconomic factors) outweigh the potential for short-term growth driven by minor factors like iPhone storage upgrades. The consensus from previous models leaning towards a price fall, even with varying levels of certainty, strengthens the likelihood of a downward trend.  The probability isn't overwhelmingly negative, acknowledging the possibility of the stock holding value or experiencing minor positive fluctuations, but the overall risk profile suggests a higher chance of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests caution for investors regarding Apple's stock in 2025, despite its current market leadership.
