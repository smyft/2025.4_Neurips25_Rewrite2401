(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant dispute with Indonesia, which is critical for the sales of the iPhone 16 in that market. The report highlights both Apple's commitment to invest $1 billion and the Indonesian government's expectation of a resolution soon, which is a positive signal for investors. Additionally, resolving this issue would likely lead to increased sales and revenue for Apple in Southeast Asia. Given these factors, there is a strong likelihood that the stock price will rise as investor sentiment improves. However, there remains a small risk that negotiations could still face hurdles, hence a lower but not negligible probability for a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company. This suggests negative sentiment toward Apple, potentially leading to further price decline. While Apple is mentioned in other news, such as companies 'in the news' on Wednesday, the overall tone is not favorable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone before Apple, potentially capturing a segment of the market Apple was aiming for. While this could be seen as a negative for Apple, the impact is likely to be limited.  Apple's overall market share and brand loyalty remain strong. The article emphasizes that Apple's own ultrathin iPhone is still expected later in the year, minimizing the competitive threat. Samsung's lower price point for its phone may attract some budget-conscious consumers, but  is unlikely to significantly dent Apple's premium market share.  The news is therefore more of a neutral event than a strongly negative one for Apple. The probability of stock price movement will largely depend on other market factors and investor sentiment at that time, rather than solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings and options strategies, but the content primarily focuses on small caps and hedging strategies using the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). There is no direct information about Apple's financial performance or specific guidance that would significantly impact its stock price. Therefore, the news does not provide a clear bullish or bearish signal for Apple. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami is generally positive. The store offers the full lineup of Apple products, features an industry-leading environmental store design, and provides personalized support to customers. While the impact of a single store opening on the overall stock price might be limited, the news highlights Apple's continued investment in retail and its commitment to environmental sustainability and community engagement. There is no negative information in the news that would suggest a decline in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline announces the release of Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a focus on AI features, which could potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales and stock price. The article mentions that Apple's stock was hit with two downgrades due to fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales, implying that the new Samsung release could further exacerbate this trend. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in the potential impact of Samsung's new release, and Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected. Given the competitive nature of the smartphone market and the potential for Samsung's new AI features to attract customers, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued bull run for the Nasdaq 100, driven by favorable factors such as reduced bond yields and the potential for positive earnings reports. The analyst notes that technology stocks, including Apple, remain in an outstanding position to contribute to this market upward trend. However, it's noted that there are upcoming pivotal events, including Fed policy decisions and earnings announcements, which could affect short-term volatility.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While this could be perceived negatively,  several factors mitigate the impact.  Firstly, Apple's own ultrathin iPhone is still anticipated, minimizing the long-term competitive disadvantage. The news emphasizes that this will be one of Apple's boldest design changes in years which suggests customers may be highly anticipating this product. Secondly, Samsung's lower price point targets a different consumer segment, leaving Apple's premium market relatively untouched.  Finally, previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some believing the news is neutral or even positive for Apple. Considering the overall market sentiment and the limited impact of Samsung's move on Apple's high-end market share, the probability of a price drop is low. The probability of a rise is slightly higher since the new thin iPhone may generate excitement and positive investor reactions. However, this is not a market-moving event; other factors will significantly influence Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
