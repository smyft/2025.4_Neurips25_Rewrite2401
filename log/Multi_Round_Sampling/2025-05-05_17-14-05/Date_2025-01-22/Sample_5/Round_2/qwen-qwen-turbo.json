(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nasdaq 100\u2019s Historic Bull Run Has Further to Go, Evercore Says\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is close to resolving a significant dispute with Indonesia, which is critical for the sales of the iPhone 16 in that market. The report highlights both Apple's commitment to invest $1 billion and the Indonesian government's expectation of a resolution soon, which is a positive signal for investors. Additionally, resolving this issue would likely lead to increased sales and revenue for Apple in Southeast Asia. Given these factors, there is a strong likelihood that the stock price will rise as investor sentiment improves. However, there remains a small risk that negotiations could still face hurdles, hence a lower but not negligible probability for a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock fell 3% in the previous session and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company. This suggests negative sentiment toward Apple, potentially leading to further price decline. While Apple is mentioned in other news, such as companies 'in the news' on Wednesday, the overall tone is not favorable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone before Apple, potentially capturing a segment of the market Apple was aiming for. While this could be seen as a negative for Apple, the impact is likely to be limited.  Apple's overall market share and brand loyalty remain strong. The article emphasizes that Apple's own ultrathin iPhone is still expected later in the year, minimizing the competitive threat. Samsung's lower price point for its phone may attract some budget-conscious consumers, but  is unlikely to significantly dent Apple's premium market share.  The news is therefore more of a neutral event than a strongly negative one for Apple. The probability of stock price movement will largely depend on other market factors and investor sentiment at that time, rather than solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings and options strategies, but the content primarily focuses on small caps and hedging strategies using the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). There is no direct information about Apple's financial performance or specific guidance that would significantly impact its stock price. Therefore, the news does not provide a clear bullish or bearish signal for Apple. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of impactful information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami is generally positive. The store offers the full lineup of Apple products, features an industry-leading environmental store design, and provides personalized support to customers. While the impact of a single store opening on the overall stock price might be limited, the news highlights Apple's continued investment in retail and its commitment to environmental sustainability and community engagement. There is no negative information in the news that would suggest a decline in stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline announces the release of Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a focus on AI features, which could potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales and stock price. The article mentions that Apple's stock was hit with two downgrades due to fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales, implying that the new Samsung release could further exacerbate this trend. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in the potential impact of Samsung's new release, and Apple's stock price may not be significantly affected. Given the competitive nature of the smartphone market and the potential for Samsung's new AI features to attract customers, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued bull run for the Nasdaq 100, driven by favorable factors such as reduced bond yields and the potential for positive earnings reports. The analyst notes that technology stocks, including Apple, remain in an outstanding position to contribute to this market upward trend. However, it's noted that there are upcoming pivotal events, including Fed policy decisions and earnings announcements, which could affect short-term volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a crucial development for Apple regarding the resolution of its dispute with Indonesia, which directly impacts the sales of the iPhone 16. The company's significant commitment of $1 billion for local investment suggests Apple's strong intent to meet regulatory requirements and regain market access. Given the favorable statements from Indonesian officials about resolving the issue within one to two weeks, investor sentiment is likely to improve. While there is some lingering uncertainty, the overall tone is positive, leading to a higher probability that the stock price will rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights that Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable company, with AAPL shares falling 3% in the previous session. This is a significant piece of negative news for Apple, indicating a shift in market sentiment and investor confidence. While Apple is mentioned among other news items, the primary focus is on its decline relative to Nvidia. The trend of previous predictions shows a varying sentiment, but mostly trending downward given negative signals. Considering Nvidia's ascendance and Apple's recent stock performance, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Samsung's preemptive launch of an ultrathin phone, putting them ahead of Apple in this specific market segment. While this could be perceived negatively,  several factors mitigate the impact.  Firstly, Apple's own ultrathin iPhone is still anticipated, minimizing the long-term competitive disadvantage. The news emphasizes that this will be one of Apple's boldest design changes in years which suggests customers may be highly anticipating this product. Secondly, Samsung's lower price point targets a different consumer segment, leaving Apple's premium market relatively untouched.  Finally, previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some believing the news is neutral or even positive for Apple. Considering the overall market sentiment and the limited impact of Samsung's move on Apple's high-end market share, the probability of a price drop is low. The probability of a rise is slightly higher since the new thin iPhone may generate excitement and positive investor reactions. However, this is not a market-moving event; other factors will significantly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content primarily discuss small caps and hedging strategies using the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), with only a passing mention of Apple's earnings. There is no specific information about Apple's financial performance or guidance that would significantly impact its stock price. Given the lack of direct, impactful information about Apple, the probabilities are estimated to be neutral. Previous predictions from other models also show mixed sentiments, with some leaning slightly bullish or bearish, but none strongly so due to the lack of concrete Apple-related news. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Samsung's new Galaxy S25 line with a focus on AI features could potentially impact Apple's iPhone sales and stock price. However, considering Apple's strong brand loyalty and market share, the impact of Samsung's new release might be limited. The fact that Apple's stock was hit with two downgrades due to fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales suggests that the market has already factored in some potential negative impact. Given the competitive nature of the smartphone market and the potential for Samsung's new AI features to attract customers, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. However, the difference in probabilities is not significant, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for various market factors to influence the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued bull run for the Nasdaq 100, driven by favorable factors such as reduced bond yields and the potential for positive earnings reports. The analyst notes that technology stocks, including Apple, remain in an outstanding position to contribute to this market upward trend. However, it's noted that there are upcoming pivotal events, including Fed policy decisions and earnings announcements, which could affect short-term volatility.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
