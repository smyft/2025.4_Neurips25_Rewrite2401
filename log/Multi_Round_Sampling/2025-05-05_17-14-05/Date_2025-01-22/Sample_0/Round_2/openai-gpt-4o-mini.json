(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet\nNews Content: Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and its implications for the semiconductor industry. Apple's stock price is indirectly affected by Intel's uncertainties, given their connection in the tech supply chain. With Intel's stock facing turbulence due to leadership challenges, it may create a cautious outlook in the semiconductor sector, including Apple. However, Apple has shown resilience and strong fundamentals, which may counteract negative sentiments related to Intel. Thus, while there is concern about Intel's future impacting the broader market, Apple's intrinsic strengths suggest a lower probability of stock decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings, implying an upcoming earnings announcement. Earnings announcements are typically volatile periods for stock prices, with the movement depending on whether the reported earnings and forward guidance beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. The news doesn't provide specific information about those expectations or any indication about whether Apple is likely to outperform or underperform. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned close to 50% with a slight preference to the rise, as Apple is historically a company that often beats expectations. The segment focusing on small caps and hedging strategies doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, although overall market sentiment can influence it. Given the rally in small caps, there may be some broader economic stability implied that could positively impact Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the company's earnings projections are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue,  the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is concerning.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests neither significant buying nor selling pressure.  The high forward P/E and PEG ratios indicate the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry. The positive industry ranking provides some support. Overall, the positive earnings outlook is countered by valuation concerns and recent underperformance.  Given the mixed signals, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the positive earnings forecast, but the risk is not negligible given the current valuation and market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement with Indonesia to lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales, which was imposed due to non-compliance with local content requirements. The resolution of this issue would allow Apple to re-enter one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting sales and revenue. This positive development is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, leading to increased confidence in the stock. However, the stock price movement may also depend on broader market conditions and other company-specific factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive sentiment and potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly indicate a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The news primarily discusses small caps and a strategy for hedging against downside risk using options on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). It mentions Apple's earnings but does not provide any specific information that would lead to a significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, given that the question is about whether to buy the stock before the event, it implies that there might be some positive expectation or speculation around the event, which could lead to a rise in stock price. Nonetheless, the absence of concrete details means the impact could go either way, so the probabilities assigned reflect a moderate inclination towards a positive outcome due to the speculative nature of the headline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive advantage in the smartphone market. This could lead to increased market share for Samsung, which may negatively impact Apple's sales. However, Apple is planning to introduce its own ultrathin model later in the year, which might mitigate some of the negative effects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's leadership challenges, which do not have a direct negative impact on Apple's stock. However, as Intel is a significant player in the semiconductor supply chain, uncertainties surrounding its CEO search could create cautious sentiment in the tech sector. That said, Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience provide a buffer against potential negative sentiments. Additionally, the broader market context remains moderately optimistic, potentially leaning towards a slight upward movement for Apple. Given the significant uncertainty regarding Intel's future leadership and strategy, I estimate a modest probability of a stock price rise, while considering the cautious outlook from the market could lead to a probability of decline as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on how to play small caps using options strategies, with a brief mention of how investors might want to play Apple's earnings. The small cap discussion is not directly relevant to Apple, but the earnings mention is. Without specific details about analyst expectations or hints about whether Apple might beat or miss, it's difficult to gauge the likely direction. The previous models generally hovered around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall, reflecting uncertainty. Given that earnings are mentioned, suggesting an imminent announcement, and in line with recent consensus, I'll slightly favor a rise due to Apple's historical tendency to meet or exceed expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings show growth, the stock's recent underperformance relative to the market and sector is a concern.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is neutral.  High P/E and PEG ratios suggest overvaluation. However, the positive industry ranking offers some support. Positive earnings forecasts are offset by valuation concerns and recent underperformance. The consensus EPS projection remained stagnant over the past 30 days, indicating a lack of significant positive momentum from analyst revisions. Previous model predictions are quite varied, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, highlighting uncertainty. Considering all factors, the slight upward trend in earnings projections and the generally positive industry outlook slightly favor a rise, but the valuation concerns and recent underperformance temper this optimism.  The near-term uncertainty around earnings announcement adds to the overall volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement with Indonesia to lift a sales ban on the iPhone 16 series, which was imposed due to non-compliance with local content requirements. This resolution would allow Apple to re-enter one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting sales and revenue. The positive sentiment from this development is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, leading to increased confidence in the stock. However, the stock price movement may also depend on broader market conditions and other company-specific factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss small caps and hedging strategies but also mention Apple's earnings. There is no direct information about Apple's future performance or any specific factors that would cause the stock price to rise or fall significantly. However, the mention of Apple's earnings could imply potential volatility around the earnings announcement. Given that earnings announcements often lead to positive surprises for Apple, there's a slight bias towards a positive movement. The overall market sentiment and the discussion around small caps do not provide direct negative indicators for Apple. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned with a slight preference towards a rise, reflecting Apple's historical performance and the potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, some of which were based on different news content, it's essential to focus on the current headline. The speculative nature of the headline implies that there might be some positive expectation or speculation around the event, which could lead to a rise in stock price. However, without concrete details, the impact could go either way. Given the historical resilience and strong fundamentals of Apple, and considering the balance of previous predictions, a moderate inclination towards a positive outcome seems reasonable. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of falling, reflecting the uncertainty and the potential for positive news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive advantage. This could impact Apple's market share negatively, leading to potential investor concerns about Apple's performance in the ultrathin smartphone category. However, it's noted that Apple is planning its own ultrathin model for later in the year, which could help mitigate some of the negative effects. Previous predictions show varied sentiments, with some predicting neutral outcomes and others leaning towards a negative outlook for Apple due to this news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
