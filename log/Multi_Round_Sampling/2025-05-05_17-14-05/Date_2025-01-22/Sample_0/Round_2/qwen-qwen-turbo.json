(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and its implications for the semiconductor industry. Apple's stock price is indirectly affected by Intel's uncertainties, given their connection in the tech supply chain. With Intel's stock facing turbulence due to leadership challenges, it may create a cautious outlook in the semiconductor sector, including Apple. However, Apple has shown resilience and strong fundamentals, which may counteract negative sentiments related to Intel. Thus, while there is concern about Intel's future impacting the broader market, Apple's intrinsic strengths suggest a lower probability of stock decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings, implying an upcoming earnings announcement. Earnings announcements are typically volatile periods for stock prices, with the movement depending on whether the reported earnings and forward guidance beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. The news doesn't provide specific information about those expectations or any indication about whether Apple is likely to outperform or underperform. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned close to 50% with a slight preference to the rise, as Apple is historically a company that often beats expectations. The segment focusing on small caps and hedging strategies doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, although overall market sentiment can influence it. Given the rally in small caps, there may be some broader economic stability implied that could positively impact Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the company's earnings projections are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue,  the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is concerning.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests neither significant buying nor selling pressure.  The high forward P/E and PEG ratios indicate the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry. The positive industry ranking provides some support. Overall, the positive earnings outlook is countered by valuation concerns and recent underperformance.  Given the mixed signals, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the positive earnings forecast, but the risk is not negligible given the current valuation and market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement with Indonesia to lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales, which was imposed due to non-compliance with local content requirements. The resolution of this issue would allow Apple to re-enter one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting sales and revenue. This positive development is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, leading to increased confidence in the stock. However, the stock price movement may also depend on broader market conditions and other company-specific factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive sentiment and potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly indicate a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The news primarily discusses small caps and a strategy for hedging against downside risk using options on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). It mentions Apple's earnings but does not provide any specific information that would lead to a significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, given that the question is about whether to buy the stock before the event, it implies that there might be some positive expectation or speculation around the event, which could lead to a rise in stock price. Nonetheless, the absence of concrete details means the impact could go either way, so the probabilities assigned reflect a moderate inclination towards a positive outcome due to the speculative nature of the headline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive advantage in the smartphone market. This could lead to increased market share for Samsung, which may negatively impact Apple's sales. However, Apple is planning to introduce its own ultrathin model later in the year, which might mitigate some of the negative effects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Intel's leadership challenges, which do not have a direct negative impact on Apple's stock. However, as Intel is a significant player in the semiconductor supply chain, uncertainties surrounding its CEO search could create cautious sentiment in the tech sector. That said, Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience provide a buffer against potential negative sentiments. Additionally, the broader market context remains moderately optimistic, potentially leaning towards a slight upward movement for Apple. Given the significant uncertainty regarding Intel's future leadership and strategy, I estimate a modest probability of a stock price rise, while considering the cautious outlook from the market could lead to a probability of decline as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on how to play small caps using options strategies, with a brief mention of how investors might want to play Apple's earnings. The small cap discussion is not directly relevant to Apple, but the earnings mention is. Without specific details about analyst expectations or hints about whether Apple might beat or miss, it's difficult to gauge the likely direction. The previous models generally hovered around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall, reflecting uncertainty. Given that earnings are mentioned, suggesting an imminent announcement, and in line with recent consensus, I'll slightly favor a rise due to Apple's historical tendency to meet or exceed expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings show growth, the stock's recent underperformance relative to the market and sector is a concern.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) is neutral.  High P/E and PEG ratios suggest overvaluation. However, the positive industry ranking offers some support. Positive earnings forecasts are offset by valuation concerns and recent underperformance. The consensus EPS projection remained stagnant over the past 30 days, indicating a lack of significant positive momentum from analyst revisions. Previous model predictions are quite varied, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, highlighting uncertainty. Considering all factors, the slight upward trend in earnings projections and the generally positive industry outlook slightly favor a rise, but the valuation concerns and recent underperformance temper this optimism.  The near-term uncertainty around earnings announcement adds to the overall volatility.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement with Indonesia to lift a sales ban on the iPhone 16 series, which was imposed due to non-compliance with local content requirements. This resolution would allow Apple to re-enter one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting sales and revenue. The positive sentiment from this development is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, leading to increased confidence in the stock. However, the stock price movement may also depend on broader market conditions and other company-specific factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss small caps and hedging strategies but also mention Apple's earnings. There is no direct information about Apple's future performance or any specific factors that would cause the stock price to rise or fall significantly. However, the mention of Apple's earnings could imply potential volatility around the earnings announcement. Given that earnings announcements often lead to positive surprises for Apple, there's a slight bias towards a positive movement. The overall market sentiment and the discussion around small caps do not provide direct negative indicators for Apple. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned with a slight preference towards a rise, reflecting Apple's historical performance and the potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, some of which were based on different news content, it's essential to focus on the current headline. The speculative nature of the headline implies that there might be some positive expectation or speculation around the event, which could lead to a rise in stock price. However, without concrete details, the impact could go either way. Given the historical resilience and strong fundamentals of Apple, and considering the balance of previous predictions, a moderate inclination towards a positive outcome seems reasonable. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than that of falling, reflecting the uncertainty and the potential for positive news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive advantage. This could impact Apple's market share negatively, leading to potential investor concerns about Apple's performance in the ultrathin smartphone category. However, it's noted that Apple is planning its own ultrathin model for later in the year, which could help mitigate some of the negative effects. Previous predictions show varied sentiments, with some predicting neutral outcomes and others leaning towards a negative outlook for Apple due to this news.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
