(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and its implications for the semiconductor industry. Apple's stock price is indirectly affected by Intel's uncertainties, given their connection in the tech supply chain. With Intel's stock facing turbulence due to leadership challenges, it may create a cautious outlook in the semiconductor sector, including Apple. However, Apple has shown resilience and strong fundamentals, which may counteract negative sentiments related to Intel. Thus, while there is concern about Intel's future impacting the broader market, Apple's intrinsic strengths suggest a lower probability of stock decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings, implying an upcoming earnings announcement. Earnings announcements are typically volatile periods for stock prices, with the movement depending on whether the reported earnings and forward guidance beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. The news doesn't provide specific information about those expectations or any indication about whether Apple is likely to outperform or underperform. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned close to 50% with a slight preference to the rise, as Apple is historically a company that often beats expectations. The segment focusing on small caps and hedging strategies doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, although overall market sentiment can influence it. Given the rally in small caps, there may be some broader economic stability implied that could positively impact Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the company's earnings projections are positive, showing growth in EPS and revenue,  the stock's recent underperformance compared to the market and sector is concerning.  The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests neither significant buying nor selling pressure.  The high forward P/E and PEG ratios indicate the stock is trading at a premium compared to its industry. The positive industry ranking provides some support. Overall, the positive earnings outlook is countered by valuation concerns and recent underperformance.  Given the mixed signals, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the positive earnings forecast, but the risk is not negligible given the current valuation and market context.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is nearing an agreement with Indonesia to lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales, which was imposed due to non-compliance with local content requirements. The resolution of this issue would allow Apple to re-enter one of the largest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting sales and revenue. This positive development is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, leading to increased confidence in the stock. However, the stock price movement may also depend on broader market conditions and other company-specific factors not mentioned in the news. Given the positive sentiment and potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly indicate a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The news primarily discusses small caps and a strategy for hedging against downside risk using options on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). It mentions Apple's earnings but does not provide any specific information that would lead to a significant stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there may be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, given that the question is about whether to buy the stock before the event, it implies that there might be some positive expectation or speculation around the event, which could lead to a rise in stock price. Nonetheless, the absence of concrete details means the impact could go either way, so the probabilities assigned reflect a moderate inclination towards a positive outcome due to the speculative nature of the headline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive advantage in the smartphone market. This could lead to increased market share for Samsung, which may negatively impact Apple's sales. However, Apple is planning to introduce its own ultrathin model later in the year, which might mitigate some of the negative effects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
