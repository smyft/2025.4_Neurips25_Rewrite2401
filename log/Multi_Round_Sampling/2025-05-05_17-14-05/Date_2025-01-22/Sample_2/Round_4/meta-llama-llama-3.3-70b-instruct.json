(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, with a 13.77% decline. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing modest growth; however, the lack of upward revisions in analyst estimates reflects uncertainty. The market's overall sentiment seems cautious, leaning towards a hold rating from Zacks. Given these factors, the probability of a rise is moderate, while the likelihood of a fall is also present due to previous underperformance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of a new Apple store opening is generally a positive sign, indicating business expansion and brand strength. The emphasis on environmental sustainability and accessibility also aligns with current consumer preferences and can improve brand image. The mention of 'iPhone 16' suggests that the news occurred some time after that device's release and doesn't indicate anything novel. The 'Today at Apple' sessions and integration with the local community help create loyal consumers and adds to long term growth. The probability of the stock rising as a direct event on a company as large and ubiquitous as Apple is minimal since its is expected. However the factors point to a positive longer trajectory.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  While Apple's stock fell 3% the previous session, this article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. Therefore, any price movement is likely to be driven by broader market factors, rather than news directly related to Apple.  The probability of a rise or fall is therefore assumed to be relatively close to 50/50, reflecting that there's no significant news affecting Apple's future directly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's search for a new CEO and its internal struggles, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO could imply a minor indirect impact if Srouji were to leave Apple, which is unlikely. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's operations or financial performance, the news is neutral for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, highlighting the loyalty of Apple users. Buffett's statement that no one would take $10,000 to stop buying iPhones forever underscores the strong brand loyalty. However, the article also mentions recent challenges faced by Apple, such as a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Despite these challenges, Buffett's overall positive sentiment towards Apple and the unique ecosystem of iPhones could support the stock price. The recent 25% reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake might be perceived negatively, but it also reflects Buffett's value investing strategy. Overall, the positive remarks by Buffett and the emphasis on customer loyalty are likely to have a more significant impact than the negative sales data and competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to this new category. This development may impact Apple's sales and market share in the smartphone industry. The fact that Samsung is launching a thinner phone first could give it a competitive edge, potentially affecting Apple's stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Apple typically unveils its new phones in September, and the market's reaction to this news may be nuanced, taking into account various factors such as Apple's brand loyalty, innovation, and overall market performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, finally ending up in Shenzhen, China. The news focuses more on the issue of smartphone theft and the effectiveness of local law enforcement rather than directly impacting Apple's business performance or financial health. While the incident highlights security measures like Apple's Activation Lock, which showcases technological advancement and security, the primary concern expressed revolves around inadequate law enforcement action. This type of security issue could potentially impact consumer trust, but given Apple\u2019s strong brand and market position, the direct financial impact is likely minimal. The news could also draw attention to Apple's market share and robust security features, which might lead to slightly positive sentiments. However, the overall market reaction might not be significantly influenced unless there's widespread perception that such incidents could affect product sales, which is unlikely.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Apple's stock has shown a slight daily gain but has underperformed the broader market indices significantly over the past month, with a notable 13.77% decline. The upcoming earnings report, scheduled for January 30, 2025, presents uncertainties despite a projected EPS growth of 8.26%. The lack of consensus EPS revisions indicates a cautious sentiment among analysts, reflected in a 'Hold' rating. Furthermore, the valuation metrics suggest that while Apple maintains a strong brand loyalty, its premium valuation could present headwinds in the current market context. Given these mixed signals and the trend of analyst sentiment, there arises substantial uncertainty around the stock's potential movement post-earnings report. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but a significant likelihood of it continuing to fall, driven by the recent underperformance and market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news of a new Apple store opening is generally a positive indicator, suggesting expansion and brand strength. The store design emphasizes environmental sustainability and accessibility, aligning with current consumer values. The reference to 'iPhone 16' implies the news is sometime after its release, offering no surprise there but rather sustained market presence. The 'Today at Apple' sessions contribute to customer loyalty and long-term growth. Given these factors and considering that Apple's stock usually sees minimal impact from events like these -- it is a given (baked-in) that a well-oiled machine company like Apple will continue what they are doing such as opening a store -- I anticipate a slightly positive impact, leaning more toward a holding pattern with a slight nudge upwards. Considering the range from previous estimates, I'll adjust from the initial 0.6 to factor in what has already happened in the past few days such as a stock decrease -- thereby giving a more realistic number.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on other companies, particularly Nvidia's rise to become the world's most valuable company, surpassing Apple.  While Apple is mentioned in the context of this market cap shift and a 3% drop in its share price the previous session, there is no company-specific news directly impacting Apple's prospects in this article. The news about Nvidia's success (driven by AI investments) and positive developments in other sectors (Oracle, Netflix, Adidas) may signal broader market trends, whereas for Apple the news is essentially negative by highlighting its recent underperformance.  However, this is not likely to cause a significant shift in Apple's stock price, and any movement would probably be more influenced by external factors such as overall market sentiment rather than this specific article.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly toward a fall, reflecting the negative context of Apple's recent market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's internal struggles and CEO search, with only a tangential mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO. This does not directly impact Apple's operations or financial performance. The news is neutral for AAPL, as it does not provide any significant positive or negative information about Apple. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, highlighting the loyalty of Apple users. Buffett's statement that no one would take $10,000 to stop buying iPhones forever underscores the strong brand loyalty. However, the article also mentions recent challenges faced by Apple, such as a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Despite these challenges, Buffett's overall positive sentiment towards Apple and the unique ecosystem of iPhones could support the stock price. The recent 25% reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake might be perceived negatively, but it also reflects Buffett's value investing strategy. Overall, the positive remarks by Buffett and the emphasis on customer loyalty are likely to have a more significant impact than the negative sales data and competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to this new category. This development may impact Apple's sales and market share in the smartphone industry. Considering the competitive edge Samsung may gain, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher. However, it's essential to consider Apple's brand loyalty, innovation, and overall market performance, which may mitigate the negative impact. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the potential competitive threat from Samsung's new product.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple's recent stock performance has lagged behind broader market indices and indicates a loss of 13.77% over the past month. While the upcoming earnings report could show modest growth in EPS and revenue, the stagnant analyst estimates and a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggest caution. Additionally, the high Forward P/E ratio relative to the industry points to overvaluation risks. Consequently, it appears that overall sentiment leans towards potential further declines, while the likelihood of a stock price increase is constrained by mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the opening of a new Apple store in Miami. This is generally a positive event, indicating company expansion and investment. The design of the store emphasizes sustainability and accessibility. The mention of 'iPhone 16' indicates that this article occurs after the release of this product and might not be a new product announcement. The inclusion of community engagement through 'Today at Apple' sessions also contributes positively. Overall, this should be seen as a slight positive factor, but with limited direct impact on Apple's gigantic capitalization and expected growth. Considering the previous predictions, with fluctuations based on market sentiments and earlier negative news regarding market cap shifts and competition from Samsung, and factoring the slighty more positive aspects within this particular news, my prediction will lean towards a neutral to slight positive impact. However, given the maturity of the company and store openings being rather normal operation events, the impact is limited. Also note that I am unsure on the impact of the previous models predicting very low rising possibility.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies' performance and doesn't contain any significant positive or negative news directly impacting Apple.  Apple is mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization and experiencing a 3% drop the previous session.  This context is negative, but the absence of specific Apple-related news suggests that broader market forces will be more influential in determining AAPL's price movement. Previous predictions are mixed and don't offer a clear consensus.  The relative lack of directly relevant news combined with the previous day's 3% drop tilts the probabilities slightly towards a fall, but the overall uncertainty warrants probabilities close to 50/50. I've also considered the range and reasoning of the previous predictions to arrive at a more balanced and informed estimation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's internal struggles and CEO search, with only a tangential mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO. This does not directly impact Apple's operations or financial performance. The news is neutral for AAPL, as it does not provide any significant positive or negative information about Apple. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, highlighting the loyalty of Apple users.

This development may impact Apple's sales and market share in the smartphone industry. Considering the competitive edge Samsung may gain, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher. However, it's essential to consider Apple's brand loyalty, innovation, and overall market performance, which may mitigate the negative impact. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the potential competitive threat from Samsung's new product. Based on the analysis of previous predictions, there is a general consensus that the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, due to the competitive threat from Samsung's new product.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, finally ending up in Shenzhen, China. The news focuses more on the issue of smartphone theft and the effectiveness of local law enforcement rather than directly impacting Apple's business performance or financial health. While the incident highlights security measures like Apple's Activation Lock, which showcases technological advancement and security, the primary concern expressed revolves around inadequate law enforcement action. This type of security issue could potentially impact consumer trust, but given Apple\u2019s strong brand and market position, the direct financial impact is likely minimal. The news could also draw attention to Apple's market share and robust security features, which might lead to slightly positive sentiments. However, the overall market reaction might not be significantly influenced unless there's widespread perception that such incidents could affect product sales, which is unlikely.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is currently experiencing a slight daily gain, but has significantly underperformed the broader market over the past month. The upcoming earnings report brings some uncertainty, and the lack of upward revisions in analyst estimates reflects a cautious sentiment. Apple's high Forward P/E ratio suggests potential overvaluation risks in comparison to its peers. As such, while there may be some minor positive factors, the overall sentiment appears tilted towards a potential decline in stock price, given the recent underperformance against market indices and lack of additional positive developments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of Apple opening a new store in Miami is typically a positive signal, indicating expansion and investment. The store's emphasis on sustainability, accessibility, and community engagement (through 'Today at Apple' sessions) aligns with current consumer values. Mentioning the iPhone 16 suggests a period after its release, highlighting sustained market presence and relevance. While such store openings are common for a company like Apple, it contributes to maintaining brand image and customer experience. However, considering the previous predictions: some showed a negative slant related to recent underperformance versus market indices and competition and previous market cap shifts. Taking all of this into account, and recognizing that a single store opening is unlikely to dramatically affect Apple's vast market capitalization, leads to a slightly positive or neutral outlook. It is also important to note the previous rounds of predictions, where most models seemed to believe the stock price would fall based on other information, this may be something to keep in mind. The fact that the other news seemed to be 'lagging' indicates this current news will be more relevant, which favors an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on other companies' performance, primarily Nvidia's market capitalization surge and positive developments for Oracle, Netflix, and Adidas.  Apple is mentioned only in the context of being overtaken by Nvidia and experiencing a recent 3% stock drop.  This lack of direct, company-specific news for Apple suggests that its stock's movement will likely be driven by broader market trends rather than any direct impact from the article. The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating significant uncertainty.  While some models project a slight increase in probability due to brand loyalty and past performance, the general consensus leans toward a higher probability of a fall due to Apple's underperformance against market indices, particularly considering the news highlights Nvidia's success in the AI sector which might shift investor focus and capital away from Apple.  Considering the lack of positive Apple-specific news, the overall market sentiment (potentially negative due to the Nvidia focus), and the previous predictions' spread, a slightly higher probability of a fall is assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's internal struggles and CEO search, with only a tangential mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO. This does not directly impact Apple's operations or financial performance. The news is neutral for AAPL, as it does not provide any significant positive or negative information about Apple. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is minimal. Previous predictions also indicate a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, but the overall impact is negligible.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, highlighting the loyalty of Apple users.
