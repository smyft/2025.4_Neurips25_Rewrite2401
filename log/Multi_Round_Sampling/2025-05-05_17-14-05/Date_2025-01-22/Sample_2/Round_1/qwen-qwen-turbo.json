(AAPL)\nNews Headline: A Mother Tracks Her Son's Stolen iPhone On An 8,000-Mile Trip From NYC To Shenzhen, China \u2013 Here's What Irks Her More Than Losing The Phone\nNews Content: When a mother in New York City realized her son's iPhone was missing, she did what many parents would do \u2013 she immediately opened Apple's Find My app to track the device. What she discovered was both frustrating and fascinating, as the stolen iPhone went on an international adventure highlighting just how organized the black market for stolen electronics has become.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nFrom NYC to Shenzhen\n\nThe phone's journey began on Oct. 30 in NYC when it was snatched. First, it appeared in an apartment complex in the Bronx, then sat in a Long Island warehouse for a few days. Months later, it resurfaced nearly 8,000 miles away in Shenzhen, China, a well-known city hub for electronics manufacturing and repair.\n\nBy this point, the device was locked and useless to whoever had it, thanks to Apple's Activation Lock \u2013 a feature designed to prevent thieves from resetting and reselling stolen phones. Despite this, the phone's destination made sense. Shenzhen is home to Huaqiangbei, a sprawling electronics market where stolen phones are dismantled for parts or reassembled into \u201cnew\u201d devices.\n\nThe Scale of the Problem\n\nSmartphone theft is a widespread issue in the United States. Allstate estimates that 5% or an estimated 14.7 million phones were stolen in 2023 alone. Since iPhones make up about 50% of the smartphone market in the U.S., this translates to approximately 7.35 million stolen iPhones in a year. The financial damage is immense, not just in the cost of the devices but also in the security risks posed by potential data breaches.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nWhat Frustrated Her Most\n\nOddly enough, losing the iPhone wasn't the most infuriating part of the ordeal. What truly upset the mother was the lack of interest from local authorities. She filed a police report with the NYPD immediately after the theft, but the response was underwhelming. Even when the phone's location was trackable in NYC, nothing was done to investigate.\n\n\"I'm not that mad about losing this one phone,\" she shared, \"but I wish the NYPD had looked into the Long Island warehouse before it left NY. I bet there are a ton of other phones going through this same path.\" Her frustration resonated with others online, as many shared similar stories of police apathy toward stolen phones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs one person said, \u201cAnd I thought only in India police are not interested in stolen phone cases. Well, this has been the same for the entire world. Looks like a nexus to bring the phone to China where tracking is difficult because of the poor treaty.\u201d\n\nAnother tried explaining things further: \u201cPeople don't understand that filing a police report is literally just a report. It's not a request for the police to look into it or a declaration by the police that they will look into it.\u201d\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nHow the Black Market Thrives\n\nShenzhen's Huaqiangbei district has become a hotbed for dismantling stolen devices. While Apple's Activation Lock, part of its Stolen Device Protection measures, makes it nearly impossible to reuse an iPhone, individual components like screens, batteries and chips can still be salvaged and sold.\n\nIn some cases, thieves even scam the original owners into removing the Activation Lock by sending fake messages claiming to be from Apple. Or, as someone said, \u201cHe'll start getting messages from someone claiming that they bought it and need him to remove the activation lock. Don't do it. Block and ignore. Eventually, they'll start threatening him. Again, ignore. They can't do anything.\u201d\n\nOrganized networks route phones from theft hotspots like NYC to international markets, with Shenzhen being one of the biggest destinations.\n\nThese operations are so well-oiled that stolen phones are often shipped in bulk, passing through intermediaries.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMany are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, with a 13.77% decline. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing modest growth; however, the lack of upward revisions in analyst estimates reflects uncertainty. The market's overall sentiment seems cautious, leaning towards a hold rating from Zacks. Given these factors, the probability of a rise is moderate, while the likelihood of a fall is also present due to previous underperformance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of a new Apple store opening is generally a positive sign, indicating business expansion and brand strength. The emphasis on environmental sustainability and accessibility also aligns with current consumer preferences and can improve brand image. The mention of 'iPhone 16' suggests that the news occurred some time after that device's release and doesn't indicate anything novel. The 'Today at Apple' sessions and integration with the local community help create loyal consumers and adds to long term growth. The probability of the stock rising as a direct event on a company as large and ubiquitous as Apple is minimal since its is expected. However the factors point to a positive longer trajectory.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  While Apple's stock fell 3% the previous session, this article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. Therefore, any price movement is likely to be driven by broader market factors, rather than news directly related to Apple.  The probability of a rise or fall is therefore assumed to be relatively close to 50/50, reflecting that there's no significant news affecting Apple's future directly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Intel's search for a new CEO and its internal struggles, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the mention of Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO could imply a minor indirect impact if Srouji were to leave Apple, which is unlikely. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's operations or financial performance, the news is neutral for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, highlighting the loyalty of Apple users. Buffett's statement that no one would take $10,000 to stop buying iPhones forever underscores the strong brand loyalty. However, the article also mentions recent challenges faced by Apple, such as a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Despite these challenges, Buffett's overall positive sentiment towards Apple and the unique ecosystem of iPhones could support the stock price. The recent 25% reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake might be perceived negatively, but it also reflects Buffett's value investing strategy. Overall, the positive remarks by Buffett and the emphasis on customer loyalty are likely to have a more significant impact than the negative sales data and competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially beating Apple to this new category. This development may impact Apple's sales and market share in the smartphone industry. The fact that Samsung is launching a thinner phone first could give it a competitive edge, potentially affecting Apple's stock price. However, it's essential to consider that Apple typically unveils its new phones in September, and the market's reaction to this news may be nuanced, taking into account various factors such as Apple's brand loyalty, innovation, and overall market performance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, finally ending up in Shenzhen, China. The news focuses more on the issue of smartphone theft and the effectiveness of local law enforcement rather than directly impacting Apple's business performance or financial health. While the incident highlights security measures like Apple's Activation Lock, which showcases technological advancement and security, the primary concern expressed revolves around inadequate law enforcement action. This type of security issue could potentially impact consumer trust, but given Apple\u2019s strong brand and market position, the direct financial impact is likely minimal. The news could also draw attention to Apple's market share and robust security features, which might lead to slightly positive sentiments. However, the overall market reaction might not be significantly influenced unless there's widespread perception that such incidents could affect product sales, which is unlikely.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
