(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Salesforce's competition with Microsoft and highlights Salesforce's recent success with their AI offerings. While the bullish sentiment around AI could positively influence tech stocks overall, the commentary does not relate directly to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, the skepticism from analysts suggests potential caution in the market, but it likely affects Salesforce more than Apple. Consequently, without direct implications for Apple, the probabilities reflect general market conditions rather than specific changes for AAPL. There is a balanced sentiment that reflects uncertainty, hence a higher chance of stability with slightly increased risk of a downturn due to the competition in the tech space.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is mixed but leans slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While it focuses on Cash App and lists AAPL as a 'Cash App stock' due to Apple Pay and Wallet, the core of the article highlights Apple's strong financials, revenue growth, and dominance in its market. The mention of record revenue and growth in key segments and emerging markets are positive catalysts. The association with Cash App, and hedge fund interest are smaller positives. The negativity comes from a broader context that in the article, it shows CDT Capital stated that 'The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing'. The 'math just isn't 'mathing' suggesting the company is overvalued. Also the article implies that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns compared to AAPL. The article mentions the company ranks 2nd on the 'best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds'. A mention as the 2nd best company is a bit subjective. Overall, the negative news of Block's legal issues affects the Cash App, but will not significantly affect Apple's stock. Weighing these factors, a slight rise in probability is suggested due to the good financial performance of Apple and dominance in revenue, offset by the mention that better AI stocks are available.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong performance, including record revenue and growth in key segments like iPhone and Services.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best cash app stocks' suggests positive investor sentiment. However, the article also acknowledges that other AI stocks are considered more promising by some investors, and Apple's inclusion is second on the list, implying a relatively high but not the highest level of predicted growth within that particular context.  The article's focus is on the Cash App's ecosystem, with Apple's presence within it highlighted as a positive for the company. While the overall tone is positive regarding Apple's financial health, the comparison to other AI stocks tempers the overtly bullish outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered higher, but not overwhelmingly so, given the nuanced perspective presented in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is entering the AR glasses market in partnership with Google, which could intensify competition in the AR space where Apple is also a key player. While Apple has been more guarded about its AR plans, the entry of a strong competitor like Samsung could be perceived as a negative for Apple's future market share in AR. However, Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and existing product pipeline (e.g., Vision Pro) may mitigate concerns. The market might view this as a neutral to slightly negative development for Apple in the short term, as it introduces more competition but does not directly impact Apple's current products or financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had led to a ban on iPhone 16 sales in the country. A resolution is expected to allow Apple to access the Indonesian market again, potentially leading to increased sales. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it removes a significant obstacle to sales in a major market. The company's decision to increase its investment in Indonesia and the reported progress in negotiations are likely to be seen as positive steps. Therefore, I expect the stock price to rise due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses using options to play small caps and Apple earnings, but it does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or earnings. However, it mentions that small caps have rallied about 18% over the last year, which could be seen as a positive indicator for the market. Additionally, the article suggests hedging against the downside by buying puts on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, which implies some uncertainty in the market. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's earnings, the impact on the stock price is uncertain. However, the overall tone of the article is neutral, and the suggestion to hedge against the downside implies that the market may be expecting some volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive edge in the smartphone market. This could lead to increased market share for Samsung, which may negatively impact Apple's sales. However, Apple is planning its own ultrathin iPhone version by September, but this might be seen as a delayed response by investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
