(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Salesforce's competition with Microsoft and highlights Salesforce's recent success with their AI offerings. While the bullish sentiment around AI could positively influence tech stocks overall, the commentary does not relate directly to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, the skepticism from analysts suggests potential caution in the market, but it likely affects Salesforce more than Apple. Consequently, without direct implications for Apple, the probabilities reflect general market conditions rather than specific changes for AAPL. There is a balanced sentiment that reflects uncertainty, hence a higher chance of stability with slightly increased risk of a downturn due to the competition in the tech space.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is mixed but leans slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While it focuses on Cash App and lists AAPL as a 'Cash App stock' due to Apple Pay and Wallet, the core of the article highlights Apple's strong financials, revenue growth, and dominance in its market. The mention of record revenue and growth in key segments and emerging markets are positive catalysts. The association with Cash App, and hedge fund interest are smaller positives. The negativity comes from a broader context that in the article, it shows CDT Capital stated that 'The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing'. The 'math just isn't 'mathing' suggesting the company is overvalued. Also the article implies that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns compared to AAPL. The article mentions the company ranks 2nd on the 'best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds'. A mention as the 2nd best company is a bit subjective. Overall, the negative news of Block's legal issues affects the Cash App, but will not significantly affect Apple's stock. Weighing these factors, a slight rise in probability is suggested due to the good financial performance of Apple and dominance in revenue, offset by the mention that better AI stocks are available.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong performance, including record revenue and growth in key segments like iPhone and Services.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best cash app stocks' suggests positive investor sentiment. However, the article also acknowledges that other AI stocks are considered more promising by some investors, and Apple's inclusion is second on the list, implying a relatively high but not the highest level of predicted growth within that particular context.  The article's focus is on the Cash App's ecosystem, with Apple's presence within it highlighted as a positive for the company. While the overall tone is positive regarding Apple's financial health, the comparison to other AI stocks tempers the overtly bullish outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered higher, but not overwhelmingly so, given the nuanced perspective presented in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is entering the AR glasses market in partnership with Google, which could intensify competition in the AR space where Apple is also a key player. While Apple has been more guarded about its AR plans, the entry of a strong competitor like Samsung could be perceived as a negative for Apple's future market share in AR. However, Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and existing product pipeline (e.g., Vision Pro) may mitigate concerns. The market might view this as a neutral to slightly negative development for Apple in the short term, as it introduces more competition but does not directly impact Apple's current products or financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news suggests that Apple is close to resolving a dispute with Indonesia that had led to a ban on iPhone 16 sales in the country. A resolution is expected to allow Apple to access the Indonesian market again, potentially leading to increased sales. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it removes a significant obstacle to sales in a major market. The company's decision to increase its investment in Indonesia and the reported progress in negotiations are likely to be seen as positive steps. Therefore, I expect the stock price to rise due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses using options to play small caps and Apple earnings, but it does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or earnings. However, it mentions that small caps have rallied about 18% over the last year, which could be seen as a positive indicator for the market. Additionally, the article suggests hedging against the downside by buying puts on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, which implies some uncertainty in the market. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's earnings, the impact on the stock price is uncertain. However, the overall tone of the article is neutral, and the suggestion to hedge against the downside implies that the market may be expecting some volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive edge in the smartphone market. This could lead to increased market share for Samsung, which may negatively impact Apple's sales. However, Apple is planning its own ultrathin iPhone version by September, but this might be seen as a delayed response by investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Salesforce's competition with Microsoft, with no direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the competitive landscape in AI tools could create a cautious atmosphere in the tech sector, Apple's fundamentals and market positioning remain strong, as it is not directly impacted by the developments discussed. The mixed sentiment and competitive criticisms do raise concerns, but they do not specifically address Apple's market position or performance. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher chance of stability in AAPL's price, with a marginal risk of a downturn due to the broader tech competition narrative.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed view of Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Apple's strong financial performance with record revenue, iPhone revenue, and service revenue growth. Its inclusion in a list of 'best cash app stocks' and strong hedge fund interest (158 holders) is also a positive signal. However, it's mentioned as the second on the list. More importantly, there is negative sentiment concerning AI; Although Apple has its own AI strategy, the AI performance is viewed as over-valuated at the current market capitalization. Furthermore, legal implications such as the Block's settlement with the CFPB regarding Cash App, as well as the fine for money laundery may decrease confidence for fin-tech or fintech-involved investors, which could slightly affect AAPL's stock price. Considering these factors and other's predictions leaning toward a slight rise, balanced with concerns of negative information, the likelihood of a price rise is considered as the same as it will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. While it highlights Apple's strong financial performance, record revenue, and growth in key segments, the context is primarily focused on Cash App and its parent company, Block.  Apple's inclusion in a list of 'best Cash App stocks' is a minor positive, but its ranking of second place suggests other companies are perceived as having greater potential. The article also indirectly mentions some skepticism regarding the overvaluation of tech companies due to AI hype, which could affect investor sentiment in the tech sector broadly, including Apple.  The legal issues faced by Block, Cash App's parent company, are largely irrelevant to Apple's performance. Previous model predictions vary widely, showing uncertainty in the market.  Considering the positive financial results juxtaposed against the overall market sentiment and the indirect negative implications from competitive AI stocks, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price increase due to Apple's strong fundamentals, but this increase is moderated by the contextual information provided.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is entering the AR glasses market in partnership with Google, which introduces new competition for Apple in the AR space. While Apple has been developing its own AR products, such as the Vision Pro, the entry of a strong competitor like Samsung could be perceived as a negative for Apple's future market share and growth potential in this emerging market. However, Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and existing product pipeline may mitigate some concerns. The market might view this as a neutral to slightly negative development for Apple in the short term, as it introduces more competition but does not directly impact Apple's current products or financials. Given the mixed sentiment from previous predictions and the competitive nature of the news, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight tilt towards a potential decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple is near an agreement with Indonesia to lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it removes a significant obstacle to sales in a major market. The company's decision to increase its investment in Indonesia and the reported progress in negotiations are likely to be seen as positive steps. Therefore, I expect the stock price to rise due to this news. Considering the positive impact of resolving the dispute and the potential for increased sales in Indonesia, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses using options to play small caps and Apple earnings, but it does not provide any direct information about Apple's financial performance or earnings. However, it mentions that small caps have rallied about 18% over the last year, which could be seen as a positive indicator for the market. Additionally, the article suggests hedging against the downside by buying puts on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, which implies some uncertainty in the market. Given the lack of specific information about Apple's earnings, the impact on the stock price is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a high probability of it falling. However, most models agree that the news does not have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I will estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on the general market conditions and the lack of specific information about Apple's earnings.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Samsung will launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone before Apple does, potentially giving Samsung a competitive edge. This could impact consumer perceptions and lead to reduced market share for Apple, especially if consumers show preference toward the thinner design. While Apple is planning its own ultrathin version by September, it might be viewed as a delayed response by investors. Previous predictions suggest various sentiments, with some models indicating a slight rise based on other positive news for Apple, while others point to negative impacts due to competition. Considering the direct competition in product design and market timing, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be negative.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
