(AAPL)\nNews Headline: A Mother Tracks Her Son's Stolen iPhone On An 8,000-Mile Trip From NYC To Shenzhen, China \u2013 Here's What Irks Her More Than Losing The Phone\nNews Content: When a mother in New York City realized her son's iPhone was missing, she did what many parents would do \u2013 she immediately opened Apple's Find My app to track the device. What she discovered was both frustrating and fascinating, as the stolen iPhone went on an international adventure highlighting just how organized the black market for stolen electronics has become.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nFrom NYC to Shenzhen\n\nThe phone's journey began on Oct. 30 in NYC when it was snatched. First, it appeared in an apartment complex in the Bronx, then sat in a Long Island warehouse for a few days. Months later, it resurfaced nearly 8,000 miles away in Shenzhen, China, a well-known city hub for electronics manufacturing and repair.\n\nBy this point, the device was locked and useless to whoever had it, thanks to Apple's Activation Lock \u2013 a feature designed to prevent thieves from resetting and reselling stolen phones. Despite this, the phone's destination made sense. Shenzhen is home to Huaqiangbei, a sprawling electronics market where stolen phones are dismantled for parts or reassembled into \u201cnew\u201d devices.\n\nThe Scale of the Problem\n\nSmartphone theft is a widespread issue in the United States. Allstate estimates that 5% or an estimated 14.7 million phones were stolen in 2023 alone. Since iPhones make up about 50% of the smartphone market in the U.S., this translates to approximately 7.35 million stolen iPhones in a year. The financial damage is immense, not just in the cost of the devices but also in the security risks posed by potential data breaches.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nWhat Frustrated Her Most\n\nOddly enough, losing the iPhone wasn't the most infuriating part of the ordeal. What truly upset the mother was the lack of interest from local authorities. She filed a police report with the NYPD immediately after the theft, but the response was underwhelming. Even when the phone's location was trackable in NYC, nothing was done to investigate.\n\n\"I'm not that mad about losing this one phone,\" she shared, \"but I wish the NYPD had looked into the Long Island warehouse before it left NY. I bet there are a ton of other phones going through this same path.\" Her frustration resonated with others online, as many shared similar stories of police apathy toward stolen phones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs one person said, \u201cAnd I thought only in India police are not interested in stolen phone cases. Well, this has been the same for the entire world. Looks like a nexus to bring the phone to China where tracking is difficult because of the poor treaty.\u201d\n\nAnother tried explaining things further: \u201cPeople don't understand that filing a police report is literally just a report. It's not a request for the police to look into it or a declaration by the police that they will look into it.\u201d\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nHow the Black Market Thrives\n\nShenzhen's Huaqiangbei district has become a hotbed for dismantling stolen devices. While Apple's Activation Lock, part of its Stolen Device Protection measures, makes it nearly impossible to reuse an iPhone, individual components like screens, batteries and chips can still be salvaged and sold.\n\nIn some cases, thieves even scam the original owners into removing the Activation Lock by sending fake messages claiming to be from Apple. Or, as someone said, \u201cHe'll start getting messages from someone claiming that they bought it and need him to remove the activation lock. Don't do it. Block and ignore. Eventually, they'll start threatening him. Again, ignore. They can't do anything.\u201d\n\nOrganized networks route phones from theft hotspots like NYC to international markets, with Shenzhen being one of the biggest destinations.\n\nThese operations are so well-oiled that stolen phones are often shipped in bulk, passing through intermediaries.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMany are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant issue with smartphone theft in the U.S. and exposes the organized black market utilizing stolen devices. While this raises concerns about the effectiveness of local law enforcement and the broader implications of theft on consumers, it also showcases the strength of Apple's security measures, such as Activation Lock, which protects the company's brand reputation. However, the overall sentiment regarding crime and data security could have negative implications for consumer trust and market performance. The situation presented in the news might not directly influence stock prices in the short term, as it does not provide immediate implications for Apple's financial performance. Hence, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to the company\u2019s resilience and security efforts being highlighted.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple earnings, implying an upcoming earnings announcement. Earnings announcements are typically volatile periods for stock prices, with the movement depending on whether the reported earnings and forward guidance beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. The news doesn't provide specific information about those expectations or any indication about whether Apple is likely to outperform or underperform. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned close to 50% with a slight preference to the rise, as Apple is historically a company that often beats expectations. The segment focusing on small caps and hedging strategies doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, although overall market sentiment can influence it. Given the rally in small caps, there may be some broader economic stability implied that could positively impact Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is nearing a resolution to a trade dispute with Indonesia that has halted iPhone 16 sales.  Resolving this dispute would allow Apple to access a significant Southeast Asian market, boosting sales and potentially increasing revenue.  While the news is positive, the probability of a price rise isn't guaranteed.  The impact on the overall stock price will depend on several factors, including the market's overall sentiment, investor reaction to the news, and whether the resolution comes with any unforeseen financial burdens. Therefore, while a price increase is likely, it's not certain, and a small probability of a price fall or stagnation exists due to market uncertainty or other unrelated factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with Benioff criticizing Microsoft's Copilot and Nadella downplaying Salesforce's business applications. The article highlights Salesforce's strong performance in AI-related deals, particularly with its Agentforce product, which has contributed to a 25% stock price increase since its introduction. However, there is skepticism from Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who downgraded Salesforce to Sell, citing concerns about monetization and competitive advantages in AI. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive momentum from strong AI deal closures but skepticism from analysts\u2014the impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is indirect at best. Apple is not directly mentioned in the article, and the focus is on Salesforce and Microsoft. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, which implies potential for recovery. The overall sentiment seems mixed, but leaning towards being slightly negative due to the mention of being the worst-performing stock. Historically, stocks that are oversold or have significantly dropped may have a higher chance of rebounding if the company's fundamentals remain strong. Given Apple's established market presence and generally positive investor sentiment, there might be a moderate chance of the stock price rising if investors view the sell-off as an overreaction. However, the immediate trend might still be negative due to recent performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about the opening of Apple Miami Worldcenter, a new Apple store in downtown Miami, is a positive development for the company. The store's unique design, focus on accessibility, and commitment to the environment are likely to generate buzz and attract customers. Additionally, the store's offerings, including the latest Apple products and services, will likely drive sales and increase brand loyalty. This news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on the stock price, as it does not reveal any major setbacks or negative developments. Given the overall positive tone of the news, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, emphasizing the strong brand loyalty and perceived value among users. This positive sentiment could initially boost investor confidence. However, the article also notes a decline in iPhone sales in China and Buffett's decision to reduce his stake in the company, reflecting recent challenges. These factors could potentially offset some of the initial positive sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant security measures Apple has, such as Activation Lock, which enhances the brand's reputation and consumer trust despite the challenges posed by theft and the black market. While there are concerns raised about the effectiveness of local law enforcement and the implications of smartphone theft on consumer security, these issues do not have an immediate negative impact on Apple's financial outlook. The strengths of Apple's security features might positively influence consumer perception and loyalty. Overall, while the news raises important issues, the resilience of Apple's brand and its security measures are likely to lead to a slightly higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall, albeit with a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on two main points: small-cap market strategies and Apple's earnings. The small-cap discussion is less directly relevant to Apple. The mention of 'how investors may want to play Apple's (AAPL) earnings' signals potential volatility and an upcoming catalyst. Given that earnings are a major driver of stock price, and without knowing if expectations are set high or low, it is reasonable to assume that potential scenarios exist for the stock to either rise or fall. Considering the previous rounds, there's a trend of predictions varying and converging around a relatively high uncertainty regarding the direction of Apple's stock price. Based on the headline alone, I'm assigning roughly even probabilities of the stock moving up or down, pending the actual earnings data.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential resolution to a significant trade dispute between Apple and Indonesia, which had resulted in a ban on iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia.  Resolving this dispute represents a positive development for Apple, as Indonesia is a large and growing market.  Access to this market is expected to boost sales and revenue.  However, the resolution is not yet finalized, and there's always market uncertainty,  and external factors that could influence Apple's stock price independent of this news. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, some focusing on the positive impact of resolving the trade issue, others highlighting general market uncertainty or unrelated factors.  Considering the potential positive impact of resolving this significant trade issue but acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in the market, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise than a fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with Benioff criticizing Microsoft's Copilot and Nadella downplaying Salesforce's business applications.

Given the mixed signals\u2014positive momentum from strong AI deal closures but skepticism from analysts\u2014the impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is indirect at best. Apple is not directly mentioned in the article, and the focus is on Salesforce and Microsoft. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about the opening of Apple Miami Worldcenter, a new Apple store in downtown Miami, is a positive development for the company. The store's unique design, focus on accessibility, and commitment to the environment are likely to generate buzz and attract customers. Additionally, the store's offerings, including the latest Apple products and services, will likely drive sales and increase brand loyalty. This news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on the stock price, as it does not reveal any major setbacks or negative developments. Given the overall positive tone of the news and considering the mixed predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges related to smartphone theft and the efficacy of local law enforcement in addressing such issues. However, it also emphasizes the strength of Apple's security measures, particularly the Activation Lock feature, which protects customers' devices and data. While the rising concern about theft could negatively influence consumer trust, Apple's overall resilience and reputation may buffer against any immediate negative impact on the stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate a slight probability of a stock price rise due to the reinforcement of Apple\u2019s brand reputation, countered by the potential negative implications of theft on consumer sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on two aspects: small-cap strategy and Apple's upcoming earnings. The small-cap discussion is less relevant to Apple specifically, but it speaks to broader market trends. The main point is the mention of 'how investors may want to play Apple's (AAPL) earnings,' which suggests that earnings are an imminent and key factor that would drive the stock price. Given the mixed sentiments from various sources in the previous round, I am setting the probability to be close to 0.5. Notably, there are some predictions in the previous rounds that failed to deliver a result. I will consider the successfull predictions in this round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's potential resolution of the iPhone 16 sales ban in Indonesia is overwhelmingly positive.  Access to this large Southeast Asian market represents a significant revenue opportunity. While the deal isn't finalized, the optimistic tone from Indonesian officials suggests a high likelihood of success. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but several models correctly identified the positive potential of resolving the trade dispute.  While broader market factors and other news could influence Apple's stock price, this specific news item points strongly towards a price increase.  The probability of a price rise is weighted higher, acknowledging a small possibility of unforeseen complications or negative market sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with no direct mention or impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus is on Salesforce and Microsoft, and the content does not provide any material information that would influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of relevant information, the probabilities are assigned neutrally.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2025, which suggests a negative trend. However, the headline also questions if the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, implying potential for recovery. Historically, stocks that are oversold or have significantly dropped may have a higher chance of rebounding if the company's fundamentals remain strong. Given Apple's established market presence and generally positive investor sentiment, there might be a moderate chance of the stock price rising if investors view the sell-off as an overreaction. However, the immediate trend might still be negative due to recent performance. The mixed predictions from other models also suggest uncertainty, with probabilities ranging from 0.1 to 0.75 for a rise and 0.1 to 0.55 for a fall. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with significant uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about the opening of Apple Miami Worldcenter, a new Apple store in downtown Miami, is a positive development for the company. The store's unique design, focus on accessibility, and commitment to the environment are likely to generate buzz and attract customers. Additionally, the store's offerings, including the latest Apple products and services, will likely drive sales and increase brand loyalty. This news is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on the stock price, as it does not reveal any major setbacks or negative developments. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the mixed predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's admiration for Apple and its iPhones, emphasizing the strong brand loyalty and perceived value among users, which contributes to a positive sentiment. However, it also notes a decline in iPhone sales in China and Buffett's decision to reduce his stake in the company, indicating ongoing challenges. Considering the mixed signals, the recent trends from other models suggest a relatively balanced view with some models favoring an increase and others favoring a decrease. The overall sentiment leans towards a slight positive, but with caution.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's effective security measures, particularly the Activation Lock that protects users from theft, which could bolster consumer trust in the brand. However, it also outlines the significant challenges posed by smartphone theft and the black market, which might concern investors about the future implications on sales and consumer sentiment. Given the mixed nature of the news, with a slight emphasis on the strengths of Apple's security maintaining brand loyalty, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. The probabilistic figures reflect a cautious optimism amidst the concerns raised by the article.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on using options to play small caps and strategies related to Apple's earnings. The small-cap discussion is less directly relevant. The mention of 'how investors may want to play Apple's (AAPL) earnings' signals potential volatility and an upcoming key event. Considering that the earnings are a major driver of stock price movement but without further information on analysts' expectations, the price can either increase or decrease. Previously the models have converged to have a fairly uncertain view on whether the stock will rise or fall. I still believe the stock will go either way pending new information. Also note that considering the previous round of predictions, there are predictions relating to the resolution of iPhone ban from Indonesia. Some predictions from previous rounds focus on unrelated topics thus can't provide strong information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple reaching a potential agreement with Indonesia to lift the iPhone 16 sales ban is overwhelmingly positive.  This unlocks a significant market in Southeast Asia, boosting sales and likely increasing revenue.  While the deal isn't finalized, the optimistic statements from Indonesian officials suggest a high probability of success.  The previous predictions show varied opinions, some highlighting market uncertainty or unrelated factors, while others focus on the positive impact of the potential resolution.  I've weighted the probability of a price increase higher, considering the potential positive impact of this significant development, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in the market.  The consistent positive sentiment from multiple models towards this specific news item, despite differing views on other unrelated news, strengthens the probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses a war of words between Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding their respective AI products, with no direct mention or impact on Apple Inc.
