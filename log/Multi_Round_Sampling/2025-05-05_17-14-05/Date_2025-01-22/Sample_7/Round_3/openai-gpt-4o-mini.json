(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market, in collaboration with Google, intensifies competition in a sector where Apple is also a key player with its Vision Pro product. This news suggests a potential threat to Apple's market share and innovation leadership in the AR space, leading to investor caution. While there could also be a positive sentiment if Apple responds effectively to this competition, the immediate reaction might be more bearish due to increased competitive pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's shares have fallen 3% in the previous session, contributing to Nvidia surpassing it as the world's most valuable company. This suggests negative investor sentiment towards Apple. While other factors might influence Apple's stock (e.g., overall market trends or new product announcements), based solely on this news article, the negative pressure is likely to continue in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong performance, including record revenue and growth in key segments like iPhone and Services.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best cash app stocks' suggests positive investor sentiment. However, the article also acknowledges that other AI stocks are considered more promising by some investors, and Apple's inclusion is second on the list, not first.  The article mainly focuses on Cash App's performance and the broader market landscape, with Apple's inclusion more of a supporting detail than a primary focus.  While the positive financial results for Apple are noteworthy, the relatively muted focus on Apple within the context of the article suggests the impact on its stock price might not be substantial.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderately higher than the probability of a decrease, but the overall impact is likely limited based on this news alone.  Other market factors and long-term trends will have a stronger influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of Apple's iPhone, emphasizing its unparalleled customer loyalty and integration into users' lives. However, it also notes challenges, such as a significant drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Additionally, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 25%, signaling caution. Positive sentiment from Buffett's endorsement may buoy investor confidence, but the sales decline and reduced stake could weigh on the stock. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content mention several companies, but for Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant information is that Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This indicates a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term due to the comparative performance with Nvidia. However, the overall market and sector performance could influence the stock price movement. Given the information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but market dynamics and investor sentiment can quickly change this.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on or before January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be positive expectations or a significant announcement that might influence investor decisions. Given the lack of negative indicators in the headline, the probability of a rise might be slightly higher than that of a fall, but both probabilities are quite speculative without more context.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones in 2025, suggesting a decline in its stock price. Such underperformance could lead to investor concerns and potential sell-offs. However, the article poses the question of whether this might be a buying opportunity, which implies some analysts or investors view this as a chance to acquire shares at a potentially lower price. This dual perspective introduces uncertainty, but historical data and strong market position of Apple typically make such sell-offs less severe.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market, especially in partnership with Google, raises significant competitive concerns for Apple, particularly regarding its Vision Pro product. This news intensifies the competition in a sector where Apple has been attempting to establish itself, potentially threatening its market share and innovation leadership. Previous predictions indicate a generally negative sentiment toward Apple's stock particularly in light of its recent performance, where it fell behind Nvidia in market capitalization. While positive factors such as Apple's strong revenue are present, the immediate impact of this competitive threat is likely bearish. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of stock price decline compared to an increase, in the context of growing competitive pressure from established competitors like Samsung and Meta.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The primary news relevant to Apple (AAPL) is that Nvidia (NVDA) has surpassed it as the world's most valuable company, accompanied by a 3% fall in Apple's stock in the previous session. This signals a negative investor sentiment towards Apple. While the article highlights several companies, the prevailing narrative for Apple is negative relative to the significant gains achieved by Nvidia and Oracle following Trump's announced plans for the 'Stargate Project'. While Apple may have long term prospects tied to the AI sector more data will need to come out to that effect. Given a downward trend in previous predictions regarding Apple, this event is likely to further reinforce downward pressure on the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article is a mixed bag for Apple.  While it highlights Apple's strong Q4 2024 performance, record revenue, and growth in key sectors (iPhone, Services), its placement as only the *second* best Cash App stock according to hedge funds suggests some hesitancy among investors.  The article also emphasizes the significant success and challenges of Cash App itself, rather than focusing solely on Apple's prospects.  The positive aspects of Apple's financial report are counterbalanced by the larger context of the article, which does not explicitly endorse Apple as a top investment choice. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, some leaning bearish due to competition in AR/VR and the overall market sentiment regarding tech stocks. Considering the lack of strongly negative news about Apple itself in this specific article, and its generally strong financial position, the probability of a price rise is higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact is expected to be relatively small in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of Apple's iPhone, emphasizing its unparalleled customer loyalty and integration into users' lives. This positive sentiment could bolster investor confidence. However, the article also notes significant challenges, including a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo. Additionally, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 25%, which might signal caution. The mixed signals from the news\u2014strong brand loyalty versus sales decline and reduced stake\u2014suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price in the short term. Considering the previous predictions, which leaned more towards a negative impact, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares falling 3% in the previous session. This suggests a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term due to the comparative performance with Nvidia. Additionally, the news does not provide any positive indicators for Apple's stock. Therefore, based on this information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. that could impact the stock price. Given the lack of specific details about the event, it's challenging to determine the direction of the impact. However, the question implies potential positive expectations or a significant announcement that might influence investor decisions. Reviewing previous predictions, there's a mix of positive and negative sentiments towards Apple's stock price movement, reflecting various factors such as competition, market trends, and investor sentiment. The absence of negative indicators in the headline and the speculative nature of the question suggest a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but both probabilities remain speculative without more context. Considering the trend of others' beliefs and potential hidden information, a balanced approach seems appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones in 2025, with a decline of 3% in the previous session. The question posed in the news suggests a debate on whether this could be a buying opportunity. While some models predict a moderate likelihood of price decreases due to competitive pressures and market dynamics, others posit that the strong market position and potential positive events might counterbalance the negative sentiment. The current consensus among various models leans towards the possibility of continued negative investor sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market alongside Google heightens competition for Apple, particularly concerning its Vision Pro product. Given that the technology sector is volatile and competitive, this development poses a significant threat to Apple's market share. Previous predictions indicate a negative sentiment towards Apple's stock, emphasizing a decline in share price and concerns about losing its innovative edge in the AR domain. The combined negative sentiment surrounding Apple's recent performance, including falling behind Nvidia in market capitalization, supports a probabilistic assessment favoring a stock price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The primary news for Apple is negative: Nvidia has surpassed it as the world's most valuable company, and Apple's shares fell 3% in the previous session. While there are other trending tickers, the direct impact on Apple is this negative sentiment. Previous predictions have consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models factoring in increased competition and a general downward trend. Given the lack of any specific positive catalysts for Apple mentioned in the current news or highlighted by anyone else in previous rounds and continuing downward market pressure, I see more likely hood of downward motion.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple. While it highlights Apple's strong Q4 2024 performance, record revenue, and growth in key sectors, its ranking as only the second-best Cash App stock among hedge funds suggests some investor hesitancy.  The focus on Cash App's performance and challenges overshadows Apple's own positive news.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, some leaning bearish due to competition in AR/VR and overall market sentiment.  The CFPB settlement and money laundering fine for Block (Cash App's parent company) also introduce a negative element, though indirectly impacting Apple. However, Apple's robust financial performance, strong brand loyalty, and continued innovation remain significant positive factors. Considering this mixed bag of information, and the history of previous predictions showing a tendency toward more negative assessments, I am assigning a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than rise.  The impact of this specific news article is likely to be relatively small, with broader market trends holding more sway. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of the iPhone and its customer loyalty could bolster investor confidence. However, the article also highlights significant challenges, including a 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake by 25% might signal caution. Previous predictions from various models show a range of opinions, with some leaning bearish due to competitive pressures and market dynamics, while others see potential for a modest rise. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong brand loyalty versus sales decline and reduced stake\u2014the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares falling 3% in the previous session. This suggests a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term due to the comparative performance with Nvidia. Additionally, the news does not provide any positive indicators for Apple's stock. Previous predictions also lean towards a negative sentiment for Apple's stock, citing competitive pressures and market dynamics. Therefore, based on this information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' implies an upcoming event or announcement that could impact Apple's stock price. Analyzing previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions due to various factors like competition, market trends, and investor sentiment. However, a significant portion of predictions lean towards a negative impact due to increased competition in the AR/VR sector and Apple being overtaken by Nvidia as the world's most valuable company. Considering these factors and the absence of strongly positive news about Apple, the probability of the stock price falling seems slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as the worst-performing Dow Jones stock in 2025 and discusses whether this situation presents a buying opportunity. Given the consistent negative sentiments and competitive pressures highlighted in previous predictions, particularly around increased competition and market performance challenges, the overall outlook remains predominantly pessimistic. Several recent predictions have noted that the market dynamics, along with Nvidia overtaking Apple in market value, suggest a negative short-term impact on Apple\u2019s stock price. The question of whether it\u2019s a buying opportunity introduces uncertainty, but the majority of previous predictions lean towards a falling stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
