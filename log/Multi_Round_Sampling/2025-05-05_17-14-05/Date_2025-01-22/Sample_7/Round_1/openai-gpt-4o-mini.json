(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market, in collaboration with Google, intensifies competition in a sector where Apple is also a key player with its Vision Pro product. This news suggests a potential threat to Apple's market share and innovation leadership in the AR space, leading to investor caution. While there could also be a positive sentiment if Apple responds effectively to this competition, the immediate reaction might be more bearish due to increased competitive pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's shares have fallen 3% in the previous session, contributing to Nvidia surpassing it as the world's most valuable company. This suggests negative investor sentiment towards Apple. While other factors might influence Apple's stock (e.g., overall market trends or new product announcements), based solely on this news article, the negative pressure is likely to continue in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong performance, including record revenue and growth in key segments like iPhone and Services.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best cash app stocks' suggests positive investor sentiment. However, the article also acknowledges that other AI stocks are considered more promising by some investors, and Apple's inclusion is second on the list, not first.  The article mainly focuses on Cash App's performance and the broader market landscape, with Apple's inclusion more of a supporting detail than a primary focus.  While the positive financial results for Apple are noteworthy, the relatively muted focus on Apple within the context of the article suggests the impact on its stock price might not be substantial.  Therefore, the probability of a price increase is moderately higher than the probability of a decrease, but the overall impact is likely limited based on this news alone.  Other market factors and long-term trends will have a stronger influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's strong endorsement of Apple's iPhone, emphasizing its unparalleled customer loyalty and integration into users' lives. However, it also notes challenges, such as a significant drop in iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Additionally, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 25%, signaling caution. Positive sentiment from Buffett's endorsement may buoy investor confidence, but the sales decline and reduced stake could weigh on the stock. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content mention several companies, but for Apple Inc. (AAPL), the relevant information is that Nvidia has overtaken Apple to become the world's most valuable company, with Apple's shares having fallen 3% in the previous session. This indicates a negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term due to the comparative performance with Nvidia. However, the overall market and sector performance could influence the stock price movement. Given the information, there is a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, but market dynamics and investor sentiment can quickly change this.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?' suggests that there might be an upcoming event or announcement related to Apple Inc. on or before January 30, which could potentially impact the stock price. Without specific details about the event, it's difficult to determine the direction of the impact. However, the fact that the question is being asked implies there could be positive expectations or a significant announcement that might influence investor decisions. Given the lack of negative indicators in the headline, the probability of a rise might be slightly higher than that of a fall, but both probabilities are quite speculative without more context.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones in 2025, suggesting a decline in its stock price. Such underperformance could lead to investor concerns and potential sell-offs. However, the article poses the question of whether this might be a buying opportunity, which implies some analysts or investors view this as a chance to acquire shares at a potentially lower price. This dual perspective introduces uncertainty, but historical data and strong market position of Apple typically make such sell-offs less severe.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
