(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet\nNews Content: Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and strategic challenges, which primarily affect Intel's stock value rather than Apple's. The lack of a clear strategy and uncertainty regarding Intel's future could have a negative impact on technology sector sentiment, potentially affecting Apple indirectly due to its position in the semiconductor supply chain. Analysts speaking negatively about Intel's board and leadership could create broader market concerns in the tech segment. Therefore, while it's common for Apple and Intel's fortunes to be somewhat linked, the specifics of this news do not directly suggest a strong impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight tilt towards a potential rise given Apple's continued strong market position and product demand.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is underperforming within the Dow Jones, indicating negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock. However, it also frames this sell-off as a \"buying opportunity,\" implying that the current price may be undervalued. This contradictory aspect makes prediction challenging. Given the negative initial sentiment of underperformance, the probability of an immediate price drop might be slightly higher, but the explicit mention of a \"buying opportunity\" introduces uncertainty and the potential for a rebound. Further analysis is needed to assess valuation metrics and broader market trends to refine this prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  While Apple's stock fell 3% the previous session, this article doesn't provide any specific information that directly impacts Apple's future performance. The positive news surrounding AI investments and other tech companies might have an indirect, albeit weak, influence on investor sentiment affecting the broader market (possibly a minor positive effect on Apple). However, the lack of direct Apple-specific news makes it unlikely the price movement will be strongly influenced by this particular article.  Therefore, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, leaning slightly towards the possibility of a continued, minor downward trend given the previous day's drop and the overall context of Nvidia's rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news announces the opening of a new Apple store in Miami, which highlights Apple's commitment to retail expansion, customer experience, and environmental sustainability. The store features innovative design, accessibility options, and special programming, which could enhance brand perception and potentially drive incremental sales. However, the impact of a single store opening on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be minimal given the company's global scale. The news is positive but not transformative, so it may have a modest positive effect on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple Inc. to a new category. This could potentially impact Apple's market share and competitiveness in the smartphone market. Historically, investors have reacted negatively to news that suggests a company is losing its competitive edge or being outperformed by a competitor. However, Apple's planned release of its own ultrathin iPhone later this year and its strong brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly competitive to Apple's future plans rather than its current financials, so the immediate impact might be limited. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to concerns about competitiveness, but the probabilities are not drastically skewed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially compete with Apple's products in this category. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the competition is not expected to be immediate. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering that have made progress slow in this field. Considering these factors, the impact on Apple's stock price may be neutral to slightly negative in the short term, as investors may be concerned about the potential competition. However, it's also possible that Apple's stock price could rise if investors believe that the company is well-positioned to compete in this market or if they expect Apple's products to be superior to those of Samsung and Google.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones in 2025, suggesting a decline in its stock price. Such underperformance could lead potential investors to view it as a buying opportunity, possibly driving stock prices up. However, the ongoing sell-off might also prompt current shareholders to continue selling, further depressing the stock price. The balance between these two sentiments will determine the direction of the stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
