A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and strategic challenges, which primarily affect Intel's stock value rather than Apple's. The lack of a clear strategy and uncertainty regarding Intel's future could have a negative impact on technology sector sentiment, potentially affecting Apple indirectly due to its position in the semiconductor supply chain. Analysts speaking negatively about Intel's board and leadership could create broader market concerns in the tech segment. Therefore, while it's common for Apple and Intel's fortunes to be somewhat linked, the specifics of this news do not directly suggest a strong impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight tilt towards a potential rise given Apple's continued strong market position and product demand.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is underperforming within the Dow Jones, indicating negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock. However, it also frames this sell-off as a \"buying opportunity,\" implying that the current price may be undervalued. This contradictory aspect makes prediction challenging. Given the negative initial sentiment of underperformance, the probability of an immediate price drop might be slightly higher, but the explicit mention of a \"buying opportunity\" introduces uncertainty and the potential for a rebound. Further analysis is needed to assess valuation metrics and broader market trends to refine this prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  While Apple's stock fell 3% the previous session, this article doesn't provide any specific information that directly impacts Apple's future performance. The positive news surrounding AI investments and other tech companies might have an indirect, albeit weak, influence on investor sentiment affecting the broader market (possibly a minor positive effect on Apple). However, the lack of direct Apple-specific news makes it unlikely the price movement will be strongly influenced by this particular article.  Therefore, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, leaning slightly towards the possibility of a continued, minor downward trend given the previous day's drop and the overall context of Nvidia's rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news announces the opening of a new Apple store in Miami, which highlights Apple's commitment to retail expansion, customer experience, and environmental sustainability. The store features innovative design, accessibility options, and special programming, which could enhance brand perception and potentially drive incremental sales. However, the impact of a single store opening on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be minimal given the company's global scale. The news is positive but not transformative, so it may have a modest positive effect on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple Inc. to a new category. This could potentially impact Apple's market share and competitiveness in the smartphone market. Historically, investors have reacted negatively to news that suggests a company is losing its competitive edge or being outperformed by a competitor. However, Apple's planned release of its own ultrathin iPhone later this year and its strong brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly competitive to Apple's future plans rather than its current financials, so the immediate impact might be limited. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to concerns about competitiveness, but the probabilities are not drastically skewed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially compete with Apple's products in this category. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the competition is not expected to be immediate. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering that have made progress slow in this field. Considering these factors, the impact on Apple's stock price may be neutral to slightly negative in the short term, as investors may be concerned about the potential competition. However, it's also possible that Apple's stock price could rise if investors believe that the company is well-positioned to compete in this market or if they expect Apple's products to be superior to those of Samsung and Google.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones in 2025, suggesting a decline in its stock price. Such underperformance could lead potential investors to view it as a buying opportunity, possibly driving stock prices up. However, the ongoing sell-off might also prompt current shareholders to continue selling, further depressing the stock price. The balance between these two sentiments will determine the direction of the stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The lack of any specific positive news regarding Apple itself directly contributes to the likelihood of continued downward pressure or at least, a lack of upward momentum in the short term.
