A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and strategic challenges, which primarily affect Intel's stock value rather than Apple's. The lack of a clear strategy and uncertainty regarding Intel's future could have a negative impact on technology sector sentiment, potentially affecting Apple indirectly due to its position in the semiconductor supply chain. Analysts speaking negatively about Intel's board and leadership could create broader market concerns in the tech segment. Therefore, while it's common for Apple and Intel's fortunes to be somewhat linked, the specifics of this news do not directly suggest a strong impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight tilt towards a potential rise given Apple's continued strong market position and product demand.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline suggests Apple is underperforming within the Dow Jones, indicating negative sentiment and potential downward pressure on the stock. However, it also frames this sell-off as a \"buying opportunity,\" implying that the current price may be undervalued. This contradictory aspect makes prediction challenging. Given the negative initial sentiment of underperformance, the probability of an immediate price drop might be slightly higher, but the explicit mention of a \"buying opportunity\" introduces uncertainty and the potential for a rebound. Further analysis is needed to assess valuation metrics and broader market trends to refine this prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on other companies, with Apple only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization.  While Apple's stock fell 3% the previous session, this article doesn't provide any specific information that directly impacts Apple's future performance. The positive news surrounding AI investments and other tech companies might have an indirect, albeit weak, influence on investor sentiment affecting the broader market (possibly a minor positive effect on Apple). However, the lack of direct Apple-specific news makes it unlikely the price movement will be strongly influenced by this particular article.  Therefore, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, leaning slightly towards the possibility of a continued, minor downward trend given the previous day's drop and the overall context of Nvidia's rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news announces the opening of a new Apple store in Miami, which highlights Apple's commitment to retail expansion, customer experience, and environmental sustainability. The store features innovative design, accessibility options, and special programming, which could enhance brand perception and potentially drive incremental sales. However, the impact of a single store opening on Apple's overall financial performance is likely to be minimal given the company's global scale. The news is positive but not transformative, so it may have a modest positive effect on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple Inc. to a new category. This could potentially impact Apple's market share and competitiveness in the smartphone market. Historically, investors have reacted negatively to news that suggests a company is losing its competitive edge or being outperformed by a competitor. However, Apple's planned release of its own ultrathin iPhone later this year and its strong brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly competitive to Apple's future plans rather than its current financials, so the immediate impact might be limited. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to concerns about competitiveness, but the probabilities are not drastically skewed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially compete with Apple's products in this category. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the competition is not expected to be immediate. Additionally, the article highlights the challenges related to cost and engineering that have made progress slow in this field. Considering these factors, the impact on Apple's stock price may be neutral to slightly negative in the short term, as investors may be concerned about the potential competition. However, it's also possible that Apple's stock price could rise if investors believe that the company is well-positioned to compete in this market or if they expect Apple's products to be superior to those of Samsung and Google.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones in 2025, suggesting a decline in its stock price. Such underperformance could lead potential investors to view it as a buying opportunity, possibly driving stock prices up. However, the ongoing sell-off might also prompt current shareholders to continue selling, further depressing the stock price. The balance between these two sentiments will determine the direction of the stock price movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding Intel's search for a new CEO highlights significant instability and uncertainty within the company, which could have significant implications for the semiconductor industry. While this news primarily focuses on Intel, it can create a negative sentiment within the technology sector which includes Apple. The lack of a coherent strategy at Intel and ongoing acquisition rumors could lead to a cautious market environment that may indirectly affect Apple, especially if investors anticipate potential disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain. However, Apple's strong market position and ongoing demand for its products may mitigate the overall impact. Given these factors, I predict a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the prevailing uncertainties, alongside the potential for a less pronounced impact on Apple's stock price since it is indirectly affected by Intel's issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline clearly states that Apple is underperforming, which creates negative sentiment. However, the question posed in the headline, \"Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?\", introduces counter-sentiment suggesting potential undervaluation. The previous round of predictions had an average probability of the stock price rising of around 0.43 and an falling average probability of 0.5. Taking the recent negative news, I would further lower the previous average probability of stock price rising. This is in line with previous rounds beliefs/analyses, although there are always people who think the underperformance is a buying oppurtinity.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on other companies, with Apple's mention being secondary and largely negative (being overtaken by Nvidia in market capitalization and experiencing a 3% drop in the previous session).  While the positive news about AI investment and other tech companies *could* indirectly boost overall market sentiment and thus slightly benefit Apple, this effect would likely be weak and overshadowed by the direct negative news concerning Apple's recent performance and its relative standing compared to Nvidia.  The lack of any specific positive news regarding Apple itself directly contributes to the likelihood of continued downward pressure or at least, a lack of upward momentum in the short term.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a leaning toward a higher chance of a price fall, which aligns with my assessment.  Considering the overall context, a continuation of the downward trend seems more plausible than a sudden and significant upward swing.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the opening of a new Apple store in Miami, emphasizing Apple's retail expansion, customer experience, and environmental sustainability. While this is positive for brand perception and could drive incremental sales, the impact of a single store opening on Apple's overall financial performance is likely minimal given the company's global scale. The news is positive but not transformative, suggesting a modest positive effect on investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of opinions, with some leaning slightly negative due to broader market concerns or competitive pressures, but none strongly negative. Considering the positive nature of the news and the lack of significant negative factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to a new category. This could potentially impact Apple's market share and competitiveness in the smartphone market. Historically, investors have reacted negatively to news that suggests a company is losing its competitive edge or being outperformed by a competitor. However, Apple's planned release of its own ultrathin iPhone later this year and its strong brand loyalty could mitigate the negative impact. The news is more directly competitive to Apple's future plans rather than its current financials, so the immediate impact might be limited. Considering these factors, there is a slightly higher chance of the stock price falling due to concerns about competitiveness.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Samsung entering the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Google may pose a competitive threat to Apple's potential products in this category. However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the competition is not expected to be immediate. Considering the long-term nature of product development and the challenges related to cost and engineering in the field of augmented reality, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price may be minimal. The market's reaction could be neutral to slightly negative in the short term due to concerns about potential competition, but it's also possible that investors might view Apple's guarded approach as a strategic advantage, potentially leading to a rise in stock price if they believe Apple is well-positioned to compete. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher due to competition concerns, but the probabilities should not be drastically skewed.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple as the worst-performing Dow Jones stock in 2025. This underperformance suggests current investor pessimism and could trigger further selling. However, the headline explicitly refers to a potential 'buying opportunity,' which hints at possible optimistic views from some investors. While the recent performance indicates a higher likelihood of continued selling, the mention of a buying opportunity creates ambiguity. Previous predictions show mixed signals, with many models leaning towards a slight fall in stock price, though one model considers it a potential buying opportunity. Thus, there is a moderate expectation that the stock may continue to fall, given the recent trends and the current pessimistic market sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news revolves around Intel's CEO search and strategic challenges, which primarily affects Intel's stock value more than Apple's directly. However, any instability within a major semiconductor player like Intel could create negative sentiment across the technology sector, affecting investor perceptions of companies related to it, like Apple. Given Apple's robust market position and ongoing demand for its products, the immediate impact may be mitigated. Despite this, there is a prevailing sense of cautiousness in the market related to the semiconductor industry's challenges, influencing the outlook for Apple slightly negatively. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a stock price fall, reflecting broader concerns in the tech sector stemming from Intel's situation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news headline paints a negative picture of Apple's performance in 2025, stating it's the worst-performing Dow Jones stock. This negative sentiment will likely drive the stock price down. The question posed in the headline, 'Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?' offers a glimmer of hope for a potential rebound, but this is outweighed by the initial negative statement. Considering previous predictions, the overall trend leans toward a higher probability of a stock price fall. I put a higher probability on stock price falling by averaging the stock price falling probabilities of the last round, and lowering the stock price rising probability by the same amount.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on other companies, primarily Nvidia's rise to become the world's most valuable company and the positive impact of a new AI infrastructure project on several tech firms (including Nvidia and Oracle). Apple is only mentioned in passing as having been overtaken by Nvidia.  While Apple's stock experienced a 3% drop previously, the news doesn't offer any direct information indicating a significant change in Apple's future performance. The overall market sentiment seems positive due to AI investment, which *could* indirectly influence Apple positively, but this effect is likely to be weak.  Considering the previous predictions, many models lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall for Apple due to the lack of positive news and the context of Nvidia's outperformance. The previous predictions' average suggests a higher probability of a fall than a rise,  but there's significant uncertainty inherent in predicting stock movement based on this type of news.  Therefore, I will assign a somewhat higher probability to a continued minor downward trend for Apple, though this is not a strong prediction due to lack of direct Apple specific news. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the opening of a new Apple store in Miami, emphasizing Apple's retail expansion, customer experience, and environmental sustainability.

This underperformance suggests current investor pessimism and could trigger further selling. The headline explicitly refers to a potential 'buying opportunity,' which hints at possible optimistic views from some investors. Previous predictions show a strong trend towards a moderate expectation that the stock may continue to fall, given the recent trends and the current pessimistic market sentiment.
