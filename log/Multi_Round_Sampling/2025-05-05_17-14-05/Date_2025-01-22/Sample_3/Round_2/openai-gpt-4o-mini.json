(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market, in collaboration with Google, intensifies competition in a segment where Apple is also a key player with its Vision Pro product. This news suggests a potential threat to Apple's market share and innovation leadership in the AR space, leading to investor caution. While there could also be a positive sentiment if Apple's response to the competition is perceived favorably, overall, the competitive dynamics introduced by Samsung's move are likely to lead to a negative short-term impact on AAPL stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. While competition can spur innovation, it also puts downward pressure on potential market share and pricing for Apple's products. Apple's Vision Pro is also mentioned with limitations. This suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, a stock price fall is slightly more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Buffett's anecdote highlights strong consumer loyalty to iPhones, this is counterbalanced by significant challenges in the Chinese market (a key revenue source).  The 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and the loss of market leadership represent a substantial headwind.  Furthermore,  Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake, though explained by broader investment strategy, could be interpreted negatively by some investors.  The positive sentiment from Buffett's statement about customer loyalty is weakened by the contradictory evidence of declining sales and market share.  Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation.  The overall impact of the news is likely to be neutral or slightly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI, which could potentially intensify competition in the smartphone market. While this may not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the short term, it underscores the competitive pressures in the industry, especially given recent concerns about weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. However, Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors beyond just competitor actions, including its own product innovations, ecosystem strength, and financial performance. Given the news emphasizes Samsung's advancements rather than any direct negative impact on Apple, the immediate effect on AAPL's stock may be muted. Nonetheless, the competitive landscape could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami is generally positive. The store offers the full lineup of Apple products, features an industry-leading environmental store design, and provides personalized support to customers. While the impact of a single store opening on the overall stock price may be limited, the news highlights Apple's continued investment in retail and its commitment to environmental sustainability and community engagement. The store's design and features, such as the use of regionally sourced materials and 100% renewable energy, align with Apple's values and may enhance its brand reputation. However, the stock price movement is more likely to be influenced by broader market trends and the company's financial performance than by a single store opening. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a top cash app stock according to hedge funds, highlighting its strong services segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, and its record revenue in Q4 2024. The article also mentions the company's progress towards becoming carbon-neutral and its innovative products. However, it notes that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Based on this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, as the overall tone of the article is positive and highlights Apple's strengths and growth potential.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, emphasizing the challenges faced by Apple in combating theft and the inadequacy of law enforcement agencies in certain cases. The news focuses more on issues surrounding iPhone theft rather than any direct impact on the company's profits or operational capabilities. There is no significant mention of changes in business strategy or financial results which would directly affect the stock price. However, consumer sentiment might be slightly impacted due to concerns over security and theft, particularly if such incidents become perceived as frequent.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung and Google into the augmented reality glasses market represents increased competition for Apple, particularly as Apple has invested heavily in its Vision Pro product. The news indicates that Samsung, in collaboration with Google, is actively pursuing the AR glasses segment, which could negatively impact Apple's market share and investor sentiment. Additionally, Apple's challenges in generating sufficient content and maintaining competitive pricing for the Vision Pro may compound the negative sentiment. While Apple has a loyal customer base and potential countermeasures, the immediate implications of increased competition and product launches by rivals are likely to weigh on the stock. The prediction leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall given these competitive dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. This news is likely to have a negative impact on the stock. The previous rounds present a mixed sentiment, with others initially leaning slightly bearish. Taking them into account, and considering that the news primarily highlights increased competition, a fall is slightly more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Buffett's anecdote highlights strong customer loyalty, a positive factor. However, this is significantly counterbalanced by the reported 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and the loss of market leadership there. This represents a substantial negative impact, especially given China's importance to Apple's revenue.  Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake, while attributed to broader investment strategy, adds to the negative sentiment. While Buffett's comment on iPhone loyalty is positive, it's not strong enough to outweigh the considerable negative news about declining sales and market share in a key region. The overall impact leans negative, although the strength of customer loyalty suggests the price drop won't be dramatic. Considering previous predictions showing a range of probabilities, I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise, reflecting the weight of negative market data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 line with a strong focus on AI features, which could intensify competition in the smartphone market.

The news does not present any immediate negative outcomes for Apple, but the competitive landscape could weigh on investor sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, which leaned slightly towards a negative impact, and the competitive nature of the news, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price fall with a lower probability of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami is generally positive.

This highlights Apple's continued investment in retail and its commitment to environmental sustainability and community engagement. While the impact of a single store opening on the overall stock price may be limited, the news may enhance Apple's brand reputation and contribute to a positive sentiment. Considering the positive tone and details of the news, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a top cash app stock according to hedge funds, highlighting its strong services segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, and its record revenue in Q4 2024. The overall tone of the article is positive, focusing on Apple's strengths and growth potential. Although some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise, the emphasis on Apple's achievements and its continued innovation suggests a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there seems to be a trend towards a more positive sentiment over time, with the most recent predictions indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. Therefore, based on the positive news and the trend in previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, emphasizing the challenges faced by Apple in combating theft and the inadequacy of law enforcement agencies in certain cases.
