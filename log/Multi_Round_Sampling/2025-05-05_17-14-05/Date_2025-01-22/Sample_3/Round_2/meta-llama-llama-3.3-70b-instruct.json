(AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung into the AR glasses market, in collaboration with Google, intensifies competition in a segment where Apple is also a key player with its Vision Pro product. This news suggests a potential threat to Apple's market share and innovation leadership in the AR space, leading to investor caution. While there could also be a positive sentiment if Apple's response to the competition is perceived favorably, overall, the competitive dynamics introduced by Samsung's move are likely to lead to a negative short-term impact on AAPL stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. While competition can spur innovation, it also puts downward pressure on potential market share and pricing for Apple's products. Apple's Vision Pro is also mentioned with limitations. This suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, a stock price fall is slightly more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Buffett's anecdote highlights strong consumer loyalty to iPhones, this is counterbalanced by significant challenges in the Chinese market (a key revenue source).  The 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and the loss of market leadership represent a substantial headwind.  Furthermore,  Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake, though explained by broader investment strategy, could be interpreted negatively by some investors.  The positive sentiment from Buffett's statement about customer loyalty is weakened by the contradictory evidence of declining sales and market share.  Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall or stagnation.  The overall impact of the news is likely to be neutral or slightly negative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI, which could potentially intensify competition in the smartphone market. While this may not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the short term, it underscores the competitive pressures in the industry, especially given recent concerns about weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. However, Apple's stock price is influenced by a wide range of factors beyond just competitor actions, including its own product innovations, ecosystem strength, and financial performance. Given the news emphasizes Samsung's advancements rather than any direct negative impact on Apple, the immediate effect on AAPL's stock may be muted. Nonetheless, the competitive landscape could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami is generally positive. The store offers the full lineup of Apple products, features an industry-leading environmental store design, and provides personalized support to customers. While the impact of a single store opening on the overall stock price may be limited, the news highlights Apple's continued investment in retail and its commitment to environmental sustainability and community engagement. The store's design and features, such as the use of regionally sourced materials and 100% renewable energy, align with Apple's values and may enhance its brand reputation. However, the stock price movement is more likely to be influenced by broader market trends and the company's financial performance than by a single store opening. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a top cash app stock according to hedge funds, highlighting its strong services segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, and its record revenue in Q4 2024. The article also mentions the company's progress towards becoming carbon-neutral and its innovative products. However, it notes that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Based on this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, as the overall tone of the article is positive and highlights Apple's strengths and growth potential.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, emphasizing the challenges faced by Apple in combating theft and the inadequacy of law enforcement agencies in certain cases. The news focuses more on issues surrounding iPhone theft rather than any direct impact on the company's profits or operational capabilities. There is no significant mention of changes in business strategy or financial results which would directly affect the stock price. However, consumer sentiment might be slightly impacted due to concerns over security and theft, particularly if such incidents become perceived as frequent.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The entry of Samsung and Google into the augmented reality glasses market represents increased competition for Apple, particularly as Apple has invested heavily in its Vision Pro product. The news indicates that Samsung, in collaboration with Google, is actively pursuing the AR glasses segment, which could negatively impact Apple's market share and investor sentiment. Additionally, Apple's challenges in generating sufficient content and maintaining competitive pricing for the Vision Pro may compound the negative sentiment. While Apple has a loyal customer base and potential countermeasures, the immediate implications of increased competition and product launches by rivals are likely to weigh on the stock. The prediction leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall given these competitive dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. This news is likely to have a negative impact on the stock. The previous rounds present a mixed sentiment, with others initially leaning slightly bearish. Taking them into account, and considering that the news primarily highlights increased competition, a fall is slightly more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Buffett's anecdote highlights strong customer loyalty, a positive factor. However, this is significantly counterbalanced by the reported 17% drop in iPhone sales in China and the loss of market leadership there. This represents a substantial negative impact, especially given China's importance to Apple's revenue.  Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake, while attributed to broader investment strategy, adds to the negative sentiment. While Buffett's comment on iPhone loyalty is positive, it's not strong enough to outweigh the considerable negative news about declining sales and market share in a key region. The overall impact leans negative, although the strength of customer loyalty suggests the price drop won't be dramatic. Considering previous predictions showing a range of probabilities, I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a fall than a rise, reflecting the weight of negative market data.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's launch of the Galaxy S25 line with a strong focus on AI features, which could intensify competition in the smartphone market. While this does not directly indicate a negative impact on Apple's sales or market share, it underscores the competitive pressures in the industry, especially given recent concerns about weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. The news does not present any immediate negative outcomes for Apple, but the competitive landscape could weigh on investor sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, which leaned slightly towards a negative impact, and the competitive nature of the news, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price fall with a lower probability of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami is generally positive.

This highlights Apple's continued investment in retail and its commitment to environmental sustainability and community engagement. While the impact of a single store opening on the overall stock price may be limited, the news may enhance Apple's brand reputation and contribute to a positive sentiment. Considering the positive tone and details of the news, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a top cash app stock according to hedge funds, highlighting its strong services segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, and its record revenue in Q4 2024. The overall tone of the article is positive, focusing on Apple's strengths and growth potential. Although some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise, the emphasis on Apple's achievements and its continued innovation suggests a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there seems to be a trend towards a more positive sentiment over time, with the most recent predictions indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. Therefore, based on the positive news and the trend in previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a case where an iPhone was stolen and tracked across multiple locations, emphasizing the challenges faced by Apple in combating theft and the inadequacy of law enforcement agencies in certain cases.
