(AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, which could have a negative effect on sentiment. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing growth, which could positively influence the stock. However, the stagnation in analyst EPS revisions suggests a lack of momentum going into earnings, alongside a relatively high valuation compared to industry peers. This mixed outlook leads to an estimation of a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the earnings potential but tempered by recent underperformance and analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching a new ultrathin phone (Galaxy S25 Edge) ahead of Apple, potentially capturing market share in this emerging category. While Apple is also developing a similar phone, Samsung's first mover advantage could negatively impact Apple's stock. The article suggests this new category is important for Apple, as the ultrathin phone is replacing the less successful Plus model. Therefore, this poses a threat. The name 'iPhone Air' is speculative, it is more credible that Apple will name it differently to give it a unique identity. The lack of any further information from third party analysts on the actual likely impact of this news makes precise estimations impossible. The analysis takes the view that with Apple already down in price, there is the likely impact of the news being already priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, before Apple's anticipated release of a similar iPhone.  While this could be seen as negative for Apple in the short term (potential loss of market share in a niche segment),  several factors mitigate the impact. Firstly, the success of ultrathin phones is not guaranteed; Apple's previous attempts at introducing niche iPhone sizes (mini and Plus) failed. Secondly, Samsung's phone is positioned at a lower price point than its high-end Ultra model, suggesting it may target a different market segment.  Thirdly, the article highlights that Apple's ultrathin iPhone is one of its boldest design changes in years, indicating potential long-term benefits for Apple if successful.  Therefore, the news does not represent a significant threat to Apple's overall market position or profitability. The probability of a stock price drop is relatively low because the overall impact is likely to be small and short-lived. The market may already have discounted this possibility, given Apple's strong brand loyalty and history of innovation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. Overall, the positive aspects of Apple's performance and hedge fund interest outweigh the negative implications of Cash App's issues. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund holders. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, contributes to its growth. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September quarter, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive news about Apple's financial performance and its strong position in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a significant competitor in the tech sector, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in a promising technological sector that Apple has also been developing for some time, though keeping the public details vague. This competition might lead Apple to face challenges in capturing a larger share of the potential AR market. However, since Apple's Vision Pro has been struggling with app and content availability, increased competition could push Apple to enhance its ecosystem, potentially offsetting these risks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Apple's stock performance has been mixed, with a slight gain on the last trading day but a notable decline over the past month, which may dampen investor sentiment ahead of the upcoming earnings report. The estimates indicate an expected increase in EPS and revenue, suggesting potential for positive movement, but stagnant analyst revisions and a relatively high P/E ratio compared to the industry could limit gains. The spotlight on analyst sentiment, the upcoming earnings report, and competition from Samsung's new product create a complex picture, necessitating a balanced approach to estimating price movement probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin Galaxy S25 Edge before Apple's anticipated ultrathin iPhone. This first-mover advantage for Samsung in a potentially trendy category could negatively impact Apple's stock. However, Apple is also expected to release its own version soon. Considering the previous round's predictions, there appears to be some conflicting information about the stock, suggesting a more uncertain future. Furthermore, some view competition as good for Apple in this regard. Given Samsung's potential gain and mixed opinions, I predict the stock price falling is slightly more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Samsung beating Apple to market with an ultrathin phone is potentially negative for Apple in the short term.  However, the impact is likely to be muted for several reasons.  First, the success of this niche market segment is not guaranteed; Apple's past experience with mini and Plus iPhones suggests consumer demand for radically different form factors may be limited. Second, Samsung's lower price point suggests it is targeting a different market segment. Third, Apple's response is described as one of its boldest design changes in years, implying potential long-term benefits if successful.  Finally, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, with several models predicting a stock rise, and they seem to be factoring in other, potentially positive, factors not directly related to the ultrathin phone news.  Considering these factors, the potential negative impact of Samsung's announcement on Apple is likely to be relatively small and short-lived.  The market may have already priced in this risk given Apple's history and brand loyalty.  The diverse range of prior predictions further supports a more neutral stance, hence a probability closer to 0.5 for both rise and fall, slightly leaning towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment concerning Apple in several previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise. Considering the mixed but generally positive outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations. Considering the overall positive sentiment from this news and outweighing it with previous predictions that indicate a mixed but generally positive outlook, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund holders. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, contributes to its growth. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September quarter, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. Additionally, the company's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive news about Apple's financial performance and its strong position in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong financials and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to increased competition from Samsung and regulatory issues with Cash App. Taking into account the mixed opinions and the overall positive news, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.4.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in collaboration with Google, putting them in direct competition with Apple, which is also actively developing similar technology. This news could create competitive pressure on Apple, as Samsung's first-mover advantage and established presence in the market might attract potential buyers, thereby impacting Apple's market share. However, Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector with a robust ecosystem and brand loyalty that can mitigate some of the competitive effects. Despite this potential negative impact, the overall reaction seems less severe considering historical precedents where competition hasn't always led to significant short-term declines in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent performance shows a slight daily gain but a significant decline over the past month, trailing behind key market indices. The upcoming earnings report is critical, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue, which introduces potential for positive stock movement. However, stagnant analyst revisions indicate a lack of momentum. Compounding this is competitive pressure from Samsung's new ultrathin phone, which could affect Apple's market position. Despite these challenges, the overall sentiment around Apple remains relatively positive due to strong brand loyalty, innovation, and a significant position in the services market. Taking into account the balanced perspectives from previous predictions, a slightly elevated probability of stock price rise is warranted due to potential earnings and a mostly favorable long-term outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin phone ahead of Apple, potentially giving Samsung a first-mover advantage in this niche market. While Apple is also developing a similar phone, this competition could negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term. However, the overall success of ultrathin phones is not guaranteed, as indicated by Apple's previous failed attempts with niche iPhone sizes. Furthermore, previous rounds show mixed opinions, with some models predicting a rise in Apple's stock due to other positive factors, highlighting the complexity of the situation. Considering Samsung's potential gain in the ultrathin market and the mixed opinions from previous analyses, I estimate a slightly higher probability that Apple's stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Samsung's ultrathin phone release before Apple's is a negative factor, potentially impacting Apple's market share in this specific niche. However, the severity of this impact is debatable.  Previous predictions are mixed, showing no clear consensus.  Some models point to the potential for this news to be already discounted in the stock price, given Apple's brand strength and the uncertain success of ultrathin phones.  Others highlight Apple's planned ultrathin iPhone as a bold design change with potential long-term benefits.  The lower price point of Samsung's phone suggests it targets a different market segment.  Furthermore, other positive news regarding Apple's financials and resolving disputes contributes to a more nuanced outlook, preventing an overwhelmingly negative assessment. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for this news to have a limited, short-term impact, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems plausible. The probability of a stock price fall is weighted slightly higher due to the immediate competitive pressure. This differs from models that focus on long-term innovation and other positive factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise. Considering the mixed but generally positive outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong financials and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to increased competition from Samsung and regulatory issues with Cash App. Taking into account the mixed opinions and the overall positive news, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.4.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations. Considering the overall positive sentiment from this news and weighing it with previous predictions that indicate a mixed but generally positive outlook, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise.
