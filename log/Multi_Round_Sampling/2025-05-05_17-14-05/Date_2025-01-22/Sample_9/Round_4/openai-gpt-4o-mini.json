(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, which could have a negative effect on sentiment. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing growth, which could positively influence the stock. However, the stagnation in analyst EPS revisions suggests a lack of momentum going into earnings, alongside a relatively high valuation compared to industry peers. This mixed outlook leads to an estimation of a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the earnings potential but tempered by recent underperformance and analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching a new ultrathin phone (Galaxy S25 Edge) ahead of Apple, potentially capturing market share in this emerging category. While Apple is also developing a similar phone, Samsung's first mover advantage could negatively impact Apple's stock. The article suggests this new category is important for Apple, as the ultrathin phone is replacing the less successful Plus model. Therefore, this poses a threat. The name 'iPhone Air' is speculative, it is more credible that Apple will name it differently to give it a unique identity. The lack of any further information from third party analysts on the actual likely impact of this news makes precise estimations impossible. The analysis takes the view that with Apple already down in price, there is the likely impact of the news being already priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, before Apple's anticipated release of a similar iPhone.  While this could be seen as negative for Apple in the short term (potential loss of market share in a niche segment),  several factors mitigate the impact. Firstly, the success of ultrathin phones is not guaranteed; Apple's previous attempts at introducing niche iPhone sizes (mini and Plus) failed. Secondly, Samsung's phone is positioned at a lower price point than its high-end Ultra model, suggesting it may target a different market segment.  Thirdly, the article highlights that Apple's ultrathin iPhone is one of its boldest design changes in years, indicating potential long-term benefits for Apple if successful.  Therefore, the news does not represent a significant threat to Apple's overall market position or profitability. The probability of a stock price drop is relatively low because the overall impact is likely to be small and short-lived. The market may already have discounted this possibility, given Apple's strong brand loyalty and history of innovation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. Overall, the positive aspects of Apple's performance and hedge fund interest outweigh the negative implications of Cash App's issues. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund holders. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, contributes to its growth. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September quarter, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive news about Apple's financial performance and its strong position in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a significant competitor in the tech sector, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in a promising technological sector that Apple has also been developing for some time, though keeping the public details vague. This competition might lead Apple to face challenges in capturing a larger share of the potential AR market. However, since Apple's Vision Pro has been struggling with app and content availability, increased competition could push Apple to enhance its ecosystem, potentially offsetting these risks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: Apple's stock performance has been mixed, with a slight gain on the last trading day but a notable decline over the past month, which may dampen investor sentiment ahead of the upcoming earnings report. The estimates indicate an expected increase in EPS and revenue, suggesting potential for positive movement, but stagnant analyst revisions and a relatively high P/E ratio compared to the industry could limit gains. The spotlight on analyst sentiment, the upcoming earnings report, and competition from Samsung's new product create a complex picture, necessitating a balanced approach to estimating price movement probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin Galaxy S25 Edge before Apple's anticipated ultrathin iPhone. This first-mover advantage for Samsung in a potentially trendy category could negatively impact Apple's stock. However, Apple is also expected to release its own version soon. Considering the previous round's predictions, there appears to be some conflicting information about the stock, suggesting a more uncertain future. Furthermore, some view competition as good for Apple in this regard. Given Samsung's potential gain and mixed opinions, I predict the stock price falling is slightly more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Samsung beating Apple to market with an ultrathin phone is potentially negative for Apple in the short term.  However, the impact is likely to be muted for several reasons.  First, the success of this niche market segment is not guaranteed; Apple's past experience with mini and Plus iPhones suggests consumer demand for radically different form factors may be limited. Second, Samsung's lower price point suggests it is targeting a different market segment. Third, Apple's response is described as one of its boldest design changes in years, implying potential long-term benefits if successful.  Finally, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, with several models predicting a stock rise, and they seem to be factoring in other, potentially positive, factors not directly related to the ultrathin phone news.  Considering these factors, the potential negative impact of Samsung's announcement on Apple is likely to be relatively small and short-lived.  The market may have already priced in this risk given Apple's history and brand loyalty.  The diverse range of prior predictions further supports a more neutral stance, hence a probability closer to 0.5 for both rise and fall, slightly leaning towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment concerning Apple in several previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise. Considering the mixed but generally positive outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations. Considering the overall positive sentiment from this news and outweighing it with previous predictions that indicate a mixed but generally positive outlook, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund holders. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, contributes to its growth. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September quarter, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. Additionally, the company's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive news about Apple's financial performance and its strong position in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong financials and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to increased competition from Samsung and regulatory issues with Cash App. Taking into account the mixed opinions and the overall positive news, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.4.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality glasses market in collaboration with Google, putting them in direct competition with Apple, which is also actively developing similar technology. This news could create competitive pressure on Apple, as Samsung's first-mover advantage and established presence in the market might attract potential buyers, thereby impacting Apple's market share. However, Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector with a robust ecosystem and brand loyalty that can mitigate some of the competitive effects. Despite this potential negative impact, the overall reaction seems less severe considering historical precedents where competition hasn't always led to significant short-term declines in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's recent performance shows a slight daily gain but a significant decline over the past month, trailing behind key market indices. The upcoming earnings report is critical, with expectations for growth in EPS and revenue, which introduces potential for positive stock movement. However, stagnant analyst revisions indicate a lack of momentum. Compounding this is competitive pressure from Samsung's new ultrathin phone, which could affect Apple's market position. Despite these challenges, the overall sentiment around Apple remains relatively positive due to strong brand loyalty, innovation, and a significant position in the services market. Taking into account the balanced perspectives from previous predictions, a slightly elevated probability of stock price rise is warranted due to potential earnings and a mostly favorable long-term outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's plan to launch an ultrathin phone ahead of Apple, potentially giving Samsung a first-mover advantage in this niche market. While Apple is also developing a similar phone, this competition could negatively impact Apple's stock price in the short term. However, the overall success of ultrathin phones is not guaranteed, as indicated by Apple's previous failed attempts with niche iPhone sizes. Furthermore, previous rounds show mixed opinions, with some models predicting a rise in Apple's stock due to other positive factors, highlighting the complexity of the situation. Considering Samsung's potential gain in the ultrathin market and the mixed opinions from previous analyses, I estimate a slightly higher probability that Apple's stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Samsung's ultrathin phone release before Apple's is a negative factor, potentially impacting Apple's market share in this specific niche. However, the severity of this impact is debatable.  Previous predictions are mixed, showing no clear consensus.  Some models point to the potential for this news to be already discounted in the stock price, given Apple's brand strength and the uncertain success of ultrathin phones.  Others highlight Apple's planned ultrathin iPhone as a bold design change with potential long-term benefits.  The lower price point of Samsung's phone suggests it targets a different market segment.  Furthermore, other positive news regarding Apple's financials and resolving disputes contributes to a more nuanced outlook, preventing an overwhelmingly negative assessment. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for this news to have a limited, short-term impact, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems plausible. The probability of a stock price fall is weighted slightly higher due to the immediate competitive pressure. This differs from models that focus on long-term innovation and other positive factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise. Considering the mixed but generally positive outlook, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than it falling. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong financials and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to increased competition from Samsung and regulatory issues with Cash App. Taking into account the mixed opinions and the overall positive news, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.6 and the probability of the stock price falling to be around 0.4.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations. Considering the overall positive sentiment from this news and weighing it with previous predictions that indicate a mixed but generally positive outlook, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise. Considering the mixed but generally positive outlook and taking into account the previous predictions from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's entry into the augmented reality glasses market in collaboration with Google, putting them in direct competition with Apple, which is also actively developing similar technology. This news could create competitive pressure on Apple, as Samsung's first-mover advantage and established presence in the market might attract potential buyers, thereby impacting Apple's market share. However, Apple remains a strong player in the technology sector with a robust ecosystem and brand loyalty that can mitigate some of the competitive effects. Despite this potential negative impact, historical precedents suggest that competition from Samsung might not necessarily lead to significant short-term declines in Apple's stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis of the news reveals a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although the company is showing slight daily gains, it has underperformed relative to key market indices and lost significant value over the previous month. The upcoming earnings report is pivotal, with positive projections for EPS and revenue, suggesting potential for a price increase. However, stagnant analyst estimate revisions indicate low momentum, and competition from Samsung's new ultrathin phone could exert downward pressure on Apple's stock. Recent predictions from various models show a range of probabilities leaning slightly towards a rise, balanced by concerns over competitive pressures and market sentiment. Overall, while challenges exist, Apple's strong brand loyalty and innovation position support a moderate probability of stock price rise amidst uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news of Samsung launching an ultrathin phone before Apple presents a competitive challenge, potentially impacting Apple's market share in this emerging category. While Apple is expected to follow suit, being first to market gives Samsung an advantage. Previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a stock rise due to Apple's strong financials and brand. However, recent trends show a slight downward pressure on the predicted rise, indicating some concern. Considering Samsung's first-mover advantage and the uncertainty of the ultrathin phone market's success, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling. Models that predict a rise might be influenced by factors external to this specific news, like overall investor optimism or expectations of a good earnings report, which I'm giving less weight to in this specific prediction focused on the Samsung news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Samsung beating Apple to market with an ultrathin phone is a short-term negative, but its impact is likely muted.  The success of this niche market segment is uncertain, given Apple's past struggles with similar product variations. Samsung's lower price point also suggests it targets a different market segment.  However, the fact Apple's response is described as a bold design change, implies potential longer-term benefits.  The previous predictions show considerable divergence, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  Some models emphasize Apple's inherent strengths (brand, services revenue, etc.), while others focus on the competitive threat. The overall market sentiment on AAPL is presently mixed.  Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is weighted slightly higher due to the immediate competitive pressure, though other positive factors concerning Apple are counterbalancing this. The probabilities are not strongly inclined towards either event, reflecting the uncertainty and the mixture of positive and negative aspects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted, which could positively influence investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. The overall sentiment from hedge funds is positive, with 158 hedge fund holders, but there is a mention that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise. Considering the mixed but generally positive outlook and taking into account the previous predictions from other models, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.
