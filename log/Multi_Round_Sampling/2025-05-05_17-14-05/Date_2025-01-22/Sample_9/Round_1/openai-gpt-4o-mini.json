(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, which could have a negative effect on sentiment. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing growth, which could positively influence the stock. However, the stagnation in analyst EPS revisions suggests a lack of momentum going into earnings, alongside a relatively high valuation compared to industry peers. This mixed outlook leads to an estimation of a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the earnings potential but tempered by recent underperformance and analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching a new ultrathin phone (Galaxy S25 Edge) ahead of Apple, potentially capturing market share in this emerging category. While Apple is also developing a similar phone, Samsung's first mover advantage could negatively impact Apple's stock. The article suggests this new category is important for Apple, as the ultrathin phone is replacing the less successful Plus model. Therefore, this poses a threat. The name 'iPhone Air' is speculative, it is more credible that Apple will name it differently to give it a unique identity. The lack of any further information from third party analysts on the actual likely impact of this news makes precise estimations impossible. The analysis takes the view that with Apple already down in price, there is the likely impact of the news being already priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, before Apple's anticipated release of a similar iPhone.  While this could be seen as negative for Apple in the short term (potential loss of market share in a niche segment),  several factors mitigate the impact. Firstly, the success of ultrathin phones is not guaranteed; Apple's previous attempts at introducing niche iPhone sizes (mini and Plus) failed. Secondly, Samsung's phone is positioned at a lower price point than its high-end Ultra model, suggesting it may target a different market segment.  Thirdly, the article highlights that Apple's ultrathin iPhone is one of its boldest design changes in years, indicating potential long-term benefits for Apple if successful.  Therefore, the news does not represent a significant threat to Apple's overall market position or profitability. The probability of a stock price drop is relatively low because the overall impact is likely to be small and short-lived. The market may already have discounted this possibility, given Apple's strong brand loyalty and history of innovation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. Overall, the positive aspects of Apple's performance and hedge fund interest outweigh the negative implications of Cash App's issues. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund holders. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, contributes to its growth. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September quarter, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive news about Apple's financial performance and its strong position in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a significant competitor in the tech sector, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in a promising technological sector that Apple has also been developing for some time, though keeping the public details vague. This competition might lead Apple to face challenges in capturing a larger share of the potential AR market. However, since Apple's Vision Pro has been struggling with app and content availability, increased competition could push Apple to enhance its ecosystem, potentially offsetting these risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
