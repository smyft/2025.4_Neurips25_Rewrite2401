(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has experienced a slight daily gain of 0.53%, but it has underperformed relative to market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past month, which could have a negative effect on sentiment. The upcoming earnings report is crucial, with projected EPS and revenue showing growth, which could positively influence the stock. However, the stagnation in analyst EPS revisions suggests a lack of momentum going into earnings, alongside a relatively high valuation compared to industry peers. This mixed outlook leads to an estimation of a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the earnings potential but tempered by recent underperformance and analyst sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching a new ultrathin phone (Galaxy S25 Edge) ahead of Apple, potentially capturing market share in this emerging category. While Apple is also developing a similar phone, Samsung's first mover advantage could negatively impact Apple's stock. The article suggests this new category is important for Apple, as the ultrathin phone is replacing the less successful Plus model. Therefore, this poses a threat. The name 'iPhone Air' is speculative, it is more credible that Apple will name it differently to give it a unique identity. The lack of any further information from third party analysts on the actual likely impact of this news makes precise estimations impossible. The analysis takes the view that with Apple already down in price, there is the likely impact of the news being already priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news reports that Samsung is launching an ultrathin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge, before Apple's anticipated release of a similar iPhone.  While this could be seen as negative for Apple in the short term (potential loss of market share in a niche segment),  several factors mitigate the impact. Firstly, the success of ultrathin phones is not guaranteed; Apple's previous attempts at introducing niche iPhone sizes (mini and Plus) failed. Secondly, Samsung's phone is positioned at a lower price point than its high-end Ultra model, suggesting it may target a different market segment.  Thirdly, the article highlights that Apple's ultrathin iPhone is one of its boldest design changes in years, indicating potential long-term benefits for Apple if successful.  Therefore, the news does not represent a significant threat to Apple's overall market position or profitability. The probability of a stock price drop is relatively low because the overall impact is likely to be small and short-lived. The market may already have discounted this possibility, given Apple's strong brand loyalty and history of innovation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong position in the cash app market, its robust Services segment, and record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Additionally, Apple's focus on innovation and sustainability is noted. However, the article also mentions challenges faced by Cash App, including regulatory fines and fraud allegations, which could indirectly affect Apple's association with Cash App. Overall, the positive aspects of Apple's performance and hedge fund interest outweigh the negative implications of Cash App's issues. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia over local investment rules, which had blocked iPhone 16 sales. The company has offered a $1 billion investment plan, which includes an AirTag factory, and officials expect a resolution within one to two weeks. This positive development is likely to have a favorable impact on Apple's stock price as it removes a significant market barrier and shows Apple's commitment to investment and compliance with local regulations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s position as a strong cash app stock according to hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund holders. The company's strong Services business segment, including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, contributes to its growth. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September quarter, driven by strong iPhone revenue and a double-digit increase in services revenue. However, the article also mentions that some hedge funds believe other AI stocks may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering the overall positive news about Apple's financial performance and its strong position in the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Samsung, a significant competitor in the tech sector, is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market with a partnership with Google. This could increase competition for Apple in a promising technological sector that Apple has also been developing for some time, though keeping the public details vague. This competition might lead Apple to face challenges in capturing a larger share of the potential AR market. However, since Apple's Vision Pro has been struggling with app and content availability, increased competition could push Apple to enhance its ecosystem, potentially offsetting these risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
