(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung to Beat Apple to Ultrathin Phone With Galaxy S25 Edge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin smartphone, potentially capturing market interest before Apple releases its own similar product. This could lead to increased competition in the smartphone market segment, particularly for premium devices. Since Apple and Samsung are primary competitors, the news may concern investors about Apple's ability to maintain its market share and impact on sales, which could exert downward pressure on AAPL's stock price. However, Apple historically performs well in the long run and may still see a positive response depending on consumer reception of its upcoming products. Therefore, the stock might be more likely to fall in the short term with significant uncertainty about the competitive landscape ahead.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. While competition can spur innovation, it also puts downward pressure on potential market share and pricing for Apple's products. Apple's Vision Pro is also mentioned with limitations. This suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, a stock price fall is slightly more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\" is inherently neutral and provides no specific information about Apple's performance or upcoming events that would significantly affect its stock price.  The question posed is speculative and doesn't offer any insights into positive or negative factors influencing the stock. Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is essentially based on the overall market conditions and Apple's existing fundamental and technical factors, which are not addressed in this headline.  Without additional information, we assume a roughly equal probability for price increase or decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to the market. This could be perceived as a competitive threat to Apple, as it may lose some market share in the ultrathin smartphone segment to Samsung. However, Apple is also expected to release its own ultrathin iPhone later in the year, which could mitigate some of the negative impact. The market's reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment regarding Apple's ability to compete in this new category. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a negative reaction due to the immediate competitive threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price ended at $223.83, with a 0.53% increase, but this gain lagged behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Over the previous month, Apple's shares have witnessed a loss of 13.77%, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500. The company is scheduled to release its earnings report on January 30, 2025, with projected EPS of $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year, and revenue of $124.1 billion, up 3.78% from the equivalent quarter last year. Apple's current Zacks Rank is #3 (Hold), and there have been no recent changes in EPS projections. The stock's Forward P/E ratio is 29.97, indicating a premium compared to its industry average. Based on these mixed signals, with both positive earnings projections and a premium valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling but still uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's stock price has been lagging behind the market, with a 13.77% loss over the previous month. However, the projected earnings per share (EPS) and revenue for the forthcoming earnings report show positive growth. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) and the premium valuation metrics, such as the Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and the PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's emphasis on AI enhancements in its latest Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup. This focus on AI and related features aims to attract users who might consider upgrading their devices. However, since Apple primarily relies on hardware sales and software ecosystem rather than AI-specific features, the direct impact on Apple's stock price might not be immediate but could affect investor sentiment negatively if it leads to speculation about a potential shift towards AI-centric competition. Nonetheless, Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product portfolio might mitigate adverse effects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
