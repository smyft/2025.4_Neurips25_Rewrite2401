(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung Set to Enter AR Glasses Market in Race With Meta, Apple\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin smartphone, potentially capturing market interest before Apple releases its own similar product. This could lead to increased competition in the smartphone market segment, particularly for premium devices. Since Apple and Samsung are primary competitors, the news may concern investors about Apple's ability to maintain its market share and impact on sales, which could exert downward pressure on AAPL's stock price. However, Apple historically performs well in the long run and may still see a positive response depending on consumer reception of its upcoming products. Therefore, the stock might be more likely to fall in the short term with significant uncertainty about the competitive landscape ahead.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. While competition can spur innovation, it also puts downward pressure on potential market share and pricing for Apple's products. Apple's Vision Pro is also mentioned with limitations. This suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, a stock price fall is slightly more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\" is inherently neutral and provides no specific information about Apple's performance or upcoming events that would significantly affect its stock price.  The question posed is speculative and doesn't offer any insights into positive or negative factors influencing the stock. Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is essentially based on the overall market conditions and Apple's existing fundamental and technical factors, which are not addressed in this headline.  Without additional information, we assume a roughly equal probability for price increase or decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to the market. This could be perceived as a competitive threat to Apple, as it may lose some market share in the ultrathin smartphone segment to Samsung. However, Apple is also expected to release its own ultrathin iPhone later in the year, which could mitigate some of the negative impact. The market's reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment regarding Apple's ability to compete in this new category. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a negative reaction due to the immediate competitive threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price ended at $223.83, with a 0.53% increase, but this gain lagged behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Over the previous month, Apple's shares have witnessed a loss of 13.77%, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500. The company is scheduled to release its earnings report on January 30, 2025, with projected EPS of $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year, and revenue of $124.1 billion, up 3.78% from the equivalent quarter last year. Apple's current Zacks Rank is #3 (Hold), and there have been no recent changes in EPS projections. The stock's Forward P/E ratio is 29.97, indicating a premium compared to its industry average. Based on these mixed signals, with both positive earnings projections and a premium valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling but still uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's stock price has been lagging behind the market, with a 13.77% loss over the previous month. However, the projected earnings per share (EPS) and revenue for the forthcoming earnings report show positive growth. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) and the premium valuation metrics, such as the Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and the PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's emphasis on AI enhancements in its latest Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup. This focus on AI and related features aims to attract users who might consider upgrading their devices. However, since Apple primarily relies on hardware sales and software ecosystem rather than AI-specific features, the direct impact on Apple's stock price might not be immediate but could affect investor sentiment negatively if it leads to speculation about a potential shift towards AI-centric competition. Nonetheless, Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product portfolio might mitigate adverse effects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news of Samsung launching an ultrathin phone ahead of Apple introduces increased competition, which may negatively affect Apple's market share and investor sentiment. While Apple plans to counter with its own ultrathin model later in the year, the immediate threat from Samsung could lead to a downturn in stock price, especially given the history of Apple's pricing strategy and the mixed reaction to its products in recent times. Previous predictions indicate a range of sentiments leaning towards negativity due to competitive pressures, resulting in a higher probability of stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market with Samsung and Google partnering. While the AR market is still nascent, this intensifies the competitive landscape. Previous rounds show varying predictions, with a slight leaning towards a negative impact on Apple stock, although some models acknowledge Apple's strengths and potential for positive growth. Considering the increased competitive pressure and mixed sentiments from previous rounds, I maintain a slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline is vague and doesn't offer actionable information.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty. Several models highlight increased competition from Samsung in various product segments (ultra-thin phones, AR glasses) as a potential negative factor.  Others point to Apple's strong brand, upcoming earnings (projected positive growth), and historical performance, suggesting a possible upward trend. The lack of concrete news in the headline renders the news itself neutral, making the prior predictions more important.  The consensus leans slightly toward a price fall, although with significant uncertainty, so I'll weight that slightly more heavily than a purely neutral prediction.  The variation in predictions across different models suggests that other, non-public information might be influencing some of these predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially capturing market interest before Apple releases its own similar product.

However, Apple historically performs well in the long run and may still see a positive response depending on consumer reception of its upcoming products. Therefore, the stock might be more likely to fall in the short term with significant uncertainty about the competitive landscape ahead. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a slight negative impact, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 0.53% increase to $223.83, which lagged behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Over the previous month, Apple's shares have declined by 13.77%, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500. The article highlights that Apple's earnings report is scheduled for January 30, 2025, with projected EPS of $2.36 (an 8.26% increase) and revenue of $124.1 billion (a 3.78% rise). The current Zacks Rank for Apple is #3 (Hold), and there have been no recent changes in EPS projections. Apple's valuation metrics, such as a Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and a PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a premium compared to its industry averages.

The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) and the premium valuation metrics, such as the Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and the PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering the mixed signals from the news, including both positive earnings projections and a premium valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling. Additionally, other models' predictions indicate a range of probabilities, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to increased competition, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong market position and brand loyalty. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's emphasis on AI enhancements in its latest Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup. This focus on AI and related features aims to attract users who might consider upgrading their devices. Given Apple primarily focuses on hardware innovations and an integrated software ecosystem, the immediate competitive threat may not be significant. Moreover, Apple has a strong market position, resilient brand loyalty, and a diverse product portfolio which can help mitigate any adverse impact of increased competition from Samsung. The news does not provide substantial information regarding the financial health or strategic initiatives of Apple beyond this event, leaving room for mixed investor sentiments. Overall, the probability of the stock price falling is somewhat influenced by competitive pressures, but the strengths of Apple's market position suggest a relatively balanced outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
