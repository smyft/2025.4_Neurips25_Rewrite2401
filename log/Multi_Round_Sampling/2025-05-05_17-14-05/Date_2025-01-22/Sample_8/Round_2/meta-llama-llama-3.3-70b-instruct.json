(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple (AAPL) Ascends But Remains Behind Market: Some Facts to Note\nNews Content: The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung will launch an ultrathin smartphone, potentially capturing market interest before Apple releases its own similar product. This could lead to increased competition in the smartphone market segment, particularly for premium devices. Since Apple and Samsung are primary competitors, the news may concern investors about Apple's ability to maintain its market share and impact on sales, which could exert downward pressure on AAPL's stock price. However, Apple historically performs well in the long run and may still see a positive response depending on consumer reception of its upcoming products. Therefore, the stock might be more likely to fall in the short term with significant uncertainty about the competitive landscape ahead.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market, with Samsung and Google partnering to launch a competing product. While competition can spur innovation, it also puts downward pressure on potential market share and pricing for Apple's products. Apple's Vision Pro is also mentioned with limitations. This suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock. Therefore, a stock price fall is slightly more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Jan. 30?\" is inherently neutral and provides no specific information about Apple's performance or upcoming events that would significantly affect its stock price.  The question posed is speculative and doesn't offer any insights into positive or negative factors influencing the stock. Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is essentially based on the overall market conditions and Apple's existing fundamental and technical factors, which are not addressed in this headline.  Without additional information, we assume a roughly equal probability for price increase or decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Samsung is planning to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, beating Apple to the market. This could be perceived as a competitive threat to Apple, as it may lose some market share in the ultrathin smartphone segment to Samsung. However, Apple is also expected to release its own ultrathin iPhone later in the year, which could mitigate some of the negative impact. The market's reaction will likely depend on investor sentiment regarding Apple's ability to compete in this new category. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a negative reaction due to the immediate competitive threat.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple's stock price ended at $223.83, with a 0.53% increase, but this gain lagged behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Over the previous month, Apple's shares have witnessed a loss of 13.77%, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500. The company is scheduled to release its earnings report on January 30, 2025, with projected EPS of $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year, and revenue of $124.1 billion, up 3.78% from the equivalent quarter last year. Apple's current Zacks Rank is #3 (Hold), and there have been no recent changes in EPS projections. The stock's Forward P/E ratio is 29.97, indicating a premium compared to its industry average. Based on these mixed signals, with both positive earnings projections and a premium valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling but still uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The company's stock price has been lagging behind the market, with a 13.77% loss over the previous month. However, the projected earnings per share (EPS) and revenue for the forthcoming earnings report show positive growth. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) and the premium valuation metrics, such as the Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and the PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's emphasis on AI enhancements in its latest Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup. This focus on AI and related features aims to attract users who might consider upgrading their devices. However, since Apple primarily relies on hardware sales and software ecosystem rather than AI-specific features, the direct impact on Apple's stock price might not be immediate but could affect investor sentiment negatively if it leads to speculation about a potential shift towards AI-centric competition. Nonetheless, Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and diverse product portfolio might mitigate adverse effects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news of Samsung launching an ultrathin phone ahead of Apple introduces increased competition, which may negatively affect Apple's market share and investor sentiment. While Apple plans to counter with its own ultrathin model later in the year, the immediate threat from Samsung could lead to a downturn in stock price, especially given the history of Apple's pricing strategy and the mixed reaction to its products in recent times. Previous predictions indicate a range of sentiments leaning towards negativity due to competitive pressures, resulting in a higher probability of stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market with Samsung and Google partnering. While the AR market is still nascent, this intensifies the competitive landscape. Previous rounds show varying predictions, with a slight leaning towards a negative impact on Apple stock, although some models acknowledge Apple's strengths and potential for positive growth. Considering the increased competitive pressure and mixed sentiments from previous rounds, I maintain a slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline is vague and doesn't offer actionable information.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty. Several models highlight increased competition from Samsung in various product segments (ultra-thin phones, AR glasses) as a potential negative factor.  Others point to Apple's strong brand, upcoming earnings (projected positive growth), and historical performance, suggesting a possible upward trend. The lack of concrete news in the headline renders the news itself neutral, making the prior predictions more important.  The consensus leans slightly toward a price fall, although with significant uncertainty, so I'll weight that slightly more heavily than a purely neutral prediction.  The variation in predictions across different models suggests that other, non-public information might be influencing some of these predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates that Samsung is launching an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone, potentially capturing market interest before Apple releases its own similar product. This could lead to increased competition in the smartphone market segment, particularly for premium devices. Since Apple and Samsung are primary competitors, the news may concern investors about Apple's ability to maintain its market share and impact on sales, which could exert downward pressure on AAPL's stock price. However, Apple historically performs well in the long run and may still see a positive response depending on consumer reception of its upcoming products. Therefore, the stock might be more likely to fall in the short term with significant uncertainty about the competitive landscape ahead. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a slight negative impact, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 0.53% increase to $223.83, which lagged behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Over the previous month, Apple's shares have declined by 13.77%, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500. The article highlights that Apple's earnings report is scheduled for January 30, 2025, with projected EPS of $2.36 (an 8.26% increase) and revenue of $124.1 billion (a 3.78% rise). The current Zacks Rank for Apple is #3 (Hold), and there have been no recent changes in EPS projections. Apple's valuation metrics, such as a Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and a PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a premium compared to its industry averages. Considering these mixed signals, with both positive earnings projections and a premium valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling but still uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news reports that Apple's stock price has been lagging behind the market, with a 13.77% loss over the previous month. However, the projected earnings per share (EPS) and revenue for the forthcoming earnings report show positive growth. The Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) and the premium valuation metrics, such as the Forward P/E ratio of 29.97 and the PEG ratio of 2.18, indicate a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering the mixed signals from the news, including both positive earnings projections and a premium valuation, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling. Additionally, other models' predictions indicate a range of probabilities, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to increased competition, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to Apple's strong market position and brand loyalty. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Samsung's emphasis on AI enhancements in its latest Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup. This focus on AI and related features aims to attract users who might consider upgrading their devices. Given Apple primarily focuses on hardware innovations and an integrated software ecosystem, the immediate competitive threat may not be significant. Moreover, Apple has a strong market position, resilient brand loyalty, and a diverse product portfolio which can help mitigate any adverse impact of increased competition from Samsung. The news does not provide substantial information regarding the financial health or strategic initiatives of Apple beyond this event, leaving room for mixed investor sentiments. Overall, the probability of the stock price falling is somewhat influenced by competitive pressures, but the strengths of Apple's market position suggest a relatively balanced outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
