(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline discusses AI stocks poised for growth, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. as one of those stocks. While Apple is involved in AI technologies and can benefit indirectly, the absence of targeted mention may result in limited direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Thus, while there is enthusiasm for AI investments, it may not lead to a significant upward movement in Apple's stock specifically.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on AI stocks potentially reaching a $4 trillion valuation, and while Apple is involved in AI, the headline does not explicitly state Apple is one of the mentioned stocks, nor does it delve into Apple's AI contributions. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock is uncertain. However, positive sentiment surrounding AI could indirectly benefit Apple. Given the lack of direct association, the probability of price movement is estimated modestly tilting towards a rise due to general AI hype.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not name Apple (AAPL) as one of them.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be due to unrelated market factors or pre-existing investor sentiment, not the information contained within this article. We should assume the probability of price change due to this specific news is negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to its potential in the AI sector, as per a Wall Street analyst's prediction. Such positive analyst coverage, especially with ambitious targets like reaching $4 trillion by 2025, can generate investor optimism and buying interest. Historical trends show that positive analyst projections often lead to short-term price increases. However, the prediction is speculative and depends on multiple factors like execution, market conditions, and competition. The probability of a price rise is higher than a fall, but the magnitude of the rise is uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests two AI stocks to buy before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the headline or content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a well-established company and not directly mentioned, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. A slight edge might be given to the stock price rising due to general market optimism, but it's not a direct or strong catalyst.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street Analyst. This implies a positive outlook for the company's future performance, which could lead to an increase in investor confidence and subsequently, a rise in stock price. The mention of a specific and significant growth target ($4 trillion) adds credibility to the analyst's prediction, further supporting the potential for a stock price increase.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While this implies potential growth in the AI sector, which could benefit Apple indirectly, the lack of direct mention limits the likelihood of significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Sentiment around AI may provide some positivity to Apple's stock, but it is not a strong catalyst for movement. Therefore, I estimate the probabilities for a price rise are modestly tilted to the higher side at around 0.55, while the probability of a price fall remains relatively balanced at 0.45.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two unnamed AI stocks projected to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple is not explicitly mentioned. While Apple is involved in AI, the lack of direct mention significantly limits the direct impact of this news on its stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a relatively high probability of a price rise due to indirect positive sentiment around AI, and others assigning a neutral or even slightly negative probability due to the irrelevance of the news to Apple. Considering the absence of direct mention and the spread of opinions, I lean toward a neutral stance.  The overall market sentiment and other news impacting Apple will likely be more influential on its stock price than this particular headline. The weighted average of the previous predictions shows a slight tendency towards a price rise, but this slight tendency is not a significant catalyst.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not explicitly name Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of them. While Apple is involved in AI technologies, the lack of direct mention in the news suggests that the impact on AAPL's stock price may be minimal or neutral. Previous predictions show mixed opinions, with some models seeing a slight positive bias due to general AI optimism, while others see no direct impact. Considering the absence of targeted mention and the speculative nature of the prediction, the probabilities are estimated to be neutral with a slight bias towards no significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, but it does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is involved in AI technologies, the lack of direct mention suggests that the immediate impact of this news on AAPL's stock price may be limited. However, the overall positive sentiment around AI could indirectly benefit Apple. Given the mixed reactions from various models, it seems that the general consensus leans towards a slight positive impact due to the indirect benefits of AI hype, but with considerable uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the potential growth of AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting two AI stocks will soar to $4 trillion by 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned as one of these stocks. Despite this, Apple is involved in AI technologies and could benefit indirectly from the positive sentiment around AI investments. Considering the varied predictions from other models, with some indicating a potential rise due to general AI enthusiasm and others suggesting minimal direct impact, a moderate estimation seems appropriate. The absence of a direct mention of Apple in the headline or content means the news is not specifically bullish for AAPL, but the overall positive AI sector outlook could have a slightly positive effect on the stock.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). There is speculation about the potential inclusion of Apple in the list of stocks based on the involvement of AI technologies. However, the news does not explicitly mention Apple. The predictions made in the previous rounds show a wide range of probabilities, from very optimistic to highly pessimistic views. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that Apple is a well-established company with a diversified portfolio beyond AI, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate and influenced by other market factors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
