(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The headline discusses AI stocks and mentions a potential capitalization of $4 trillion by 2025. Although Apple is not explicitly mentioned as one of the '2 AI stocks,' it is a significant player in technology and AI integration. This can positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple, given its historical performance in tech innovation and growth. However, as Apple is not directly linked to this analysis, the impact may be muted. Thus, the probabilities reflect a slight bullish sentiment based on its reputation and market context.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline highlights AI stocks potentially soaring. While Apple may benefit from the general positive sentiment around AI, the article doesn't explicitly state Apple is one of the two companies predicted to reach a $4 trillion valuation. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely moderate. A rise is more probable than a fall, but it won't be a dramatic shift. The headline could attract more investors in AI-related companies providing a slight advantage. However, without explicit mention or linkage to the forecast, not so high to be a strong indication of rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not name Apple (AAPL) as one of them.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be due to unrelated market factors or pre-existing investor sentiment, not the information contained within this article. We should assume the probability of price change due to this specific news is negligible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an AI stock with potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such optimistic projections, especially from a credible source, often generate positive sentiment among investors, leading to increased buying interest. However, the actual impact on the stock price depends on market conditions, investor confidence, and broader economic factors. Given the positive tone of the headline, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but it is not guaranteed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to soar to a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst, due to its involvement in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This prediction could lead to increased investor confidence and interest in the company, potentially driving up its stock price. However, it's essential to note that such predictions can be subjective and influenced by various market and economic factors. The news is generally positive, indicating a potential increase in stock price as investors may perceive AAPL as a growth stock in the AI sector.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. is one of the 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks to buy before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street Analyst. This indicates a strong positive outlook for the company's future performance, driven by its involvement in the AI sector. As a result, it is likely that investors will react positively to this news, leading to an increase in the stock price. The mention of a specific and significant growth projection ($4 trillion) adds credibility to the analyst's prediction, further supporting the potential for a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline indicates a bullish outlook on AI stocks with significant projections for growth. Although Apple Inc. is not explicitly named as one of the two AI stocks mentioned, it is widely recognized as a key player in technology and AI innovation. This connection could enhance investor sentiment towards Apple, as it may be inferred that the company benefits from positive trends in the AI sector. The predictions from others reflect varying degrees of optimism, with some viewing the news as moderately positive and others estimating negligible impact. I believe that the overall sentiment leans towards a bullish outlook for Apple, supported by its reputation and market position. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary point of contention among the previous predictions is whether the news headline explicitly states that Apple (AAPL) is one of the two AI stocks poised to soar. If Apple *is* one of the mentioned stocks, the probability of a price increase becomes high. However, if it is merely implicit that Apple *could* be one of them, or the news is simply about the AI sector overall, then the increase likelihood is substantially reduced, or even indicates a likely drop in price. Given the vagueness, I infer from the round 0 responses that most models implicitly think or assume that Apple *is not* one of the two mentioned AI stocks, therefore the price is unlikely to significantly increase, unless future evidence suggests otherwise. Considering the variety of AI analysis capabilities, and the ambiguity of the news itself, I will slightly adjust the probability toward a higher likelihood of price decrease, but not excessively so, given that AI industry news may still influence AAPL. Also, one model has already indicated a high likelihood of price decrease (0.1 rise, 0.9 fall), which might indicate outside information not present in the AI models.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two unnamed AI stocks projected to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple is not explicitly mentioned. While Apple's involvement in AI could lead to some positive spillover, the lack of direct connection makes a significant price movement unlikely. The previous predictions show a divergence of opinions; some models believe there's a moderate chance of a price rise due to general AI sentiment, others see the news as irrelevant. Considering the lack of direct relevance and the spread in previous predictions, I lean towards a neutral stance.  The slightly higher probability of a price rise reflects the possibility of a small positive impact from general AI market optimism, but the effect is expected to be minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks predicted to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, but does not explicitly name Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is a significant player in technology and AI, the lack of direct mention in the headline reduces the immediate impact of this news on its stock price. However, the overall positive sentiment around AI stocks could indirectly benefit Apple, given its reputation and market position. Previous predictions from other models varied, with some suggesting a moderate bullish sentiment (probabilities around 0.6-0.7 for rise) and others indicating minimal impact (probabilities around 0.1-0.5 for rise). Given this mixed but generally neutral-to-positive outlook, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of them. However, considering Apple's significant presence in the technology and AI integration sector, there could be a mild positive impact on investor sentiment. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there's a divided opinion, with some models considering the news irrelevant to Apple's stock price and others seeing it as mildly positive due to Apple's involvement in AI. Given the general positive sentiment around AI stocks and Apple's reputation in tech innovation, I estimate a slight leaning towards a probability of the stock price rising, but the impact is likely to be moderate due to the lack of direct mention.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. The previous predictions show varied opinions, but most models suggest a mild to moderate positive impact due to Apple's reputation and historical performance. Some models argue the specific news has negligible impact, especially considering the lack of direct mention of AAPL.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks set to potentially soar to $4 trillion by 2025. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not specifically mentioned, its strong reputation in technology and AI could lead to some positive sentiment in the market. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general bullish outlook from several models despite the ambiguity surrounding Apple's explicit involvement. This results in a moderate probability of the stock price rising, albeit not a certainty due to the lack of direct linkage to the news, which results in a slightly higher probability of falling as well.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two AI stocks, not explicitly naming Apple. While Apple is a major player in the AI space, the lack of direct mention makes the impact on Apple's stock price ambiguous. Previous rounds of predictions display a range of opinions, from negligible impact to moderate positive impact due to general AI sector sentiment. In round zero, predictions were varied, with some models initially bullish but one model predicting a strong fall. In Round 1, there's a shift towards neutrality, with most predictions hovering around 0.5 for rise and fall. One model sharply decreased its prediction of a price rise, indicating potentially negative information. Considering the ambiguity of the news, the varied opinions in previous rounds, and the potential negative information inferred from the changes between rounds, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall but acknowledge the positive AI market sentiment could provide some upward support.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two unnamed AI stocks projected to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation. Apple is not explicitly mentioned.  While Apple's involvement in AI is undeniable, this news lacks direct relevance. The previous predictions are highly varied, showing no clear consensus. Some models see moderate potential for a rise due to general AI market positivity, others deem it irrelevant.  The lack of direct connection to Apple diminishes the news' impact significantly.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the disparity in prior predictions, I will estimate the probability of price movement in relation to this information as near neutral, with the slight upward skew reflecting the possibility of a marginal positive impact from broader AI market sentiment, but overall that influence is likely to be minimal. The trend between Round 0 and Round 1 shows that the models are converging towards a more neutral stance, reducing initial overly optimistic or pessimistic assessments.  This convergence towards a neutral prediction suggests that the models are self-correcting and refining their understanding of the news' impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks predicted to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025 but does not explicitly name Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is a significant player in technology and AI, the lack of direct mention in the headline reduces the immediate impact of this news on its stock price.

(AAPL). Despite the lack of direct mention, Apple is a significant player in technology and AI integration, which could lead to a mild positive impact on investor sentiment. The previous predictions from other models show a divided opinion, with some considering the news irrelevant to Apple's stock price and others seeing it as mildly positive due to Apple's involvement in AI. Given the general positive sentiment around AI stocks and Apple's reputation in tech innovation, I estimate a slight leaning towards a probability of the stock price rising. However, the impact is likely to be moderate due to the lack of direct mention.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025 but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. is recognized as a key player in AI and technology, and although it is not explicitly mentioned, its involvement in AI could indirectly influence positive sentiment among investors. The predictions from earlier rounds show mixed sentiments, with some predicting a moderate to high probability of a stock price rise, others leaning towards a neutral or negligible impact, and a few predicting a lower probability of a rise. Given Apple\u2019s strong presence in the AI sector and its historical positive performance, there may be a marginal positive sentiment, despite the lack of direct mention.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
