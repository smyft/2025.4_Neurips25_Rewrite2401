(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The headline discusses AI stocks and mentions a potential capitalization of $4 trillion by 2025. Although Apple is not explicitly mentioned as one of the '2 AI stocks,' it is a significant player in technology and AI integration. This can positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple, given its historical performance in tech innovation and growth. However, as the news does not directly implicate Apple, the stock price movement may see a lower probability of rise compared to a direct endorsement. Therefore, there is a moderate chance the stock could rise due to general optimism in the tech sector while the probability of decline is relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline highlights AI stocks potentially soaring. While Apple may benefit from the general positive sentiment around AI, the article doesn't explicitly state Apple is one of the two mentioned stocks, nor does it firmly link Apple to the AI stock market. This makes the impact on AAPL uncertain and any movement based on speculation. Therefore, the impact would likely be minimal. It is also possible that AI stocks may rise to `$4 trillion in value by 2025`, but this doesn't necessarily translate to rapid and substantial change to AAPL short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not name Apple (AAPL) as one of them.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be due to unrelated market factors or pre-existing investor sentiment, not the information contained within this article. We will assume the probability of price change is based on the general market conditions and Apple's news outside the given article. A neutral stance is taken here with slightly higher probability for no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is identified as one of the AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such positive analyst predictions, especially from reputable sources, often lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity, which can drive the stock price up in the short term. However, the actual movement will also depend on broader market conditions, company performance, and other external factors. Given the optimistic tone of the headline, the probability of a price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests two AI stocks to buy before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks rather than specifically about Apple. Given that Apple is a large and well-established company with a significant presence in the tech industry, the impact of this particular news on its stock price seems minimal. The news does not provide direct positive or negative information about Apple, so the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. However, given the nature of stock markets, some indirect effects or interpretations might still influence the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks that could soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This indicates a positive outlook for the company's future growth and potential in the AI sector. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will rise due to this news, as investors may become more optimistic about the company's prospects. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The models that see a positive impact tend to assign a higher probability of the stock price rising. Models that recognize the lack of direct connection give lower probabilities and more weight to other factors.
