(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks rather than specifically about Apple. Given that Apple is a large and well-established company with a significant presence in the tech industry, the impact of this particular news on its stock price seems minimal. The news does not provide direct positive or negative information about Apple, so the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. However, given the nature of stock markets, some indirect effects or interpretations might still influence the stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.05,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.05\n}\n```"
