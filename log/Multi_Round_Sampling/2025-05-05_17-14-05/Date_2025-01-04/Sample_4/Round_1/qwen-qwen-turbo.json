      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline discusses AI stocks poised for growth, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. as one of those stocks. While Apple is involved in AI technologies and can benefit indirectly, the absence of targeted mention may result in limited direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Thus, while there is enthusiasm for AI investments, it may not lead to a significant upward movement in Apple's stock specifically.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on AI stocks potentially reaching a $4 trillion valuation, and while Apple is involved in AI, the headline does not explicitly state Apple is one of the mentioned stocks, nor does it tie this potential valuation directly to Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is uncertain and less direct compared to companies directly mentioned as poised for AI-driven growth. The general market sentiment around AI is positive, potentially providing a slight boost, but the lack of direct Apple mention tempers this effect. Considering mixed sentiment, I estimate a slight positive probability, but acknowledge there is a probability that this will not change stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not name Apple (AAPL) as one of them.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be due to unrelated market factors, not this specific article.  We assume a neutral probability of price change, attributing minor fluctuations to general market noise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is identified as one of the AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Positive analyst recommendations and projections, especially those involving significant growth potential, often lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity. Given Apple's strong market position, brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in AI, the news is likely to be perceived favorably by the market. However, the actual impact may be tempered by broader market conditions and the speculative nature of long-term projections.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst predicts two AI stocks will soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, the headline and content do not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks. The news is focused on AI stocks in general and their potential to rise to $4 trillion, but it does not provide direct positive or negative information about Apple Inc. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, but slightly leaning towards a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks that a Wall Street Analyst believes will soar to $4 trillion in 2025. This indicates a positive outlook for the company's future growth and valuation. As a result, it is likely that investors will react positively to this news, driving up the stock price. The analyst's prediction of a significant increase in valuation implies a high level of confidence in the company's AI capabilities and future prospects.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
