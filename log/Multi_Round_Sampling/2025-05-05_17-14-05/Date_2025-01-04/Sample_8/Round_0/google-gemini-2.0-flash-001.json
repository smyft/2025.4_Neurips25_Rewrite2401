Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is uncertain and less direct compared to companies directly mentioned as poised for AI-driven growth. The general market sentiment around AI is positive, potentially providing a slight boost, but the lack of direct Apple mention tempers this effect. Considering mixed sentiment, I estimate a slight positive probability, but acknowledge there is a probability that this will not change stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
