(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content as one of the stocks. Given that AAPL is already a large-cap company and a leader in AI integration through products like Siri, Apple Watch, and more, the news might not have a direct positive impact on its stock price. The lack of direct mention and the speculative nature of the target could lead to a neutral or slightly negative reaction as investors might already have high expectations for AAPL's AI capabilities. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a relatively higher probability of it falling or staying neutral due to this news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
