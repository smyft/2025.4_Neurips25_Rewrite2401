(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content as one of the stocks. Given that AAPL is already a large-cap company and a leader in the tech industry, but not specifically highlighted in the context of AI stocks to reach $4 trillion, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral or mildly positive at best. The probability of a significant rise or fall based on this news seems low, but given the nature of stock markets, some positive sentiment might be derived from the general bullish tone on tech stocks.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45,\n}\n```"
