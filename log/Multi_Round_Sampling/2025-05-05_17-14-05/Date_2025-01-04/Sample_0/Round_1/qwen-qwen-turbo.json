      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline discusses AI stocks poised for growth, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. as one of those stocks. While Apple is involved in AI technologies and can be indirectly influenced by the overall positive sentiment towards AI investments, the lack of direct mention could limit the immediate impact on its stock. Therefore, there is a moderate chance of stock price rise due to broader market optimism but also a notable risk of stagnation or decline given the uncertainty around its direct involvement in the specific stocks mentioned.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on AI stocks potentially reaching a $4 trillion valuation, and while Apple is involved in AI, the headline does not explicitly state Apple is one of the mentioned stocks, nor does it delve into Apple's AI contributions. Therefore, the direct impact on Apple's stock is uncertain. However, positive sentiment surrounding AI could indirectly benefit Apple. Given the lack of direct association, the probability of price movement is estimated modestly tilting towards a rise due to general AI hype.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not name Apple (AAPL) as one of them.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL's price following this news would be due to unrelated market factors, not this specific article. We can assume the probability of a price change due to this specific news is approximately equal to the baseline probability of the stock moving in either direction on a given day, which is unlikely to be significantly different from 0.5 for either rise or fall.  However, since the news is irrelevant, the probabilities of rise or fall approach 0.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an AI stock, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth potential by 2025. Positive analyst recommendations, especially those highlighting future growth in high-potential sectors like AI, often lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity. Given Apple's strong brand, market position, and ongoing investments in AI, the news is likely to be perceived favorably by the market. However, the actual stock movement will also depend on broader market conditions and other company-specific factors not mentioned in the headline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, including Apple Inc., as a Wall Street analyst predicts they will soar to $4 trillion in 2025. This implies a significant potential for growth in the AI sector, which could positively impact Apple's stock price. Given Apple's involvement in AI through its various products and services, such as Siri and machine learning integrations, the company is likely to benefit from this trend. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
