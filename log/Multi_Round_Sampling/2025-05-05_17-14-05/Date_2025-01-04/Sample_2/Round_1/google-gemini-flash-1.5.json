      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The headline discusses AI stocks poised for growth, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. as one of those stocks. While Apple is involved in AI technologies and can be indirectly influenced by the overall positive sentiment towards AI investments, the lack of direct mention could mean investors may not react as strongly. Therefore, there is a moderate chance of stock price rise due to broader market optimism but also a notable risk of stagnation or decline given the uncertainty around direct implications for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on AI stocks potentially reaching a $4 trillion valuation, and while Apple is involved in AI, the headline does not explicitly state Apple is one of the mentioned stocks, nor does it tie this potential valuation directly to Apple. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is uncertain and less direct compared to companies directly mentioned as poised for AI-driven growth. The general market sentiment around AI is positive, potentially providing a slight boost, but the lack of direct Apple mention tempers this effect. Considering mixed sentiment, I estimate a slight positive probability, but acknowledge there is a probability that this will not change stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not name Apple (AAPL) as one of those stocks.  Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any movement in AAPL price following this news would be due to unrelated market factors or general investor sentiment, not directly influenced by the stated prediction. We can assume the market reaction to this news will be minimal and any price change is related to other factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a Wall Street analyst predicts significant growth in the AI sector, potentially leading to a $4 trillion valuation by 2025. Such optimistic analyst predictions often generate positive sentiment among investors, leading to increased buying activity. Given Apple's strong position in the tech industry and its ongoing investments in AI, the news is likely to be perceived positively. However, the actual impact on the stock price will depend on broader market conditions and investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst predicts two AI stocks will soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks. While Apple is a major tech company involved in AI research and development, the lack of direct mention in the context of the analyst's prediction makes it uncertain whether this news will have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The general positive sentiment around AI stocks might have a mild positive effect, but it's not a direct recommendation for Apple. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be slightly positive due to the general favorable outlook on tech and AI stocks, but not strongly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. is one of the 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks to buy before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street Analyst. This indicates a strong positive outlook for the company's future performance, driven by its involvement in the AI sector. As a result, it is likely that investors will react positively to this news, leading to an increase in the stock price. The mention of a specific and significant growth projection ($4 trillion) adds credibility to the analyst's prediction, further supporting the potential for a stock price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news mentions two AI stocks and does not directly reference Apple Inc. (AAPL). It is possible that the broader positive sentiment around AI stocks might slightly positively impact AAPL as it is also an AI player, but there is no direct indication that AAPL is the focus of this specific news. Therefore, based on the given information, there's no strong reason to believe the stock price of AAPL would be significantly impacted.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While Apple is involved in AI, the lack of direct mention significantly weakens the direct impact of this news on its stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, from a low of 0.1 probability of a price rise to a high of 0.8.  The consensus leans slightly towards a higher probability of a rise, but this is largely due to general positive sentiment around AI and Apple's existing position in the market, not directly from this specific news. The fact that several models assigned a roughly even chance of a price rise or fall supports the idea that the news itself is not a major factor. Therefore, I'm assigning a probability closer to the median of the prior predictions, acknowledging the uncertainty introduced by the news's indirect relevance to Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n"
