(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks to buy. Given that the news is about other AI stocks reaching a significant valuation, it is unlikely to have a direct positive impact on AAPL's stock price. The probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to this news is low because the news does not specifically highlight AAPL as one of the stocks with potential. Conversely, the probability of the stock price falling is also low as the news is neutral or slightly positive for the tech industry in general, but not specifically about AAPL.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```"
