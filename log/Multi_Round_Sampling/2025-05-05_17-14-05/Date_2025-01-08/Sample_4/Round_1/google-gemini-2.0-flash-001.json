      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Nvidia Needs to Appeal to a Bigger Crowd\nNews Content: Investors are hyper-focused on data centers despite big new efforts in gaming, self-driving cars and robotics.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses Nvidia and its need to appeal to a broader audience beyond data centers, highlighting areas like gaming and self-driving cars. While this indirectly relates to Apple, it suggests potential competition in markets where Apple is also investing (e.g., gaming). However, since the focus is primarily on Nvidia, the impact on Apple's stock is less direct. Therefore, AAPL's stock could see minor fluctuations but is less likely to be heavily affected. The overall sentiment around Nvidia does not strongly correlate with Apple\u2019s stock, leading to a conservative estimate of stock price movements.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Nvidia (NVDA) and its need to broaden its appeal beyond data centers. While this doesn't directly impact Apple (AAPL), the mention of areas where Nvidia is investing, such as gaming and self-driving cars, which are also areas of focus for Apple. The article highlights a potential vulnerability for Nvidia if it doesn't succeed in diversifying. If Nvidia weakens in these shared domains, it MIGHT OPEN OPPORTUNITIES for Apple. However, the impact is indirect and probably small: This article seems to have little to no impact on Apple so its stock price is unlikely to fluctuate very much.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia (NVDA), not Apple (AAPL).  The headline and content discuss Nvidia's investor focus and diversification efforts beyond data centers. This news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is extremely low.  Any movement is likely due to unrelated market factors or Apple-specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Nvidia's focus on various sectors like gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics, but the article is about Nvidia, not Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not directly pertain to Apple, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but rather discuss Nvidia's efforts and focus areas. Since the news does not mention Apple or its activities, it is reasonable to assume that the news will have little to no direct impact on Apple's stock price. However, as Nvidia is a major player in the technology sector, including areas like gaming and data centers, there could be indirect effects based on how Nvidia's strategies and investments are perceived by the market. If Nvidia's efforts are seen positively, it could reflect well on the tech sector as a whole, potentially benefiting Apple indirectly. Conversely, if Nvidia's focus on broader areas beyond data centers is seen as a distraction or a risk, it might negatively affect the perception of the tech sector. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be relatively balanced but leaning towards a minimal impact.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news is focused on Nvidia and its need to appeal to a broader audience, emphasizing its focus on data centers while making significant efforts in gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price movements. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

(2) Tech Sector Sentiment: News regarding a major tech player like Nvidia can indirectly influence the overall sentiment surrounding the tech sector, potentially impacting Apple.
