While this indirectly relates to Apple, it suggests potential competition in markets where Apple is also investing (e.g., gaming). However, since the focus is primarily on Nvidia, the impact on Apple's stock is less direct. Therefore, AAPL's stock could see minor fluctuations but is less likely to be heavily affected. The overall sentiment around Nvidia does not strongly correlate with Apple\u2019s stock, leading to a conservative estimate of stock price movements.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Nvidia Needs to Appeal to a Bigger Crowd\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
