      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Nvidia Needs to Appeal to a Bigger Crowd\nNews Content: Investors are hyper-focused on data centers despite big new efforts in gaming, self-driving cars and robotics.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news discusses Nvidia and its need to appeal to a broader audience beyond data centers, highlighting challenges rather than advancements. Since this news does not directly pertain to Apple but instead focuses on Nvidia, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Market reactions to news about competitors can influence Apple indirectly, but given that the news is not tied to Apple's core operations or performance, I estimate a higher probability for stability rather than direct movement. Therefore, I assign a low probability for both rise and fall, suggesting that the market may not react strongly to this news as it pertains to Nvidia's strategy rather than a change affecting Apple directly.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Nvidia (NVDA) and its need to broaden its appeal beyond data centers. While this doesn't directly impact Apple (AAPL), the mention of areas where Nvidia is investing, such as gaming and self-driving cars, which are also areas of focus for Apple. The article highlights a potential vulnerability for Nvidia if it doesn't succeed in diversifying. If Nvidia weakens in these shared domains, it MIGHT OPEN OPPORTUNITIES for Apple. However, the impact is indirect and probably small: This article seems to have little to no impact on Apple so its stock price is unlikely to fluctuate very much.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia (NVDA), not Apple (AAPL).  The headline and content discuss Nvidia's investor focus and diversification efforts beyond data centers. This news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price changing due to this news is extremely low.  Any movement is likely due to unrelated factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline and content focus on Nvidia's efforts in gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics, and how investors are primarily focused on data centers. Since the news is about Nvidia and not Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal and not directly correlated.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article appears to focus on Nvidia and its efforts in various sectors. Since there is no direct mention or implication related to Apple's business, products, or performance, it is unlikely that this news will have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news as low. The probabilities reflect a neutral stance with slight inclination towards no significant change, but given the format requires a rise or fall probability, I've assigned a minimal change implication.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content do not directly mention or relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), but rather focus on Nvidia's efforts and investor focus. As a result, this news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, given that Nvidia is a major player in the tech industry and Apple is also a prominent company in the same sector, there could be some indirect effects or market sentiment shifts. Nevertheless, without direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of stock price movement are largely neutral.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The financial news is focused on Nvidia and its need to appeal to a broader audience, emphasizing its focus on data centers while making significant efforts in gaming, self-driving cars, and robotics. Since the headline does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL), it's unlikely to have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price movements. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
