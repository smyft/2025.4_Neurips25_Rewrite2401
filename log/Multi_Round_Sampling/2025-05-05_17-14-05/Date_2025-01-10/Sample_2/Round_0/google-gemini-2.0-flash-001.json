This endorsement typically has a positive impact on investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased demand and a higher stock price. However, it is important to remember that this is just one factor impacting Apple's stock. The impact may be limited if this information is already mostly reflected into the price or if other factors (like broader economic uncertainties or Apple specific challenges) arise. Moreover, the article says it is invested in other stocks as well.
