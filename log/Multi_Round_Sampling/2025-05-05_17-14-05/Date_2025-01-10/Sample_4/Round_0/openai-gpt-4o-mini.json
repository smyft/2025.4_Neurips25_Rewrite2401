If Apple Inc. is one of these stocks (and many often speculate that it could be), this news could signal strong market confidence in Apple, potentially leading to increased demand for its shares. Consequently, this may lead to a price rise in the near term. However, as the news does not explicitly confirm Apple as one of the nine stocks, there remains uncertainty that could lead to a slight chance of a price drop if market participants feel misled. Overall, the news is positive for Apple, but ambiguity about inclusion reduces confidence slightly.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.70,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.30\n}"
