      "content": "```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news headline mentions that Warren Buffett has a significant portion of his portfolio invested in 9 'unstoppable' stocks, with Apple being one of them (implied, not explicitly stated).  While this is positive sentiment, the information is vague and lacks specifics.  It doesn't mention any new investments or changes in his Apple position.  The 'unstoppable' claim is subjective and hyperbolic. The fact that this is about Buffett's 2025 portfolio implies that this is a long-term holding rather than a short term recommendation driving immediate price shifts. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term. While positive sentiment can usually increase a stock's price, the lack of specifics and long-term focus of the headline severely limits the impact.  The overall market conditions and Apple's own performance will have far greater impact than this news alone.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
