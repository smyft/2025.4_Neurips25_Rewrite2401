Consider Top Gun Instead?\nNews Content: If sentiment is anything to go by, the Magnificent 7 stocks, led by Apple Nvidia and Microsoft are set to be replaced by a movie that may or may not be equally good\u2014BATMMAAN. While cute names are fun to write about, they\u2019re a lousy way to organize a stock portfolio. Think of it as the DC comics superhero spelled by a toddler.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) and instead discusses SoftBank and its holdings. Since this news is not directly related to Apple's operations, products, or financial results, it is unlikely to significantly influence the stock price of AAPL in either direction. Therefore, the probabilities of stock price rise and fall are both low, indicating a stable situation for AAPL in the context of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests significant confidence from a highly respected investor (Warren Buffett) in a select few companies, including Apple. While the exact allocation to each stock isn't specified, the fact that Apple is likely among the top holdings signals positive sentiment. Investors often follow Buffett's lead, and his continued confidence could encourage further investment, driving the price up. However, the news is somewhat vague and doesn't represent new information, necessarily. Buffett's large holdings in Apple are widely known. Thus the impact may be muted. Also, market sentiments will overall depends on more concrete factors.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline \"What Companies Does SoftBank Own?\" is completely unrelated to Apple Inc.  The article's content focusing on SoftBank's portfolio companies provides no information whatsoever about Apple's financial performance, prospects, or any potential interactions between the two companies. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this news will have any significant impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors, and not this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any substantive financial or operational information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article is more of a commentary on market sentiment and the use of catchy names for stock groupings, rather than any direct impact on Apple's business performance, earnings, or market position. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of relevant information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that 80% of Warren Buffett's $297 billion portfolio is invested in 9 unstoppable stocks, but it does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of them. However, given Warren Buffett's historical investment in Apple, it's possible that AAPL is one of the stocks he is referring to. The news suggests a positive outlook on the stocks held by Buffett, which could imply a positive sentiment towards Apple if it is indeed one of those stocks. However, without direct confirmation, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain but potentially positive due to the association with Buffett's investment strategy.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The news is about SoftBank and the companies it owns, which does not inherently imply any direct impact on Apple's stock price. Without specific information linking SoftBank's holdings or actions to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that this news will have a minimal direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be close to equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance of the news to Apple Inc.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news content focuses solely on SoftBank and does not provide any relevant information or insights about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Most predictions from others reflect a consensus that this news is unlikely to have a significant impact on AAPL's stock price, with several predicting low probabilities for both rising and falling prices. While there is some speculation about potential associations with Warren Buffett's investments, these are not directly relevant to the current news. Therefore, I assess that the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling are fairly balanced, indicating a stable market sentiment regarding this specific news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on Warren Buffett's investment strategy and highlights his concentration in a few key stocks. While it doesn't explicitly name Apple, the content implies AAPL is highly likely to be one of those stocks, given Buffett's substantial historical investment in Apple. This reinforces a positive sentiment around Apple. The previous rounds show mixed predictions, some correctly inferring a positive link to Apple, others focusing excessively on the vagueness. Considering the general positive sentiment surrounding Buffett's investment choices and Apple's likelihood of being in his top holdings, I'm estimating a higher probability of the stock price rising. Prior rounds also highlighted that the fact Buffett holds Apple is known, and the extent of weighting is new information. It is more than whether Buffet owns Apple, it is how much of Apple he owns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline 'What Companies Does SoftBank Own?' is irrelevant to Apple Inc.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, largely reflecting the lack of direct connection between the news and Apple's stock price.  While some models attempt to draw indirect connections (e.g., through Warren Buffett's investments, which is not even mentioned in this news article), these are tenuous at best. The dominant trend among previous predictions is that the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction.  Therefore, I assign a low probability to both price increases and decreases.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are largely irrelevant to Apple Inc. (AAPL) as they discuss market sentiment and the use of catchy names for stock groupings, rather than any direct impact on Apple's business performance, earnings, or market position. The mention of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which includes Apple, is not accompanied by any substantive financial or operational information. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the lack of relevant information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Warren Buffett's portfolio, which is invested in 9 stocks, but it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, given that Warren Buffett has historically held a significant position in Apple, it's plausible that AAPL could be one of the stocks in question. The positive sentiment associated with Buffett's investment strategy and his confidence in his top holdings could indirectly boost Apple's stock price if investors follow his lead. However, since the news does not provide specific information about Apple, the impact is likely to be muted. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are close to equal, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the potential positive association with Buffett's investments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not contain any information directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The news is about SoftBank and the companies it owns, which does not inherently imply any direct impact on Apple's stock price. Without specific information linking SoftBank's holdings or actions to Apple, it's reasonable to assume that this news will have a minimal direct impact on Apple's stock price. Considering the predictions from previous rounds, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the news has little to no direct relevance to Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be close to equal, reflecting the lack of direct relevance of the news to Apple Inc.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
