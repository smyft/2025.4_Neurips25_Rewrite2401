The news suggests a positive outlook on the stocks held by Buffett, which could imply a positive sentiment towards Apple if it is indeed one of those stocks. However, without direct confirmation, the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain but potentially positive due to the association with Buffett's investment strategy.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
