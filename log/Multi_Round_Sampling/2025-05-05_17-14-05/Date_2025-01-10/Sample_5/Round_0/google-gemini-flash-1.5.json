While a TikTok ban could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue, the magnitude of such an impact is likely to be relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue streams.  Apple's revenue is highly diversified and a TikTok ban is a relatively low percentage contributor.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause significant stock price movement.
