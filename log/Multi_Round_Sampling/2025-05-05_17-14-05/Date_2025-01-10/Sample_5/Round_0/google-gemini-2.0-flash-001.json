A ban on TikTok could potentially benefit competing platforms available on Apple's App Store, leading to increased downloads and revenue for these apps. However, the impact is likely to be small compared to Apple's overall size and diversified revenue streams. Also, it is important to consider that this news is regarding a ban on other company, not a negative impact for Apple. Therefore, my initial impression is that the news event only has slight impact on the AAPL movement. I assign both 'rise' and 'fall' probabilities near 0.5. After considering all factors, my reasoning is as follows: Increased usage on other competing apps could potentially benefit Apple; however, this could be balanced by negative brand perception due to the politics nature around the ban. Therefore the movement is going to be small, and the event probably has little to no impacts on AAPL.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
