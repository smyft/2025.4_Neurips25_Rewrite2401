(AAPL) as one of those stocks. However, given Warren Buffett's known investment in Apple and the positive context of the news, we can infer a neutral to slightly positive impact. The news does not provide specific information that would significantly alter the stock price of Apple directly, but Warren Buffett's confidence in his top picks could indirectly support Apple if it is among them. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the overall market sentiment that typically follows Buffett's investment moves.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
