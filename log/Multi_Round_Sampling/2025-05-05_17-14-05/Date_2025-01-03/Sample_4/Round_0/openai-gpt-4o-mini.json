While the luxury market's strength might indicate overall economic health, it is not a sufficient factor to influence stock price predictions specifically for AAPL. The primary market drivers for Apple include product launches, earnings reports, and technological advancements rather than real estate trends. Therefore, the probabilities for significant movements in Apple's stock price based on this news are minimal, suggesting that any changes would likely be in the normal volatility range rather than a direct response to the luxury property market.\";\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"The Nine-Figure Home Sale Isn\u2019t Going Anywhere\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
