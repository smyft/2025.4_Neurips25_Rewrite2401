It appears to be a neutral or possibly speculative article about Apple's stock performance in 2025. Without specific details on the content that would influence the stock price positively or negatively, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced. However, given that the article is questioning whether Apple is a buy, sell, or hold, it suggests uncertainty rather than a clear negative or positive catalyst. Therefore, I estimate the probabilities based on this neutral to slightly uncertain stance.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Is Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
