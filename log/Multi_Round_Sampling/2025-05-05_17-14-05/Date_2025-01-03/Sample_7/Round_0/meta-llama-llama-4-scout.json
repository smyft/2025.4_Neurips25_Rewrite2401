(AAPL) as one of these stocks. However, Apple is known for its significant investments and advancements in AI technology. The lack of direct mention does not necessarily imply a negative impact on Apple's stock, as the company is still a major player in the tech industry and a component of the S&P 500. Given that the news does not provide direct negative information about Apple, and considering the company's strong position in the market, the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on this news alone seems to lean slightly towards a neutral or positive outlook. However, without specific details linking Apple directly to the AI stocks mentioned, the impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the neutral to positive implications of AI involvement, albeit indirectly.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 28.8% of the Entire S&P 500 Index\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
