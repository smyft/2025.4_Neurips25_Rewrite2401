      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, with analysts like Dan Ives expressing confidence that Wall Street is underestimating the potential impact of AI investments. This optimism about AI CapEx spending and its implications for earnings could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple, especially given its upcoming earnings report. While there is always a risk of disappointment if earnings do not meet expectations, the overall tone suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: This news article pertains to allegations of discriminatory pricing practices by ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber in India, where Apple users were supposedly charged higher fares. While Apple is indirectly mentioned, the core issue revolves around the pricing policies of Ola and Uber, not Apple's business operations or financial performance directly. The fact that Apple hasn't responded suggests a low level of concern on their part. Therefore, the likelihood of this news impacting Apple's stock price is very minimal. Any price movement would likely be due to broad market trends rather than this specific news item. A more severe issue would arise if the allegations were specific to Apple's platform (e.g., security vulnerability that caused fraud) so this event is unlikely to have any significant material impact. The overall risk is very low for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) falling.  Since Apple is a major technology company, it's likely to be affected by this broader market trend.  However, without access to the full news article's content,  it's impossible to determine the magnitude of the sector's decline or any specific factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, I'm assuming a higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledging a degree of uncertainty.  The probabilities reflect a general negative sentiment based on the limited information available.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article features a warning from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the high valuation of leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group. Dalio suggests that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Given Dalio's reputation and influence in the financial markets, his comments could lead to increased investor caution. Additionally, the article mentions broader concerns about the US debt situation and potential economic challenges, which could further weigh on investor sentiment towards high-valuation stocks like Apple. Based on this analysis, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has moved veteran executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division. This move suggests that Apple is strengthening its capabilities in AI and machine learning, which are critical areas for future growth and innovation. Given Vorrath's experience in managing complex products, this reassignment could be seen as a positive step towards enhancing Apple's AI and machine learning initiatives. Therefore, I estimate that there is a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, with a focus on the potential for massive AI spending by companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. Analyst Dan Ives believes that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of this spending, and that it could lead to a significant boost for the tech sector. Specifically, Ives highlights Meta's plans to spend up to $65 billion on AI capital expenditures, which could lead to increased growth and monetization opportunities. While the article does not directly mention Apple's AI spending plans, it implies that the company will also be investing heavily in AI. As a result, the overall tone of the article is positive for the tech sector, suggesting that the stock prices of these companies may rise due to increased investor confidence and expectations of future growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
