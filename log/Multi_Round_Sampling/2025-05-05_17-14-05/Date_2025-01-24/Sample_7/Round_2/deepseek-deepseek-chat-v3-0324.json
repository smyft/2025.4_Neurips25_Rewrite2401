(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, with analysts like Dan Ives expressing confidence that Wall Street is underestimating the potential impact of AI investments. This optimism about AI CapEx spending and its implications for earnings could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple, especially given its upcoming earnings report. While there is always a risk of disappointment if earnings do not meet expectations, the overall tone suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: This news article pertains to allegations of discriminatory pricing practices by ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber in India, where Apple users were supposedly charged higher fares. While Apple is indirectly mentioned, the core issue revolves around the pricing policies of Ola and Uber, not Apple's business operations or financial performance directly. The fact that Apple hasn't responded suggests a low level of concern on their part. Therefore, the likelihood of this news impacting Apple's stock price is very minimal. Any price movement would likely be due to broad market trends rather than this specific news item. A more severe issue would arise if the allegations were specific to Apple's platform (e.g., security vulnerability that caused fraud) so this event is unlikely to have any significant material impact. The overall risk is very low for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) falling.  Since Apple is a major technology company, it's likely to be affected by this broader market trend.  However, without access to the full news article's content,  it's impossible to determine the magnitude of the sector's decline or any specific factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, I'm assuming a higher probability of a price fall, but acknowledging a degree of uncertainty.  The probabilities reflect a general negative sentiment based on the limited information available.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article features a warning from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the high valuation of leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group. Dalio suggests that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Given Dalio's reputation and influence in the financial markets, his comments could lead to increased investor caution. Additionally, the article mentions broader concerns about the US debt situation and potential economic challenges, which could further weigh on investor sentiment towards high-valuation stocks like Apple. Based on this analysis, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple has moved veteran executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division. This move suggests that Apple is strengthening its capabilities in AI and machine learning, which are critical areas for future growth and innovation. Given Vorrath's experience in managing complex products, this reassignment could be seen as a positive step towards enhancing Apple's AI and machine learning initiatives. Therefore, I estimate that there is a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, with a focus on the potential for massive AI spending by companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. Analyst Dan Ives believes that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of this spending, and that it could lead to a significant boost for the tech sector. Specifically, Ives highlights Meta's plans to spend up to $65 billion on AI capital expenditures, which could lead to increased growth and monetization opportunities. While the article does not directly mention Apple's AI spending plans, it implies that the company will also be investing heavily in AI. As a result, the overall tone of the article is positive for the tech sector, suggesting that the stock prices of these companies may rise due to increased investor confidence and expectations of future growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights optimism regarding Big Tech earnings and specifically mentions increased AI capital expenditures, which could positively influence Apple given its upcoming earnings report. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Wall Street is underestimating the potential impact of AI spending on growth and monetization, which feeds into favorable investor sentiment for Apple as a key player in the tech sector. Therefore, based on this positive outlook and anticipation of upcoming earnings, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news addresses allegations against Ola and Uber regarding discriminatory pricing, not Apple directly. While Apple products are mentioned, the core issue lies with the ride-hailing companies' practices. Given the indirect connection, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. While Round 0 models had varying opinions (some positive due to broader tech optimism, some negative due to unrelated market factors), the general consensus pointed towards low Apple stock impact. This indirect impact reinforces a neutral view. Therefore, the stock movement will likely be influenced by broader market trends rather than this specific news. Furthermore, the fact that Ola and Uber have denied the allegations and are cooperating with the consumer protection authority further suggests a contained issue that should not significantly impact Apple's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in the tech sector, which is likely to negatively impact Apple.  However, the lack of detail in the provided news snippet prevents a precise assessment of the impact on Apple specifically.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models highlighting positive factors like potential AI investment and others emphasizing negative factors such as broader sector trends and concerns about high valuations.  The overall sentiment from the previous predictions leans slightly negative. Given the limited information and the conflicting predictions, I will assign a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge a significant degree of uncertainty. The probability of a rise is weighted down by the negative sector news and the uncertainty associated with it.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline features a warning from billionaire investor Ray Dalio about the high valuation of leading stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is part of the 'Magnificent Seven' group. Dalio suggests that these stocks are expensive and could be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Given Dalio's reputation and influence in the financial markets, his comments could lead to increased investor caution. Additionally, the article mentions broader concerns about the US debt situation and potential economic challenges, which could further weigh on investor sentiment towards high-valuation stocks like Apple. Based on this analysis, there is a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports that Apple has reassigned veteran executive Kim Vorrath to its AI and Machine Learning division. This move suggests that Apple is strengthening its capabilities in AI and machine learning, which are critical areas for future growth and innovation. Given Vorrath's experience in managing complex products, this reassignment could be seen as a positive step towards enhancing Apple's AI and machine learning initiatives. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, but overall, there is a slightly positive outlook based on the reassignment of Vorrath and the general optimism around AI investments in the tech sector. Therefore, I estimate that there is a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings, with a focus on the potential for massive AI spending by companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. Analyst Dan Ives believes that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of this spending, and that it could lead to a significant boost for the tech sector. Specifically, Ives highlights Meta's plans to spend up to $65 billion on AI capital expenditures, which could lead to increased growth and monetization opportunities. While the article does not directly mention Apple's AI spending plans, it implies that the company will also be investing heavily in AI. As a result, the overall tone of the article is positive for the tech sector, suggesting that the stock prices of these companies may rise due to increased investor confidence and expectations of future growth. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of models estimating a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling due to broader market trends or concerns. However, the majority of models agree that the news has a positive sentiment towards Apple, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple has reassigned a seasoned executive to its AI and Machine Learning division. This move suggests a strategic push toward advancements in AI, which could be perceived as a positive signal for investors given the growing importance of AI and Machine Learning in the tech industry. While previous predictions show varied sentiments, the overall trend leans positive because several models predicted an increase in stock price due to AI-related developments. Weighing all factors, including historical predictions and the significance of AI in today\u2019s tech landscape, the reassigned executive's role is likely to be seen as a beneficial move.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
