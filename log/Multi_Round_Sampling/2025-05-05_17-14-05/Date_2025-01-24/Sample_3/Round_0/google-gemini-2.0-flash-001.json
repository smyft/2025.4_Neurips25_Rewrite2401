Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

Although Apple earnings are mentioned as coming up on Thursday, the central theme revolves around AI investments and their potential for growth and monetization, particularly for companies like Meta. While broadly supportive for the tech sector, the immediate impact on Apple is less direct compared to, say, Meta. The analyst's commentary is optimistic, but primarily focuses on AI build-out, impacting companies investing more heavily in AI. However, this positive sentiment in the sector may provide increased investor confidence, leading to moderate growth in the stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
