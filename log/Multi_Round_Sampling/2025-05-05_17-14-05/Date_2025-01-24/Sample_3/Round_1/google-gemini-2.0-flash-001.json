      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with a strong track record in managing complex software projects, to the AI and machine learning division is a strategic move by Apple to improve its AI capabilities, especially in light of criticisms regarding Siri's performance. Although the company has been lagging behind its competitors in AI, this appointment may signal a more focused approach to rectify its shortcomings. However, current concerns about Siri's effectiveness and the delays in rolling out advanced features may dampen immediate investor confidence. Overall, the news is slightly positive due to the experienced leadership but is tempered by the challenges facing Apple's AI advancements. Therefore, the probability of stock price rise is estimated to be 0.55 and of falling at 0.45.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on overall Big Tech earnings with a positive sentiment, specifically highlighting Dan Ives' view that Wall Street is 'underestimating' tech due to massive AI spending. Although Apple earnings are mentioned as coming up on Thursday, the central theme revolves around AI investments and their potential for growth and monetization, particularly for companies like Meta. While broadly supportive for the tech sector, the immediate impact on Apple is less direct compared to, say, Meta. The analyst's commentary is optimistic, but primarily focuses on AI build-out, impacting companies investing more heavily in AI. However, this positive sentiment in the sector may provide increased investor confidence, leading to moderate growth in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses options trading strategies for the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of mega-cap tech companies that includes Apple.  The expert, Jessica Inskip, mentions that options trading allows for analysis of potential price movements, indicating expectations of \"large moves\" in both upward and downward directions. However, the article provides no specific information about Apple or any factors that would suggest a higher probability of a price increase or decrease for Apple specifically. The focus is on options trading strategies, not fundamental or specific news related to Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease remains largely unchanged based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices. While the article mentions broad market trends, it does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct impact on its stock. Given that Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven and the overall market sentiment is positive, there is a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price. However, without company-specific news, the impact is likely muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide specific information that would impact its stock price. The news discusses the overall market performance under President Trump's return to office, compares FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and mentions bitcoin and gold prices. As Apple is part of the broader market and often lumped with Big Tech, a generally positive market trend could indirectly benefit AAPL. However, without specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the probabilities are based on the overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple moving a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, to the AI and machine learning division could be seen as a positive development for the company, indicating a focus on innovative technologies that are increasingly important in the tech industry. This move suggests Apple is investing in areas that could lead to future growth and competitiveness. However, the immediate impact on stock price might be minimal since the news is more about strategic positioning rather than an announcement of a new product, service, or significant financial development. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to the positive long-term implications of the move, but the overall impact is likely to be muted.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Considering all the previous predictions in round 0, most models have hovered around 0.55 for stock price rising, but my initial inclination would have been slightly lower (around 0.52).
