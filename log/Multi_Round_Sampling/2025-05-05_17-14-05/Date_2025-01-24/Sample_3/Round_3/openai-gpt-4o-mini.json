(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with a strong track record in managing complex software projects, to the AI and machine learning division is a strategic move by Apple to improve its AI capabilities, especially in light of criticisms regarding Siri's performance. Although the company has been lagging behind its competitors in AI, this appointment may signal a more focused approach to rectify its shortcomings. However, current concerns about Siri's effectiveness and the delays in rolling out advanced features may dampen immediate investor confidence. Overall, the news is slightly positive due to the experienced leadership but is tempered by the challenges facing Apple's AI advancements. Therefore, the probability of stock price rise is estimated to be 0.55 and of falling at 0.45.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on overall Big Tech earnings with a positive sentiment, specifically highlighting Dan Ives' view that Wall Street is 'underestimating' tech due to massive AI spending. Although Apple earnings are mentioned as coming up on Thursday, the central theme revolves around AI investments and their potential for growth and monetization, particularly for companies like Meta. While broadly supportive for the tech sector, the immediate impact on Apple is less direct compared to, say, Meta. The analyst's commentary is optimistic, but primarily focuses on AI build-out, impacting companies investing more heavily in AI. However, this positive sentiment in the sector may provide increased investor confidence, leading to moderate growth in the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses options trading strategies for the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of mega-cap tech companies that includes Apple.  The expert, Jessica Inskip, mentions that options trading allows for analysis of potential price movements, indicating expectations of \"large moves\" in both upward and downward directions. However, the article provides no specific information about Apple or any factors that would suggest a higher probability of a price increase or decrease for Apple specifically. The focus is on options trading strategies, not fundamental or specific news related to Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the probability of a price increase or decrease remains largely unchanged based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices. While the article mentions broad market trends, it does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct impact on its stock. Given that Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven and the overall market sentiment is positive, there is a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price. However, without company-specific news, the impact is likely muted.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide specific information that would impact its stock price. The news discusses the overall market performance under President Trump's return to office, compares FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and mentions bitcoin and gold prices. As Apple is part of the broader market and often lumped with Big Tech, a generally positive market trend could indirectly benefit AAPL. However, without specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the probabilities are based on the overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple moving a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, to the AI and machine learning division could be seen as a positive development for the company, indicating a focus on innovative technologies that are increasingly important in the tech industry. This move suggests Apple is investing in areas that could lead to future growth and competitiveness. However, the immediate impact on stock price might be minimal since the news is more about strategic positioning rather than an announcement of a new product, service, or significant financial development. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling due to the positive long-term implications of the move, but the overall impact is likely to be muted.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and machine learning division signals a strategic effort by the company to improve its AI capabilities, particularly with Siri, which has faced criticism. Her past experience with major Apple projects could enhance operational efficiency and innovation in AI. Although there are ongoing challenges with Siri's current functionality and rollout setbacks, the move reflects a commitment to addressing these issues and positioning Apple for future competitiveness in AI. Given the positive outlook on Apple's initiative to bolster its AI team and improve Siri, there is a slightly increased probability that the stock price will rise as investor confidence may be positively impacted, despite existing concerns. Therefore, I estimate a 0.57 probability of the stock price rising and 0.43 for falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on a general positive outlook for Big Tech driven by AI investments, with Dan Ives of Wedbush highlighting that Wall Street may be underestimating the potential of AI CapEx, particularly for companies like Meta. While Apple is mentioned, the primary focus is on companies more directly involved in large-scale AI deployment. The overall sentiment suggests positive momentum for tech stocks as a whole. Considering all the previous predictions in round 0, most models have hovered around 0.55 for stock price rising, but my initial inclination would have been slightly lower (around 0.52). Given the continued positive sentiment in the news and no significantly conflicting information, the probability of AAPL rising remains marginally bolstered by the general tech bullishness. The news item does not provide specific information about Apple, the impact is likely to be muted. Given other expert predictions about the stock price, I suspect there might be a rise in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven', a group including Apple, and doesn't offer specific information impacting AAPL's stock price.  Expert commentary suggests expectations of significant price swings (both up and down) for the tech sector, but this is a general market outlook, not Apple-specific.  Previous predictions range from 0.5 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, with most models leaning slightly positive but acknowledging the lack of direct Apple-related news. Given the absence of specific positive or negative news for Apple in this article and the overall neutral to slightly positive sentiment from other models based on other news, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the general optimism surrounding the tech sector, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Magnificent Seven, the article does not provide any company-specific information or direct impact on its stock. Given the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's inclusion in the Magnificent Seven, there is a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price. However, without specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the impact is likely muted. Previous predictions also indicate a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, with probabilities hovering around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated based on the overall market trend and lack of company-specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss general market trends, specifically mentioning the surge in US equity markets during President Trump's first week back in office. The news compares FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), and tracks bitcoin and gold prices approaching record highs. While the news does not provide specific information about Apple or any direct impact on its stock, the overall positive market sentiment could indirectly benefit AAPL. Given that Apple is part of the broader market and often lumped with Big Tech, there is a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price. However, without specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the probabilities are based on the overall positive market sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and machine learning division is a strategic move by Apple, signaling a more focused approach to improving its AI capabilities. Although the news is positive due to the experienced leadership, it's tempered by the challenges facing Apple's AI advancements. Considering previous predictions from other models, which showed a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price, I will take into account the overall positive market sentiment and the potential for increased investor confidence. Given the information, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments affecting the tech sector as a whole, with Apple's specific news pointing towards current challenges such as declines in iPhone sales and concerns regarding consumer interest in AI. Recent analyst downgrades and market valuations indicate caution among experts, further pressuring the stock price. Despite the broader positive market sentiment due to the 'Stargate' project and AI investments, the immediate negative news for Apple outweighs the positive tech sector momentum.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a seasoned Apple executive, to improve AI capabilities and Siri is a strategic move indicating Apple's commitment to enhancing its technology in the face of stiff competition. While there are ongoing concerns about Siri's effectiveness and the challenges Apple faces in AI compared to competitors, the news suggests a potential shift in strategy that could bolster investor confidence. Previous predictions lean towards slight positivity, averaging around 0.55 for stock price increases. Given this context, I estimate a probability of 0.56 for the stock price rising, reflecting a cautious optimism. However, challenges remain, leading to a probability of 0.44 for falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on a generally positive outlook for Big Tech due to anticipated earnings and AI investments, as highlighted by Dan Ives. While Apple's earnings are mentioned, the emphasis is primarily on the AI CapEx build-out, benefiting companies like Meta more directly. Although the overall sentiment leans positive for the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple is less clear. Round 0 analysis ranged from 0.5 to 0.6 for a price rise, with Round 1 showing stable to slightly decreased estimations influenced by mixed AI news. The one outlier in Round 1 was qwen/qwen-turbo predicting a significant fall, citing negative news for Apple. Given that there's no very specific, strong positive trigger for Apple, but the broader tech optimism is present and considering the outlier I will adjust my prediction slightly downward compared to earlier predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news piece is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement. It focuses on options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven,' a group including Apple, but offers no Apple-specific news or insights.  The expert quoted mentions expectations of large price swings (both up and down) in the tech sector generally, but this lacks specificity for Apple.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning slightly towards a rise, but this is primarily based on other, unrelated news (like internal appointments or general market trends) rather than this specific article.  Given the lack of pertinent information in the provided news, I'm basing my prediction on the overall consensus of the previous models and the general market sentiment for tech stocks, which tends to be somewhat positive but volatile. The probabilities reflect the inherent uncertainty of the market and the weak predictive power of the given news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the Magnificent Seven, the article does not provide any company-specific information or direct impact on its stock. Given the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's inclusion in the Magnificent Seven, there is a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price. However, without specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the impact is likely muted. Previous predictions also indicate a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, with probabilities hovering around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated based on the overall market trend and lack of company-specific news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss a general market surge during President Trump's first week back in office, comparing FANG and Magnificent Seven stocks, and tracking bitcoin and gold prices.

However, without specific catalysts mentioned for Apple, the impact is likely muted. Previous predictions from other models have also indicated a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, with probabilities generally hovering around 0.55 for a rise and 0.45 for a fall. Therefore, considering the positive market trend and the lack of negative news specific to Apple, the probabilities are estimated with a slight bias towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news of Apple moving a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, to the AI and machine learning division indicates a strategic effort to improve its AI capabilities. This move could potentially address current challenges such as Siri's performance and competitiveness in the AI sector. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which showed a slight inclination towards a potential rise in AAPL's stock price, and taking into account the overall positive market sentiment, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. However, it's essential to note that the immediate impact on the stock price might be minimal, as the news is more about strategic positioning rather than a new product or significant financial development. The mixed sentiments affecting the tech sector, current challenges, and recent analyst downgrades also influence the prediction. Given the information and the trend of previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be around 0.58, and the probability of the stock price falling is around 0.42.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments affecting the tech sector as a whole, with Apple's specific news pointing towards current challenges such as declines in iPhone sales and concerns regarding consumer interest in AI. Recent analyst downgrades and market valuations indicate caution among experts, further pressuring the stock price. Despite the broader positive market sentiment due to the 'Stargate' project and AI investments, the immediate negative news for Apple outweighs the positive tech sector momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
