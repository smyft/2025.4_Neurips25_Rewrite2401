(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stocks to watch next week: ASML, Intel, LVMH, Shell and Glencore\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as five of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nTesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will be releasing results next week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML, as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nRead more: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH's results can add to optimism.\n\nShell's latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by newly reinstated US president Donald Trump on lowering prices.\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore, which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nASML (ASML.AS) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter and full-year results on Wednesday 29 January\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early, which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nSince October's results release, ASML stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML.AS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole.

Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

A late afternoon dip in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund suggests a negative sentiment affecting the tech sector as a whole. Given this context, it's likely that Apple's stock would follow the trend of sector weakness, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The anticipated earnings beat in Q1 2025 is a positive catalyst, potentially driving the stock price up in the immediate short term. However, the warning about a weak March quarter and lowered iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are significant concerns. While BofA remains bullish due to factors like strong cash flow and potential product launches (iPhone SE), the reduced price target and the specific negatives regarding iPhone sales,especially slower adoption of AI, weigh on the stock. The statement around China sales being 'overdone' appears to be a hopeful statement rather than a concrete fact. Considering this mixed signal, coupled with the downward revision in sales forecasts, an initial bump up followed by a struggle to maintain that level is very plausible. Therefore, probability of stock price fall is set higher than stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back DEI programs, facing resistance from major corporations.  Apple is mentioned specifically as having a shareholder vote on DEI policies coming up in February. While Trump's actions could potentially create some negative sentiment around DEI-focused companies in the short-term, the article highlights that many companies like Apple are pushing back.  The long-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The shareholder vote itself presents some uncertainty, but the overall context suggests that reaction against Apple related to this issue will be muted.  More significant factors influencing AAPL stock price are likely to be overall market conditions, Apple's product releases, and economic indicators, not a single political initiative targeting DEI.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants reporting earnings next week, which will attract significant investor attention. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have a substantial impact on its stock price due to its market weight and investor expectations. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's expected performance, only mentioning that it is part of a broader group of companies reporting. Given the lack of negative or positive cues specifically about Apple in the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is balanced but slightly skewed towards a rise due to general investor optimism around tech earnings. The broader market sentiment, including policy comments from Trump, could also introduce volatility, but this is not directly tied to Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On one hand, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, which could positively impact the stock price. On the other hand, they forecast weak March quarter results due to declining iPhone sales and macroeconomic headwinds. Despite cutting iPhone sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026, BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The adjusted price target of $253, down from $256, suggests a relatively stable outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but with a cautious tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs can have positive economic benefits. Additionally, the fact that companies like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and Costco are defending their diversity policies suggests that there is a growing corporate resistance to the rollback of DEI programs. This could lead to a positive perception of Apple's commitment to DEI, potentially boosting its stock price. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance, and the outcome of the vote in February is uncertain, which introduces some uncertainty into the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has a new executive in the AI division, Kim Vorrath, who is known for her expertise in program management and product development. This suggests that Apple is doubling down on its efforts to improve AI and Siri, which could be positive for the company's long-term growth prospects. However, it also highlights ongoing challenges and delays in their AI initiatives compared to competitors. The arrival of a new executive may be seen as a strong signal that the company is serious about addressing these issues, potentially leading to positive investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a decline in the tech sector, which generally reflects negative sentiment affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL) alongside other tech stocks. Historical data indicates that stocks within a sector often move in tandem, particularly in short time frames. While there are some positive expectations regarding Apple's earnings and product launches, the immediate impact of a sector-wide downturn and concerns regarding declining iPhone sales significantly outweighs these factors. The previous predictions suggest a prevailing belief that adverse news has a stronger influence on stock price movement than potential bullish catalysts. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is greater than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. A strong Q1 is expected, which is positive. However, the weak guidance for the March quarter and the lowered iPhone sales forecasts for FY25 and FY26 are significant negatives. While BofA remains bullish, the reduced price target from $256 to $253 indicates caution. Considering the mixed signals and the generally negative trend across the predictions of models in round 0 leads me to weigh these factors carefully, leading to slightly conservative probability values. Others previously seem to show a slight upward trend but I think they got ahead of themselves without considering that the negatives slightly outweigh the positives in this report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, with Apple facing a shareholder vote on its own DEI policies in February. While this could introduce short-term market volatility, the article highlights significant corporate resistance to these rollbacks.  Companies like Apple, Nasdaq, JPMorgan, and Costco are actively defending their DEI programs which suggests that the potential negative impact on Apple's stock price from this news is limited. The long-term impact of this political initiative on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal compared to factors such as overall market conditions, product releases, and economic indicators. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but overall lean slightly towards a rise. Considering the relatively weak connection between the news and Apple's core business and financial performance, and given the corporate pushback against the DEI rollbacks, it's reasonable to assign a higher probability to the stock price remaining stable or slightly rising than falling significantly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants set to report earnings next week, which typically attracts significant investor attention. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's expected performance, only mentioning it as part of a broader group. Given the lack of negative or positive cues specifically about Apple in the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is balanced. However, previous predictions show a slight skew towards a rise due to general investor optimism around tech earnings and Apple's historical performance post-earnings. The broader market sentiment, including policy comments from Trump, could introduce some volatility, but this is not directly tied to Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values.

This suggests Apple is seriously tackling their AI shortcomings, which have led to delays and competitive disadvantages. While the market might appreciate the step toward addressing these issues, the mixed reactions from previous predictions and the continued challenges in AI development versus competitors might mitigate immediate positive sentiment. The overall expectation is a slight increase in investor confidence, but skepticism remains due to ongoing challenges.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a general decline in the tech sector, which typically suggests a negative sentiment impacting stocks like Apple Inc. Although there are mixed signals regarding Apple's expected earnings performance and potential product launches, the immediate influence of a sector-wide downturn and concerns over declining iPhone sales significantly weigh on the stock's outlook. Previous predictions illustrate a tendency for pessimism, with many leaning towards an increased probability of a stock price fall. Therefore, despite some positive expectations, the prevailing sentiment seems to favor a downturn in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The anticipation of strong Q1 2025 earnings is a positive factor that could drive the stock price up initially. However, BofA's warning about a weak March quarter and reduced iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are substantial concerns that will weigh on the stock. The adjusted price target, although remaining bullish, is lowered from $256 to $253, adds to the cautious sentiment. I am adjusting my probabilities to move lower than the group due to the very specific negative statements about iPhone sales and the forward looking statements for Q2. Considering these factors in combination, while an initial bump is possible, the negative forecasts weigh more heavily, resulting in a higher probability of a stock price decrease overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, with Apple facing a shareholder vote in February.  While this could create short-term market volatility, the larger context suggests limited impact on Apple's stock price.  Many major corporations are resisting these rollbacks, including Apple, which demonstrates a commitment to DEI values. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but generally lean toward a slight increase in probability for a price rise, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 This, along with the fact that the news doesn't address Apple's financial performance, suggests that any impact from this news will be secondary to broader market factors and Apple\u2019s product performance.  The shareholder vote adds uncertainty, but the prevailing corporate stance against the rollbacks mitigates potential negative effects. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with the majority of probability near the 0.5 range.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which typically attracts significant investor attention. However, the article does not provide specific details or forecasts about Apple's performance, focusing instead on broader market trends and other companies like ASML, Intel, and Shell. Given the lack of specific negative or positive cues about Apple in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by general market sentiment and sector performance. Historical trends suggest that tech stocks often move together, especially around earnings seasons. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models indicating a higher probability of a rise due to general optimism around tech earnings, while others highlight sector-wide declines. Considering the absence of direct negative news about Apple and the potential for positive investor sentiment around its earnings report, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall movement remains uncertain due to the lack of specific catalysts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

While the market might appreciate the step toward addressing these issues, the mixed reactions from previous predictions and the continued challenges in AI development versus competitors might mitigate immediate positive sentiment. The overall expectation is a slight increase in investor confidence, but skepticism remains due to ongoing challenges.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The recent news about a sector-wide decline in tech stocks impacts Apple negatively, suggesting a lack of investor confidence. Previous predictions historically indicate a trend towards bearish sentiment due to concerns about declining iPhone sales and potential macroeconomic challenges. Although there are some positive factors regarding anticipated earnings and product launches, the prevailing negative sentiment around the tech sector reduces the likelihood of a price rise for Apple. This leads to an estimation favoring a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a strong Q1 2025 earnings report is expected, which should positively impact the stock in the short term, the weak guidance for the March quarter and lowered iPhone sales forecasts for FY25 and FY26 raise significant concerns. The BofA's adjusted price target downwards, even while maintaining a bullish stance, indicates underlying apprehension. The predictions from previous rounds are quite varied, however, the majority are in the .5 range, reflecting the uncertainty that I see in this report. \n\nBalancing the anticipated short-term gains from strong Q1 earnings against the longer-term concerns about declining iPhone sales, the overall outlook seems cautiously negative. Thus, the stock price falling seems more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, with Apple facing a shareholder vote in February.  While this could create short-term market volatility, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Major corporations, including Apple, are resisting these rollbacks, demonstrating a commitment to DEI and suggesting the negative impact will be limited.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, generally leaning slightly toward a price rise (averaging around 0.5), but converging. This, along with the fact that the news doesn't directly address Apple's financial performance, suggests that any impact from this news will be secondary to broader market factors and Apple's product performance. The shareholder vote adds uncertainty, but the corporate resistance mitigates potential negative effects.  Considering the overall market sentiment toward tech and Apple's performance, and the limited direct impact of the news, a relatively neutral stance is warranted, slightly favoring a stable or slightly rising price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which typically attracts significant investor attention. However, the article does not provide specific details or forecasts about Apple's performance, focusing instead on broader market trends and other companies like ASML, Intel, and Shell. Given the lack of specific negative or positive cues about Apple in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by general market sentiment and sector performance. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models indicating a higher probability of a rise due to general optimism around tech earnings, while others highlight sector-wide declines. Considering the absence of direct negative news about Apple and the potential for positive investor sentiment around its earnings report, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall movement remains uncertain due to the lack of specific catalysts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 2025 earnings to beat estimates, which could drive the stock price up. Additionally, Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches, such as the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem, are seen as positive factors. However, the weak guidance for the March quarter, lowered iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, and concerns about macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are significant negatives. The adjusted price target from $256 to $253 also suggests a cautious outlook. Considering the mixed signals and the range of opinions from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling but with a cautious tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
