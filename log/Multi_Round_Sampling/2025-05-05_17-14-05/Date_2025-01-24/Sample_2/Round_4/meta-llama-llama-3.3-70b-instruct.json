(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including Apple's, are generally declining. A late afternoon dip in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund suggests a negative sentiment affecting the tech sector as a whole. Given this context, it's likely that Apple's stock would follow the trend of sector weakness, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The anticipated earnings beat in Q1 2025 is a positive catalyst, potentially driving the stock price up in the immediate short term. However, the warning about a weak March quarter and lowered iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are significant concerns. While BofA remains bullish due to factors like strong cash flow and potential product launches (iPhone SE), the reduced price target and the specific negatives regarding iPhone sales,especially slower adoption of AI, weigh on the stock. The statement around China sales being 'overdone' appears to be a hopeful statement rather than a concrete fact. Considering this mixed signal, coupled with the downward revision in sales forecasts, an initial bump up followed by a struggle to maintain that level is very plausible. Therefore, probability of stock price fall is set higher than stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back DEI programs, facing resistance from major corporations.  Apple is mentioned specifically as having a shareholder vote on DEI policies coming up in February. While Trump's actions could potentially create some negative sentiment around DEI-focused companies in the short-term, the article highlights that many companies like Apple are pushing back.  The long-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The shareholder vote itself presents some uncertainty, but the overall context suggests that reaction against Apple related to this issue will be muted.  More significant factors influencing AAPL stock price are likely to be overall market conditions, Apple's product releases, and economic indicators, not a single political initiative targeting DEI.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants reporting earnings next week, which will attract significant investor attention. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have a substantial impact on its stock price due to its market weight and investor expectations. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's expected performance, only mentioning that it is part of a broader group of companies reporting. Given the lack of negative or positive cues specifically about Apple in the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is balanced but slightly skewed towards a rise due to general investor optimism around tech earnings. The broader market sentiment, including policy comments from Trump, could also introduce volatility, but this is not directly tied to Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On one hand, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, which could positively impact the stock price. On the other hand, they forecast weak March quarter results due to declining iPhone sales and macroeconomic headwinds. Despite cutting iPhone sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026, BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The adjusted price target of $253, down from $256, suggests a relatively stable outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but with a cautious tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs can have positive economic benefits. Additionally, the fact that companies like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and Costco are defending their diversity policies suggests that there is a growing corporate resistance to the rollback of DEI programs. This could lead to a positive perception of Apple's commitment to DEI, potentially boosting its stock price. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance, and the outcome of the vote in February is uncertain, which introduces some uncertainty into the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has a new executive in the AI division, Kim Vorrath, who is known for her expertise in program management and product development. This suggests that Apple is doubling down on its efforts to improve AI and Siri, which could be positive for the company's long-term growth prospects. However, it also highlights ongoing challenges and delays in their AI initiatives compared to competitors. The arrival of a new executive may be seen as a strong signal that the company is serious about addressing these issues, potentially leading to positive investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights a decline in the tech sector, which generally reflects negative sentiment affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL) alongside other tech stocks. Historical data indicates that stocks within a sector often move in tandem, particularly in short time frames. While there are some positive expectations regarding Apple's earnings and product launches, the immediate impact of a sector-wide downturn and concerns regarding declining iPhone sales significantly outweighs these factors. The previous predictions suggest a prevailing belief that adverse news has a stronger influence on stock price movement than potential bullish catalysts. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is greater than that of rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook. A strong Q1 is expected, which is positive. However, the weak guidance for the March quarter and the lowered iPhone sales forecasts for FY25 and FY26 are significant negatives. While BofA remains bullish, the reduced price target from $256 to $253 indicates caution. Considering the mixed signals and the generally negative trend across the predictions of models in round 0 leads me to weigh these factors carefully, leading to slightly conservative probability values. Others previously seem to show a slight upward trend but I think they got ahead of themselves without considering that the negatives slightly outweigh the positives in this report.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, with Apple facing a shareholder vote on its own DEI policies in February. While this could introduce short-term market volatility, the article highlights significant corporate resistance to these rollbacks.  Companies like Apple, Nasdaq, JPMorgan, and Costco are actively defending their DEI programs which suggests that the potential negative impact on Apple's stock price from this news is limited. The long-term impact of this political initiative on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal compared to factors such as overall market conditions, product releases, and economic indicators. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but overall lean slightly towards a rise. Considering the relatively weak connection between the news and Apple's core business and financial performance, and given the corporate pushback against the DEI rollbacks, it's reasonable to assign a higher probability to the stock price remaining stable or slightly rising than falling significantly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants set to report earnings next week, which typically attracts significant investor attention. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's expected performance, only mentioning it as part of a broader group. Given the lack of negative or positive cues specifically about Apple in the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is balanced. However, previous predictions show a slight skew towards a rise due to general investor optimism around tech earnings and Apple's historical performance post-earnings. The broader market sentiment, including policy comments from Trump, could introduce some volatility, but this is not directly tied to Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values.

This could lead to a positive perception of Apple's commitment to DEI, potentially boosting its stock price. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance, and the outcome of the vote in February is uncertain, which introduces some uncertainty into the stock price movement. Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of direct impact on Apple's financials, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but with a cautious tone.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple enlisting a seasoned executive, Kim Vorrath, known for fixing troubled products and managing large software projects, to address AI and Siri improvements. This suggests Apple is seriously tackling their AI shortcomings, which have led to delays and competitive disadvantages. While the market might appreciate the step toward addressing these issues, the mixed reactions from previous predictions and the continued challenges in AI development versus competitors might mitigate immediate positive sentiment. The overall expectation is a slight increase in investor confidence, but skepticism remains due to ongoing challenges.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates a general decline in the tech sector, which typically suggests a negative sentiment impacting stocks like Apple Inc. Although there are mixed signals regarding Apple's expected earnings performance and potential product launches, the immediate influence of a sector-wide downturn and concerns over declining iPhone sales significantly weigh on the stock's outlook. Previous predictions illustrate a tendency for pessimism, with many leaning towards an increased probability of a stock price fall. Therefore, despite some positive expectations, the prevailing sentiment seems to favor a downturn in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The anticipation of strong Q1 2025 earnings is a positive factor that could drive the stock price up initially. However, BofA's warning about a weak March quarter and reduced iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are substantial concerns that will weigh on the stock. The adjusted price target, although remaining bullish, is lowered from $256 to $253, adds to the cautious sentiment. I am adjusting my probabilities to move lower than the group due to the very specific negative statements about iPhone sales and the forward looking statements for Q2. Considering these factors in combination, while an initial bump is possible, the negative forecasts weigh more heavily, resulting in a higher probability of a stock price decrease overall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, with Apple facing a shareholder vote in February.  While this could create short-term market volatility, the larger context suggests limited impact on Apple's stock price.  Many major corporations are resisting these rollbacks, including Apple, which demonstrates a commitment to DEI values. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but generally lean toward a slight increase in probability for a price rise, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 This, along with the fact that the news doesn't address Apple's financial performance, suggests that any impact from this news will be secondary to broader market factors and Apple\u2019s product performance.  The shareholder vote adds uncertainty, but the prevailing corporate stance against the rollbacks mitigates potential negative effects. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with the majority of probability near the 0.5 range.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which typically attracts significant investor attention. However, the article does not provide specific details or forecasts about Apple's performance, focusing instead on broader market trends and other companies like ASML, Intel, and Shell. Given the lack of specific negative or positive cues about Apple in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by general market sentiment and sector performance. Historical trends suggest that tech stocks often move together, especially around earnings seasons. The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models indicating a higher probability of a rise due to general optimism around tech earnings, while others highlight sector-wide declines. Considering the absence of direct negative news about Apple and the potential for positive investor sentiment around its earnings report, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall movement remains uncertain due to the lack of specific catalysts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values.

While the market might appreciate the step toward addressing these issues, the mixed reactions from previous predictions and the continued challenges in AI development versus competitors might mitigate immediate positive sentiment. The overall expectation is a slight increase in investor confidence, but skepticism remains due to ongoing challenges.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.22, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.78, Reasoning: The recent news about a sector-wide decline in tech stocks impacts Apple negatively, suggesting a lack of investor confidence. Previous predictions historically indicate a trend towards bearish sentiment due to concerns about declining iPhone sales and potential macroeconomic challenges. Although there are some positive factors regarding anticipated earnings and product launches, the prevailing negative sentiment around the tech sector reduces the likelihood of a price rise for Apple. This leads to an estimation favoring a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a strong Q1 2025 earnings report is expected, which should positively impact the stock in the short term, the weak guidance for the March quarter and lowered iPhone sales forecasts for FY25 and FY26 raise significant concerns. The BofA's adjusted price target downwards, even while maintaining a bullish stance, indicates underlying apprehension. The predictions from previous rounds are quite varied, however, the majority are in the .5 range, reflecting the uncertainty that I see in this report. \n\nBalancing the anticipated short-term gains from strong Q1 earnings against the longer-term concerns about declining iPhone sales, the overall outlook seems cautiously negative. Thus, the stock price falling seems more probable.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on President Trump's attempt to roll back DEI initiatives, with Apple facing a shareholder vote in February.  While this could create short-term market volatility, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Major corporations, including Apple, are resisting these rollbacks, demonstrating a commitment to DEI and suggesting the negative impact will be limited.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, generally leaning slightly toward a price rise (averaging around 0.5), but converging. This, along with the fact that the news doesn't directly address Apple's financial performance, suggests that any impact from this news will be secondary to broader market factors and Apple's product performance. The shareholder vote adds uncertainty, but the corporate resistance mitigates potential negative effects.  Considering the overall market sentiment toward tech and Apple's performance, and the limited direct impact of the news, a relatively neutral stance is warranted, slightly favoring a stable or slightly rising price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), which typically attracts significant investor attention. However, the article does not provide specific details or forecasts about Apple's performance, focusing instead on broader market trends and other companies like ASML, Intel, and Shell.

(AAPL). On the positive side, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 2025 earnings to beat estimates, which could drive the stock price up. Additionally, Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches, such as the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem, are seen as positive factors. However, the weak guidance for the March quarter, lowered iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, and concerns about macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are significant negatives. The adjusted price target from $256 to $253 also suggests a cautious outlook. Considering the mixed signals and the range of opinions from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling but with a cautious tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
