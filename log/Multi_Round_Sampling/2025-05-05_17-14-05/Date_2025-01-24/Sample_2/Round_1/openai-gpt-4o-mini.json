A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news indicates that tech stocks, including Apple's, are generally declining. A late afternoon dip in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund suggests a negative sentiment affecting the tech sector as a whole. Given this context, it's likely that Apple's stock would follow the trend of sector weakness, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall rather than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The anticipated earnings beat in Q1 2025 is a positive catalyst, potentially driving the stock price up in the immediate short term. However, the warning about a weak March quarter and lowered iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are significant concerns. While BofA remains bullish due to factors like strong cash flow and potential product launches (iPhone SE), the reduced price target and the specific negatives regarding iPhone sales,especially slower adoption of AI, weigh on the stock. The statement around China sales being 'overdone' appears to be a hopeful statement rather than a concrete fact. Considering this mixed signal, coupled with the downward revision in sales forecasts, an initial bump up followed by a struggle to maintain that level is very plausible. Therefore, probability of stock price fall is set higher than stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back DEI programs, facing resistance from major corporations.  Apple is mentioned specifically as having a shareholder vote on DEI policies coming up in February. While Trump's actions could potentially create some negative sentiment around DEI-focused companies in the short-term, the article highlights that many companies like Apple are pushing back.  The long-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely minimal. The shareholder vote itself presents some uncertainty, but the overall context suggests that reaction against Apple related to this issue will be muted.  More significant factors influencing AAPL stock price are likely to be overall market conditions, Apple's product releases, and economic indicators, not a single political initiative targeting DEI.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants reporting earnings next week, which will attract significant investor attention. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have a substantial impact on its stock price due to its market weight and investor expectations. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's expected performance, only mentioning that it is part of a broader group of companies reporting. Given the lack of negative or positive cues specifically about Apple in the news, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is balanced but slightly skewed towards a rise due to general investor optimism around tech earnings. The broader market sentiment, including policy comments from Trump, could also introduce volatility, but this is not directly tied to Apple's fundamentals.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. On one hand, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, which could positively impact the stock price. On the other hand, they forecast weak March quarter results due to declining iPhone sales and macroeconomic headwinds. Despite cutting iPhone sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026, BofA remains bullish on the stock, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The adjusted price target of $253, down from $256, suggests a relatively stable outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but with a cautious tone.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights that companies like Apple are standing firm on their DEI values. The article also mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs can have positive economic benefits. Additionally, the fact that companies like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and Costco are defending their diversity policies suggests that there is a growing corporate resistance to the rollback of DEI programs. This could lead to a positive perception of Apple's commitment to DEI, potentially boosting its stock price. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's financial performance, and the outcome of the vote in February is uncertain, which introduces some uncertainty into the stock price movement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has a new executive in the AI division, Kim Vorrath, who is known for her expertise in program management and product development. This suggests that Apple is doubling down on its efforts to improve AI and Siri, which could be positive for the company's long-term growth prospects. However, it also highlights ongoing challenges and delays in their AI initiatives compared to competitors. The arrival of a new executive may be seen as a strong signal that the company is serious about addressing these issues, potentially leading to positive investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
