(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division could be seen positively, as it indicates Apple's commitment to expanding its capabilities in AI, an area that is increasingly critical for technology companies. If investors view this move as enhancing Apple's competitiveness in emerging technologies, it could lead to increased confidence and a potential rise in stock price. However, since the news is more operational than a major strategic change or financial result, the impact on stock price may not be significant, leading to a moderate probability of increase. Conversely, without more substantial developments or financial implications attached to this news, there is also a non-negligible chance of a stock price decline, as the market may react negatively if investors perceive this as a non-impactful internal change.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance to this initiative from corporations like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and potentially Apple. While the headline suggests a potential negative impact due to the political dimension, the resistance from major corporations suggests a possible long-term stability factor. The conflict between political pressure and commitment from large institutions creates uncertainty. Since Apple faces a similar DEI vote in February, and given the focus on corporate resistance, the market will likely perceive Apple's stance on DEI may create conflict from both sides, either socially or politically. There could be reputational considerations and impact on potential employees. Therefore, the news can be viewed as a slight net neutral factor but might lead to a slight decline in stock price or trading sideways, given the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While ChatGPT ranks AAPL as the top stock for long-term growth, the article also highlights potential downsides such as Trump's planned tariffs and overall market uncertainty.  The positive aspects include Apple's strong Q4 2024 earnings exceeding expectations, the positive outlook from Wall Street analysts with an average 8% upside potential, and the potential for increased sales due to the integration of AI in the new iPhone. However, the reliance on ChatGPT's prediction introduces uncertainty, and the article itself suggests that AI stocks might offer even better returns in the shorter term.  Considering these factors, a moderate increase in probability is expected but not guaranteed, given the inherent volatility of the market and the broader uncertainties mentioned. The probability is weighted more towards a rise due to the strong Q4 results and positive analyst outlook, but the overall market conditions and the reliance on a somewhat controversial prediction method (ChatGPT) temper the confidence in a significant price surge.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating, expects strong fiscal Q1 results with revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, and highlights the resilience of Apple's earnings. The Services segment is also performing well with expected growth, and App Store revenue has shown strong demand. Additionally, potential easing of regulatory pressures and the development of an in-house 5G modem could positively impact margins. On the negative side, BofA has trimmed the price target and anticipates weaker Q2 performance with lower iPhone shipments due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Overall, the positive aspects, particularly the strong Q1 expectations and Services growth, seem to outweigh the concerns, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging different fares based on the user's phone model, such as Apple or Android. This news does not directly relate to Apple's business operations, financials, or products. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and the Indian ride-hailing market. As a result, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is low, and the probability of it falling is also low, with the majority of the impact being neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights corporate resistance to this move, including from companies like Apple (AAPL). The article mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Additionally, the fact that companies like Apple are facing shareholder votes on defending diversity policies suggests that there is strong support for these programs within the corporate world. This suggests that Apple's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, who has significant experience in core Apple technologies, to lead efforts in AI and machine learning, represents a strategic move by the company. This initiative aims to strengthen Siri and address recent AI-related challenges. While Apple has faced setbacks in AI innovation compared to its competitors, the addition of an experienced executive could potentially boost investor confidence and improve the company's competitive edge in this critical area. However, given that the news is forward-looking and the impact on actual product improvements and market reception remains uncertain, the immediate reaction might be moderate.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning Division is a strategic move that highlights the company's commitment to improving its AI capabilities, including enhancing Siri. This initiative could positively impact investor confidence, especially as the AI sector gains importance in technology. However, the news is operational rather than indicative of immediate large-scale changes or financial results, leading to moderate expectations for significant stock price movements. Considering the mixed responses from other models and the uncertainties in broader market conditions, a conservative estimate gives a higher probability of stock price rising but acknowledges a potential for slight declines due to cautious reactions from investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the tension between Trump's push to roll back DEI programs and corporate resistance, specifically mentioning Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies. While some may see the rollback as beneficial (citing costs), the article also highlights a Citigroup study showing the massive economic cost of discrimination. The fact that Apple is facing a vote, along with other companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase standing firm on their DEI values, suggests that a significant portion of the market (and potentially Apple's investors) views DEI favorably. Given this context, the market may react positively to Apple's continued support of DEI, mitigating some of the potential negative impact from Trump's initiative. Considering past models' predictions, there's a leaning towards positive, influenced by corporate resistance and potential investor support for DEI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 earnings exceeding expectations, a positive Wall Street analyst outlook with an 8% average upside potential, the integration of AI in the new iPhone potentially boosting sales, and ChatGPT ranking AAPL as a top stock for long-term growth.  However, several counterpoints exist: the reliance on a potentially unreliable prediction method (ChatGPT); potential downsides such as Trump's planned tariffs and general market uncertainty; and the suggestion within the article that other AI stocks might offer better shorter-term returns.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with several models predicting a higher probability of a price rise (0.6-0.65), and others more cautiously predicting a lower probability or even a slight fall.  Given the strong Q4 results and positive analyst sentiment, I weigh the positive factors more heavily but acknowledge the inherent uncertainties.  The overall market conditions and the reliance on ChatGPT's prediction temper the confidence in a significant price surge. The previous models' predictions show no clear trend that either rises or falls, so I'm keeping the probability closer to the mean of previous models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating, expects strong fiscal Q1 results with revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, and highlights the resilience of Apple's earnings. The Services segment is also performing well with expected growth, and App Store revenue has shown strong demand. Additionally, potential easing of regulatory pressures and the development of an in-house 5G modem could positively impact margins. On the negative side, BofA has trimmed the price target and anticipates weaker Q2 performance with lower iPhone shipments due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Overall, the positive aspects, particularly the strong Q1 expectations and Services growth, seem to outweigh the concerns, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging different fares based on the user's phone model, such as Apple or Android. This news does not directly relate to Apple's business operations, financials, or products. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The neutral nature of the news suggests that the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards no major change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights corporate resistance to this move, including from companies like Apple (AAPL). The data showing that discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020 implies that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that companies like Apple are facing shareholder votes on defending diversity policies, it suggests strong support for these programs within the corporate world. This commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. However, considering the previous predictions and the potential uncertainty and mixed reactions to such news, a moderate increase in probability of the stock price rising is expected, while also acknowledging the possibility of a decline due to potential backlash or market volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple\u2019s strategic move of appointing Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri. This appointment indicates a renewed focus on AI and machine learning, addressing recent setbacks in this area. While the move is generally viewed positively, suggesting potential strategic advancements and improvements in a critical domain, the immediate impact on the stock price remains subject to investor perception of its long-term significance. Previous predictions suggest a mix of cautious optimism, with some models predicting rises and others predicting falls. Taking these into account, the news is seen as moderately positive, yet operational changes carry lower probabilities of significantly moving the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning Division indicates the company's commitment to enhancing its capabilities in these critical areas, which could bolster investor confidence. Many models highlight this change as a moderately positive strategic move while acknowledging that the news is operational and may not lead to immediate large-scale impacts. While there is some uncertainty in the market that could lead to a slight decline, the overall interpretation of the news leans more positively due to the emphasis on AI advancement and organizational focus. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price increase and a lower probability of decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on the tension between Trump's initiatives targeting DEI programs and the resistance from corporations, including Apple. While there might be concerns about potential costs associated with DEI programs, data suggests that discrimination has significant economic costs. The fact that Apple is facing a shareholder vote on this issue, alongside the stance of other major companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase, suggests that a considerable portion of the market supports DEI initiatives. Taking into account previous models' predictions, which show a range of opinions but generally lean slightly positive, I assess a slightly increased probability that Apple's stock price will rise due to its continued commitment to DEI, mitigating potential negative impacts from the political pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  While Q4 results beat expectations and analysts are bullish with an average 8% upside potential, the reliance on a ChatGPT prediction for long-term growth introduces significant uncertainty.  The potential for Trump's tariffs to increase manufacturing costs is a downside.  The previous predictions show a range, with several models predicting a higher probability of a price rise (0.55-0.7), and others predicting a lower probability or even a slight fall (0.05). The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but the presence of significant uncertainties, including the external factors of potential tariffs and the inherent volatility of the stock market, moderates this optimism. The repeated mention of AI improvements and its potential are clearly a positive, but the lack of concrete near-term impact from this news leads to a prediction slightly skewed toward a rise, but with significant room for neutral movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating and expects strong fiscal Q1 results with revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, and the overall positive aspects outweighing the concerns, the stock price is more likely to rise. However, the trimmed price target and weaker Q2 outlook introduce some uncertainty, leading to a moderate probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article provided does not directly relate to Apple's business operations, financials, or products. It discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging different fares based on the user's phone model. This information is neutral regarding Apple's stock price movement. Given that the news does not directly impact Apple's business or financials, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, considering the overall positive sentiment from previous rounds of predictions and the lack of direct negative impact on Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which may have a negative impact on companies like Apple.
