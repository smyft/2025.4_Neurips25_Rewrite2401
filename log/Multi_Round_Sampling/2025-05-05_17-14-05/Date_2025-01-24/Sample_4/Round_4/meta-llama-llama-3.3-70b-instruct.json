(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump targets DEI programs, but corporate resistance grows\nNews Content: Wealth anchor Brad Smith highlights President Trump\u2019s initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. with the commander-in-chief targeting key initiatives like racial bias training and nondiscriminatory hiring practices.\n\nCritics argue these programs come at a cost, while data from Citigroup shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020.\n\nDespite this, companies like Nasdaq (NDAQ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are standing firm on their DEI values. Costco (COST) shareholders recently voted to defend diversity policies, and Apple (AAPL) faces a similar vote in February.\n\nCatch Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman address this shift in Corporate America's policies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n04:21\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts are 'not the solution,' says Rep.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to the AI and Machine Learning Division could be seen positively, as it indicates Apple's commitment to expanding its capabilities in AI, an area that is increasingly critical for technology companies. If investors view this move as enhancing Apple's competitiveness in emerging technologies, it could lead to increased confidence and a potential rise in stock price. However, since the news is more operational than a major strategic change or financial result, the impact on stock price may not be significant, leading to a moderate probability of increase. Conversely, without more substantial developments or financial implications attached to this news, there is also a non-negligible chance of a stock price decline, as the market may react negatively if investors perceive this as a non-impactful internal change.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and the resistance to this initiative from corporations like Nasdaq, JPMorgan Chase, and potentially Apple. While the headline suggests a potential negative impact due to the political dimension, the resistance from major corporations suggests a possible long-term stability factor. The conflict between political pressure and commitment from large institutions creates uncertainty. Since Apple faces a similar DEI vote in February, and given the focus on corporate resistance, the market will likely perceive Apple's stance on DEI may create conflict from both sides, either socially or politically. There could be reputational considerations and impact on potential employees. Therefore, the news can be viewed as a slight net neutral factor but might lead to a slight decline in stock price or trading sideways, given the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While ChatGPT ranks AAPL as the top stock for long-term growth, the article also highlights potential downsides such as Trump's planned tariffs and overall market uncertainty.  The positive aspects include Apple's strong Q4 2024 earnings exceeding expectations, the positive outlook from Wall Street analysts with an average 8% upside potential, and the potential for increased sales due to the integration of AI in the new iPhone. However, the reliance on ChatGPT's prediction introduces uncertainty, and the article itself suggests that AI stocks might offer even better returns in the shorter term.  Considering these factors, a moderate increase in probability is expected but not guaranteed, given the inherent volatility of the market and the broader uncertainties mentioned. The probability is weighted more towards a rise due to the strong Q4 results and positive analyst outlook, but the overall market conditions and the reliance on a somewhat controversial prediction method (ChatGPT) temper the confidence in a significant price surge.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating, expects strong fiscal Q1 results with revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, and highlights the resilience of Apple's earnings. The Services segment is also performing well with expected growth, and App Store revenue has shown strong demand. Additionally, potential easing of regulatory pressures and the development of an in-house 5G modem could positively impact margins. On the negative side, BofA has trimmed the price target and anticipates weaker Q2 performance with lower iPhone shipments due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Overall, the positive aspects, particularly the strong Q1 expectations and Services growth, seem to outweigh the concerns, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging different fares based on the user's phone model, such as Apple or Android. This news does not directly relate to Apple's business operations, financials, or products. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and the Indian ride-hailing market. As a result, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is low, and the probability of it falling is also low, with the majority of the impact being neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights corporate resistance to this move, including from companies like Apple (AAPL). The article mentions that data shows discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020, implying that DEI programs have economic benefits. Additionally, the fact that companies like Apple are facing shareholder votes on defending diversity policies suggests that there is strong support for these programs within the corporate world. This suggests that Apple's commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, who has significant experience in core Apple technologies, to lead efforts in AI and machine learning, represents a strategic move by the company. This initiative aims to strengthen Siri and address recent AI-related challenges. While Apple has faced setbacks in AI innovation compared to its competitors, the addition of an experienced executive could potentially boost investor confidence and improve the company's competitive edge in this critical area. However, given that the news is forward-looking and the impact on actual product improvements and market reception remains uncertain, the immediate reaction might be moderate.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning Division is a strategic move that highlights the company's commitment to improving its AI capabilities, including enhancing Siri. This initiative could positively impact investor confidence, especially as the AI sector gains importance in technology. However, the news is operational rather than indicative of immediate large-scale changes or financial results, leading to moderate expectations for significant stock price movements. Considering the mixed responses from other models and the uncertainties in broader market conditions, a conservative estimate gives a higher probability of stock price rising but acknowledges a potential for slight declines due to cautious reactions from investors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the tension between Trump's push to roll back DEI programs and corporate resistance, specifically mentioning Apple's upcoming shareholder vote on diversity policies. While some may see the rollback as beneficial (citing costs), the article also highlights a Citigroup study showing the massive economic cost of discrimination. The fact that Apple is facing a vote, along with other companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase standing firm on their DEI values, suggests that a significant portion of the market (and potentially Apple's investors) views DEI favorably. Given this context, the market may react positively to Apple's continued support of DEI, mitigating some of the potential negative impact from Trump's initiative. Considering past models' predictions, there's a leaning towards positive, influenced by corporate resistance and potential investor support for DEI.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 earnings exceeding expectations, a positive Wall Street analyst outlook with an 8% average upside potential, the integration of AI in the new iPhone potentially boosting sales, and ChatGPT ranking AAPL as a top stock for long-term growth.  However, several counterpoints exist: the reliance on a potentially unreliable prediction method (ChatGPT); potential downsides such as Trump's planned tariffs and general market uncertainty; and the suggestion within the article that other AI stocks might offer better shorter-term returns.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with several models predicting a higher probability of a price rise (0.6-0.65), and others more cautiously predicting a lower probability or even a slight fall.  Given the strong Q4 results and positive analyst sentiment, I weigh the positive factors more heavily but acknowledge the inherent uncertainties.  The overall market conditions and the reliance on ChatGPT's prediction temper the confidence in a significant price surge. The previous models' predictions show no clear trend that either rises or falls, so I'm keeping the probability closer to the mean of previous models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating, expects strong fiscal Q1 results with revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, and highlights the resilience of Apple's earnings. The Services segment is also performing well with expected growth, and App Store revenue has shown strong demand. Additionally, potential easing of regulatory pressures and the development of an in-house 5G modem could positively impact margins. On the negative side, BofA has trimmed the price target and anticipates weaker Q2 performance with lower iPhone shipments due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Overall, the positive aspects, particularly the strong Q1 expectations and Services growth, seem to outweigh the concerns, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging different fares based on the user's phone model, such as Apple or Android. This news does not directly relate to Apple's business operations, financials, or products. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The neutral nature of the news suggests that the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards no major change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, but highlights corporate resistance to this move, including from companies like Apple (AAPL). The data showing that discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020 implies that DEI programs have economic benefits. Given that companies like Apple are facing shareholder votes on defending diversity policies, it suggests strong support for these programs within the corporate world. This commitment to DEI values may be viewed positively by investors, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. However, considering the previous predictions and the potential uncertainty and mixed reactions to such news, a moderate increase in probability of the stock price rising is expected, while also acknowledging the possibility of a decline due to potential backlash or market volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple\u2019s strategic move of appointing Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri. This appointment indicates a renewed focus on AI and machine learning, addressing recent setbacks in this area. While the move is generally viewed positively, suggesting potential strategic advancements and improvements in a critical domain, the immediate impact on the stock price remains subject to investor perception of its long-term significance. Previous predictions suggest a mix of cautious optimism, with some models predicting rises and others predicting falls. Taking these into account, the news is seen as moderately positive, yet operational changes carry lower probabilities of significantly moving the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning Division indicates the company's commitment to enhancing its capabilities in these critical areas, which could bolster investor confidence. Many models highlight this change as a moderately positive strategic move while acknowledging that the news is operational and may not lead to immediate large-scale impacts. While there is some uncertainty in the market that could lead to a slight decline, the overall interpretation of the news leans more positively due to the emphasis on AI advancement and organizational focus. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price increase and a lower probability of decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on the tension between Trump's initiatives targeting DEI programs and the resistance from corporations, including Apple. While there might be concerns about potential costs associated with DEI programs, data suggests that discrimination has significant economic costs. The fact that Apple is facing a shareholder vote on this issue, alongside the stance of other major companies like Nasdaq and JPMorgan Chase, suggests that a considerable portion of the market supports DEI initiatives. Taking into account previous models' predictions, which show a range of opinions but generally lean slightly positive, I assess a slightly increased probability that Apple's stock price will rise due to its continued commitment to DEI, mitigating potential negative impacts from the political pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  While Q4 results beat expectations and analysts are bullish with an average 8% upside potential, the reliance on a ChatGPT prediction for long-term growth introduces significant uncertainty.  The potential for Trump's tariffs to increase manufacturing costs is a downside.  The previous predictions show a range, with several models predicting a higher probability of a price rise (0.55-0.7), and others predicting a lower probability or even a slight fall (0.05). The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but the presence of significant uncertainties, including the external factors of potential tariffs and the inherent volatility of the stock market, moderates this optimism. The repeated mention of AI improvements and its potential are clearly a positive, but the lack of concrete near-term impact from this news leads to a prediction slightly skewed toward a rise, but with significant room for neutral movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating and expects strong fiscal Q1 results with revenue and iPhone shipments slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates. The Services segment is performing well with expected growth, and App Store revenue has shown strong demand. Additionally, potential easing of regulatory pressures and the development of an in-house 5G modem could positively impact margins. On the negative side, BofA has trimmed the price target and anticipates weaker Q2 performance with lower iPhone shipments due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, and the overall positive aspects outweighing the concerns, the stock price is more likely to rise. However, the trimmed price target and weaker Q2 outlook introduce some uncertainty, leading to a moderate probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article provided does not directly relate to Apple's business operations, financials, or products. It discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging different fares based on the user's phone model. This information is neutral regarding Apple's stock price movement. Given that the news does not directly impact Apple's business or financials, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, considering the overall positive sentiment from previous rounds of predictions and the lack of direct negative impact on Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses President Trump's initiative to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, which may have a negative impact on companies like Apple. However, the article also highlights corporate resistance to this move, including from Apple, and data showing that discrimination has cost the US economy $16 trillion between 2000 and 2020. This implies that DEI programs have economic benefits and may be viewed positively by investors. Considering the previous predictions, there is a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise and others predicting a lower probability or even a slight fall. Taking into account the mixed reactions to such news and the potential uncertainty, a moderate increase in probability of the stock price rising is expected, while also acknowledging the possibility of a decline due to potential backlash or market volatility.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple\u2019s strategic move of appointing Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges and boost Siri.

Previous predictions suggest a mix of cautious optimism, with some models predicting rises and others predicting falls. Taking these into account, the news is seen as moderately positive, yet operational changes carry lower probabilities of significantly moving the stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning Division reflects a strategic move towards enhancing Apple's capabilities in these critical areas, which is likely to bolster investor confidence. The focus on AI aligns with the increasing market importance of these technologies. While the news is operational and may not result in immediate large-scale changes or financial outcomes, the general sentiment from previous models is leaning towards a positive impact. Considering mixed forecasts, uncertainties, and the overall positive outlook on AI advancement, I anticipate a higher probability of the stock price rising, balanced by a lower probability of decrease due to potential market cautiousness.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news focuses on the tension between Trump's initiative to roll back DEI programs and corporate resistance, including Apple. While some argue these programs have costs, data suggests discrimination costs the U.S. economy significantly. Apple faces a shareholder vote on DEI policies, and other major companies are standing firm, suggesting strong market support for DEI. Considering previous models' predictions, which generally lean slightly positive, I estimate a slightly increased probability that Apple's stock price will rise due to its continued commitment to DEI, mitigating potential negative impacts from political pressure. The mixed views in previous predictions support a moderate adjustment. The long-term benefits of DEI are also factored into this calculation.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  Positive factors include strong Q4 2024 earnings exceeding expectations, a positive Wall Street analyst outlook with an average 8% upside potential, the integration of AI in the new iPhone potentially boosting sales, and ChatGPT ranking AAPL as a top stock for long-term growth. This is further supported by the appointment of Kim Vorrath to lead AI and machine learning efforts, indicating Apple's commitment to this important area. However, several counterpoints exist: the reliance on a potentially unreliable prediction method (ChatGPT); potential downsides such as Trump's planned tariffs and general market uncertainty; and the suggestion within the article that other AI stocks might offer better shorter-term returns.  The previous predictions from various models show a range, with a slight tendency towards a higher probability of price rise, but with no clear consensus.  Considering the strong Q4 results and positive analyst sentiment, I weigh the positive factors more heavily. However, the presence of significant uncertainties, including external factors like potential tariffs and the inherent volatility of the stock market, moderates this optimism.  The repeated mention of AI improvements and its potential are clearly positive, but the lack of concrete near-term impact from the AI news leads to a prediction slightly skewed toward a rise, but with significant room for neutral or even slightly downward movement. The overall sentiment across previous rounds leans towards a moderate increase, so I am adjusting my prediction accordingly, taking into account the general cautious optimism.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
