(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with a strong track record in managing complex software projects, to Apple\u2019s AI division suggests a strategic shift towards improving their AI capabilities and addressing shortcomings in Siri. This move may signal to investors that Apple is taking proactive steps to enhance its competitive edge in AI, potentially bolstering investor confidence. However, ongoing challenges with Siri and the AI rollout could dampen immediate optimism. Overall, the news is positive for long-term prospects but might not yield short-term gains due to existing AI performance issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple (AAPL) is reporting earnings next week, which attracts investor attention. Generally, earnings announcements have a high degree of uncertainty and can result in significant stock price movements in either direction depending on whether the company beats, meets, or misses expectations, and whether the guidance is positive, neutral or negative. As such, a 50-50 chance is a reasonable assessment given the limited specific information available. Since this is for a whole week, not just one day, any initial movement toward one direction based on information in this article could be reversed/altered by other companies announcements as well as other global, political, and economic news that may arise during the course of the week. There are also many stocks listed and referenced in this article so the effects each might have are speculative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article mentions Apple's earnings report, it doesn't provide specific information about Apple's expected performance.  The overall tone regarding the tech sector is somewhat mixed, with concerns about the semiconductor industry's demand and the impact of potential policy changes by President Trump. However, these are general market factors and don't directly predict Apple's specific performance.  Given the lack of specific information on Apple's upcoming earnings report within the news, it is difficult to predict a specific change in stock price with high certainty.  A neutral stance is assumed, meaning the probabilities are closer to even, slightly weighted towards a price rise due to the general positive sentiment and long-term growth expectations for the company.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The reassignment of a veteran executive like Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning division signals a strategic focus on enhancing these critical areas. Given Vorrath's proven track record in managing complex products, this move is likely to be perceived positively by investors as it may lead to innovative advancements and competitive edge in AI. This could boost investor confidence and drive the stock price up.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google. This investigation could potentially lead to pro-competition interventions that might require Apple to open up access to its operating systems or app stores to third-party apps. Historically, such regulatory scrutiny has been perceived negatively by investors as it can threaten a company's market dominance and profit margins. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will fall due to the potential negative impact on its business model and competitive position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is taking steps to address its AI challenges by bringing in a seasoned expert, Kim Vorrath, to boost Siri and other AI-related offerings. This move suggests that the company is committed to improving its AI capabilities, which could potentially lead to improved products and services. However, the article also mentions that Apple has faced AI setbacks and is behind its rivals in the AI race. Given this mixed context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, as the appointment of a veteran expert could be seen as a positive step towards addressing the company's AI challenges.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive with a strong track record at Apple, to lead improvements in AI and Siri may signal positive strategic moves for the company. This shift suggests that Apple is recognizing its shortcomings in the AI domain and is taking steps to enhance its capabilities. Investors may perceive this as a proactive approach to bolster its competitive edge against rivals like Google and OpenAI. While concerns about the current performance of Siri and the broader AI initiatives remain, the potential for improvement under Vorrath's leadership is likely to boost investor confidence. Thus, while there are mixed sentiments based on Apple\u2019s historical challenges in AI, the overall outlook can be considered favorable, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: Apple is reporting earnings next week along with other 'Magnificent 7' companies, which will attract investor attention. The article doesn't contain specific information about Apple's expected financial performance, making a definitive prediction difficult. The market's reaction will depend on whether Apple beats, meets, or misses expectations and the guidance provided. Given this uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, influenced by the generally positive long-term outlook for the tech sector, demonstrated by previous predictions with several raising predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a broad overview of several companies' upcoming earnings reports, including Apple's.  It does not offer specific insights into Apple's expected performance.  While some positive sentiment exists around the tech sector (e.g.,  the luxury sector's recent rally, positive Q3 results for some companies), there is also considerable uncertainty (e.g., Trump's potential impact on oil prices and chip exports).  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, not strongly favoring a rise or fall for Apple. Considering this lack of specific information relating directly to Apple's performance, and the mixed signals from the overall market context, a neutral probability distribution is appropriate, with a slight tilt towards a price rise given Apple's generally robust financial performance and long term growth prospects.  The previous predictions' wide range reinforces the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock price prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive with a strong track record, to Apple's AI and Machine Learning division is a strategic move that signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities. Given Vorrath's history of managing complex products, this decision is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it may lead to advancements in AI that could strengthen Apple's competitive position. Historical analysis suggests that such strategic personnel moves are often met with investor optimism, which typically results in a positive stock price movement in the short term. While there are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with AI development, the overall sentiment from this news leans towards optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google. This investigation could potentially lead to pro-competition interventions that might require Apple to open up access to its operating systems or app stores to third-party apps. Historically, such regulatory scrutiny has been perceived negatively by investors as it can threaten a company's market dominance and profit margins. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will fall due to the potential negative impact on its business model and competitive position. However, Apple has a history of navigating regulatory challenges and the company's strong ecosystem and loyal customer base might mitigate some negative impacts. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI division is a strategic move to address the company's AI challenges and boost Siri. This move signals to investors that Apple is taking proactive steps to enhance its competitive edge in AI. Considering the mixed context of Apple's AI setbacks and the positive step of appointing a veteran expert, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. The trend of others' predictions also indicates a general positive sentiment towards Apple's move, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the existence of some negative predictions and the mention of AI setbacks and regulatory scrutiny suggest that there is still some uncertainty and potential downside risk.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. Apple is known for its consistent performance, but the AI division and general market conditions play a role. The mixed opinions from previous predictions indicate both potential positives (AI advancements) and negatives (regulatory investigations). Considering the overall context and the mixed feedback, a balanced view seems appropriate.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The appointment of veteran executive Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and machine learning division suggests that the company is making a concerted effort to address its AI challenges and improve Siri, which has historically lagged behind competitors. This strategic move may boost investor confidence as it signals proactive steps toward enhancing Apple's technological edge in AI. However, there are ongoing concerns about Siri's current performance and potential regulatory scrutiny affecting the company. Balancing the optimism regarding Vorrath's expertise with these concerns leads to a higher probability of price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article focuses on Apple's upcoming earnings report along with those of other tech giants. While the article doesn't offer specific details about Apple's expected performance, the fact that it's one of the 'Magnificent 7' ensures high investor attention. The overall market sentiment seems cautiously optimistic, with some positive news in sectors like luxury goods potentially influencing investor confidence. However, external factors such as political policies (Trump's potential impact on trade and oil prices) and potential regulatory scrutiny add uncertainty. Considering the positive factors and the lack of specific negative news directly concerning Apple in this article, a slight upward trend is expected. Others' predictions from previous rounds show a mixed view with a slight uptick toward stock price rising, which aligns with this more positive outlook. There is no significant change of key context.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a broad overview of several companies' earnings reports, including Apple's, but offers no specific information about Apple's expected performance.  The overall tone is mixed, with positive sentiment in some sectors (luxury) and uncertainty in others (semiconductors, oil due to Trump's comments).  Previous predictions are varied, with no strong consensus on the direction of Apple's stock price.  Apple's earnings announcement carries inherent uncertainty, and the market's reaction will depend on the details. While the appointment of Kim Vorrath to lead AI improvements is a potential positive factor, it's not sufficient to significantly shift the probability away from a neutral outlook given the limited contextual information about Apple's earnings themselves. The prior round's predictions show some convergence toward a slightly higher probability of a price increase for Apple, but this is not definitive. Considering all these factors, I give a slightly higher probability to a price rise reflecting Apple's generally strong financial performance and long-term growth projections and the slight convergence in previous predictions but retain a considerable degree of uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive with a strong track record, to Apple's AI and Machine Learning division is a strategic move that signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities. This is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it may lead to advancements in AI that could strengthen Apple's competitive position. However, the news also mentions ongoing challenges with Siri and the broader AI rollout, which could dampen immediate optimism. Additionally, the mixed predictions from previous rounds indicate both positive sentiment (due to the strategic move) and concerns (due to regulatory scrutiny and AI setbacks). Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but with notable uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into Apple's and Google's mobile ecosystems, specifically their operating systems, app stores, and web browsers on mobile devices. This investigation could potentially lead to pro-competition interventions that might require Apple to open up access to its operating systems or app stores to third-party apps. Historically, such regulatory scrutiny has been perceived negatively by investors as it can threaten a company's market dominance and profit margins. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will fall due to the potential negative impact on its business model and competitive position. However, Apple has a strong ecosystem and loyal customer base that might mitigate some negative impacts.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI division is a strategic move that signals the company's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities. This decision is likely to be viewed positively by investors, given Vorrath's strong track record in managing complex software projects. While Apple has faced AI setbacks and is behind its rivals in the AI race, the trend of others' predictions and the overall sentiment from this news lean towards optimism. However, the existence of some negative predictions and the mention of regulatory scrutiny suggest that there is still some uncertainty and potential downside risk. Considering the mixed context and the trend of previous predictions, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. Apple has shown strategic moves with the appointment of Kim Vorrath to its AI division, indicating efforts to improve its AI capabilities. However, potential regulatory issues from the CMA investigation and mixed predictions from different models contribute to uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals, the recent trend from other models leans towards a slight positive sentiment but acknowledges potential downsides. Therefore, a probability is derived considering these aspects.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The recent news about Kim Vorrath's appointment to Apple's AI division indicates a strategic focus towards enhancing Apple's AI capabilities and addressing the company's challenges with Siri. Given Vorrath's established track record at Apple, this move may boost investor confidence regarding Apple's competitive stance in AI, as it shows proactivity in improving products that have lagged behind competitors. However, there are lingering concerns about Siri's performance and potential regulatory scrutiny that might dampen immediate investor sentiment. Balancing these factors leads to a cautious optimism about Apple's stock, hence a higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.61, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.39, Reasoning: The article focuses on Apple's (AAPL) upcoming earnings report amidst a week dominated by the \"Magnificent 7\" earnings releases. There's no specific financial information about Apple's expected performance in the article, leading to inherent uncertainty. However, the Kim Vorrath AI division appointment, noted in earlier rounds, remains a factor and suggests proactive efforts to improve AI capabilities. Concerns linger about regulatory scrutiny but this article doesn't emphasize it. Previous predictions exhibit mixed sentiment, trending slightly towards optimism. Considering AI-related upsides, and balanced broader market sentiment, this warrants a slightly increased probability for a stock price rise. While regulatory concerns exist, they don't outweigh AI improvements. This, in tandem with the earnings report potential and Magnificent 7 association, tilts the odds in favor of small positive movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a broad overview of several companies' earnings reports, including Apple's, but lacks specific information about Apple's expected performance.  The overall market sentiment is mixed, with positive news in some sectors (luxury) and uncertainty in others (semiconductors, oil due to Trump's comments).  Previous predictions are varied, reflecting this uncertainty. The appointment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI division is potentially positive, signaling proactive steps to enhance AI capabilities, but this alone isn't sufficient to confidently predict a stock price rise.  The overall uncertainty, combined with the lack of specific news about Apple's earnings and the mixed signals from other sectors, leads to a prediction leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Apple's generally robust financial performance, but with considerable uncertainty. The convergence of previous predictions towards a slightly higher probability of a price increase is noted but not heavily weighted; the lack of concrete financial news about Apple is the dominating factor in my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive with a strong track record, to Apple's AI and Machine Learning division is a strategic move that signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities.

The trend of others' predictions shows a mixed view with a slight inclination towards a positive sentiment due to strategic moves like the appointment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI division. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than falling, reflecting the potential negative impact of regulatory scrutiny on Apple's business model.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.59, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.41, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a seasoned veteran with 36 years of experience at Apple, to the company's AI and machine learning division is a strategic move that signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities. This move is likely to be viewed positively by investors, given Vorrath's strong track record in managing complex software projects. While Apple has faced AI setbacks and is behind its rivals in the AI race, the trend of others' predictions and the overall sentiment from this news lean towards optimism.
