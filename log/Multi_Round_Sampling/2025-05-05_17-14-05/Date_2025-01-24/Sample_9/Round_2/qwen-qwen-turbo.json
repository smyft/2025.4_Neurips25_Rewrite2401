(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stocks to watch next week: ASML, Intel, LVMH, Shell and Glencore\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as five of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nTesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will be releasing results next week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML, as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nRead more: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH's results can add to optimism.\n\nShell's latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by newly reinstated US president Donald Trump on lowering prices.\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore, which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nASML (ASML.AS) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter and full-year results on Wednesday 29 January\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early, which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nSince October's results release, ASML stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML.AS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

This move may signal to investors that Apple is taking proactive steps to enhance its competitive edge in AI, potentially bolstering investor confidence. However, ongoing challenges with Siri and the AI rollout could dampen immediate optimism. Overall, the news is positive for long-term prospects but might not yield short-term gains due to existing AI performance issues.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: Apple (AAPL) is reporting earnings next week, which attracts investor attention. Generally, earnings announcements have a high degree of uncertainty and can result in significant stock price movements in either direction depending on whether the company beats, meets, or misses expectations, and whether the guidance is positive, neutral or negative. As such, a 50-50 chance is a reasonable assessment given the limited specific information available. Since this is for a whole week, not just one day, any initial movement toward one direction based on information in this article could be reversed/altered by other companies announcements as well as other global, political, and economic news that may arise during the course of the week. There are also many stocks listed and referenced in this article so the effects each might have are speculative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on several companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. While the article mentions Apple's earnings report, it doesn't provide specific information about Apple's expected performance.  The overall tone regarding the tech sector is somewhat mixed, with concerns about the semiconductor industry's demand and the impact of potential policy changes by President Trump. However, these are general market factors and don't directly predict Apple's specific performance.  Given the lack of specific information on Apple's upcoming earnings report within the news, it is difficult to predict a specific change in stock price with high certainty.  A neutral stance is assumed, meaning the probabilities are closer to even, slightly weighted towards a price rise due to the general positive sentiment and long-term growth expectations for the company.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The reassignment of a veteran executive like Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI and Machine Learning division signals a strategic focus on enhancing these critical areas. Given Vorrath's proven track record in managing complex products, this move is likely to be perceived positively by investors as it may lead to innovative advancements and competitive edge in AI. This could boost investor confidence and drive the stock price up.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google. This investigation could potentially lead to pro-competition interventions that might require Apple to open up access to its operating systems or app stores to third-party apps. Historically, such regulatory scrutiny has been perceived negatively by investors as it can threaten a company's market dominance and profit margins. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will fall due to the potential negative impact on its business model and competitive position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is taking steps to address its AI challenges by bringing in a seasoned expert, Kim Vorrath, to boost Siri and other AI-related offerings. This move suggests that the company is committed to improving its AI capabilities, which could potentially lead to improved products and services. However, the article also mentions that Apple has faced AI setbacks and is behind its rivals in the AI race. Given this mixed context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, as the appointment of a veteran expert could be seen as a positive step towards addressing the company's AI challenges.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive with a strong track record at Apple, to lead improvements in AI and Siri may signal positive strategic moves for the company. This shift suggests that Apple is recognizing its shortcomings in the AI domain and is taking steps to enhance its capabilities. Investors may perceive this as a proactive approach to bolster its competitive edge against rivals like Google and OpenAI. While concerns about the current performance of Siri and the broader AI initiatives remain, the potential for improvement under Vorrath's leadership is likely to boost investor confidence. Thus, while there are mixed sentiments based on Apple\u2019s historical challenges in AI, the overall outlook can be considered favorable, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: Apple is reporting earnings next week along with other 'Magnificent 7' companies, which will attract investor attention. The article doesn't contain specific information about Apple's expected financial performance, making a definitive prediction difficult. The market's reaction will depend on whether Apple beats, meets, or misses expectations and the guidance provided. Given this uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, influenced by the generally positive long-term outlook for the tech sector, demonstrated by previous predictions with several raising predictions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article provides a broad overview of several companies' upcoming earnings reports, including Apple's.  It does not offer specific insights into Apple's expected performance.  While some positive sentiment exists around the tech sector (e.g.,  the luxury sector's recent rally, positive Q3 results for some companies), there is also considerable uncertainty (e.g., Trump's potential impact on oil prices and chip exports).  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, not strongly favoring a rise or fall for Apple. Considering this lack of specific information relating directly to Apple's performance, and the mixed signals from the overall market context, a neutral probability distribution is appropriate, with a slight tilt towards a price rise given Apple's generally robust financial performance and long term growth prospects.  The previous predictions' wide range reinforces the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock price prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The reassignment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive with a strong track record, to Apple's AI and Machine Learning division is a strategic move that signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI capabilities. Given Vorrath's history of managing complex products, this decision is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as it may lead to advancements in AI that could strengthen Apple's competitive position. Historical analysis suggests that such strategic personnel moves are often met with investor optimism, which typically results in a positive stock price movement in the short term. While there are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with AI development, the overall sentiment from this news leans towards optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google. This investigation could potentially lead to pro-competition interventions that might require Apple to open up access to its operating systems or app stores to third-party apps. Historically, such regulatory scrutiny has been perceived negatively by investors as it can threaten a company's market dominance and profit margins. Given this context, there is a higher likelihood that Apple's stock price will fall due to the potential negative impact on its business model and competitive position. However, Apple has a history of navigating regulatory challenges and the company's strong ecosystem and loyal customer base might mitigate some negative impacts. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to Apple's AI division is a strategic move to address the company's AI challenges and boost Siri. This move signals to investors that Apple is taking proactive steps to enhance its competitive edge in AI. Considering the mixed context of Apple's AI setbacks and the positive step of appointing a veteran expert, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. The trend of others' predictions also indicates a general positive sentiment towards Apple's move, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the existence of some negative predictions and the mention of AI setbacks and regulatory scrutiny suggest that there is still some uncertainty and potential downside risk.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple companies reporting earnings next week, including Apple. Apple is known for its consistent performance, but the AI division and general market conditions play a role. The mixed opinions from previous predictions indicate both potential positives (AI advancements) and negatives (regulatory investigations). Considering the overall context and the mixed feedback, a balanced view seems appropriate.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
