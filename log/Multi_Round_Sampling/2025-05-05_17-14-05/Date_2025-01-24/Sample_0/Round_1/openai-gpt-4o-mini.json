(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, with analysts suggesting that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI investments. Dan Ives specifically highlights that Meta and other tech companies are on the verge of a significant transformation, creating a favorable outlook for Apple and its peers. The mention of 'massive build-out' in AI spending suggests overall bullishness in the sector. Since Apple is included in the Big Tech earnings report and the broader positive sentiment may spill over to its stock, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in tech stocks towards the end of the trading day. While it doesn't specifically mention Apple, the statement that the 'Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)' is in the red suggests a broad-based negative sentiment affecting the technology sector, which typically includes Apple. Given that the news highlights a negative trend, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is likely higher than that of rising. However, Apple is a strong company with significant reserves of investor confidence, causing us to assign a lower probability of a significant fall as most investors will consider this a temporary setback.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's efforts to improve its AI capabilities and Siri, areas where it has lagged behind competitors.  Apple's hiring of a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products suggests a serious commitment to addressing these shortcomings. While this is a positive development, the impact on stock price is likely to be muted.  The article highlights ongoing challenges with Siri and recent setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. These negative factors temper the optimism generated by the new hire. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic; it\u2019s a step in the right direction, but investors may not react dramatically until concrete improvements in AI and Siri are demonstrated. The move is more of a long-term strategic play rather than an immediate catalyst for significant price changes. Therefore, the probabilities lean slightly toward a price rise, reflecting the positive initiative, but a significant move in either direction is unlikely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches (like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem) are highlighted. BofA remains bullish on the stock despite lowering its price target slightly from $256 to $253. However, there are concerns about weaker iPhone sales in the March quarter and for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, attributed to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. The news also mentions that concerns about weak iPhone sales in China may be overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. Overall, the positive aspects (strong Q1 earnings, bullish sentiment, and potential catalysts) seem to outweigh the negatives (lowered sales forecasts and near-term weakness), suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has appointed a veteran software executive, Kim Vorrath, to help fix its artificial intelligence (AI) and Siri digital assistant. Vorrath has 36 years of experience at Apple and a proven track record of managing complex software projects and fixing troubled products. Her appointment aims to bolster Apple's AI team, which has struggled to match the capabilities of its technology peers. The company is racing to make AI a leader, and Vorrath's expertise in program management and bringing major projects to market could help address Apple's shortcomings in AI. However, the challenges in AI and Siri's development are significant, and it may take time for these efforts to translate into tangible results. Given the importance of AI in Apple's ecosystem and the potential for improved Siri functionality, this news could be perceived positively by investors. Nevertheless, the actual impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the successful implementation of AI features, the reception of new products, and competition in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.'s stock has been experiencing significant declines, approaching a critical technical level known as the 200-day moving average. Analysts and experts believe that breaching this level could indicate further downside. Moreover, Apple's poor performance relative to the broader market and the recent trend suggests increased risk of continued falls. However, there remains a possibility that if Apple reports positive earnings, it could potentially reverse the downward momentum.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
