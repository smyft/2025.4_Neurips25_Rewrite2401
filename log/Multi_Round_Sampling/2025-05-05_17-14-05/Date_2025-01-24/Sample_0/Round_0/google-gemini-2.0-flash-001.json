While it doesn't specifically mention Apple, the statement that the 'Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)' is in the red suggests a broad-based negative sentiment affecting the technology sector, which typically includes Apple. Given that the news highlights a negative trend, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is likely higher than that of rising. However, Apple is a strong company with significant reserves of investor confidence, causing us to assign a lower probability of a significant fall as most investors will consider this a temporary setback.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Sector Update: Tech Stocks Fall Late Afternoon\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.30,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.70\n}\n```"
