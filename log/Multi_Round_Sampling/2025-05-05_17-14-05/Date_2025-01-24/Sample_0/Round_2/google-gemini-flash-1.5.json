(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive sentiment around Big Tech earnings, with analysts suggesting that Wall Street is underestimating the impact of AI investments. Dan Ives specifically highlights that Meta and other tech companies are on the verge of a significant transformation, creating a favorable outlook for Apple and its peers. The mention of 'massive build-out' in AI spending suggests overall bullishness in the sector. Since Apple is included in the Big Tech earnings report and the broader positive sentiment may spill over to its stock, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general downturn in tech stocks towards the end of the trading day. While it doesn't specifically mention Apple, the statement that the 'Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)' is in the red suggests a broad-based negative sentiment affecting the technology sector, which typically includes Apple. Given that the news highlights a negative trend, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is likely higher than that of rising. However, Apple is a strong company with significant reserves of investor confidence, causing us to assign a lower probability of a significant fall as most investors will consider this a temporary setback.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's efforts to improve its AI capabilities and Siri, areas where it has lagged behind competitors.  Apple's hiring of a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products suggests a serious commitment to addressing these shortcomings. While this is a positive development, the impact on stock price is likely to be muted.  The article highlights ongoing challenges with Siri and recent setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. These negative factors temper the optimism generated by the new hire. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic; it\u2019s a step in the right direction, but investors may not react dramatically until concrete improvements in AI and Siri are demonstrated. The move is more of a long-term strategic play rather than an immediate catalyst for significant price changes. Therefore, the probabilities lean slightly toward a price rise, reflecting the positive initiative, but a significant move in either direction is unlikely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Q1 earnings are expected to beat estimates, and the company's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential new product launches (like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem) are highlighted. BofA remains bullish on the stock despite lowering its price target slightly from $256 to $253. However, there are concerns about weaker iPhone sales in the March quarter and for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, attributed to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. The news also mentions that concerns about weak iPhone sales in China may be overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. Overall, the positive aspects (strong Q1 earnings, bullish sentiment, and potential catalysts) seem to outweigh the negatives (lowered sales forecasts and near-term weakness), suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. has appointed a veteran software executive, Kim Vorrath, to help fix its artificial intelligence (AI) and Siri digital assistant. Vorrath has 36 years of experience at Apple and a proven track record of managing complex software projects and fixing troubled products. Her appointment aims to bolster Apple's AI team, which has struggled to match the capabilities of its technology peers. The company is racing to make AI a leader, and Vorrath's expertise in program management and bringing major projects to market could help address Apple's shortcomings in AI. However, the challenges in AI and Siri's development are significant, and it may take time for these efforts to translate into tangible results. Given the importance of AI in Apple's ecosystem and the potential for improved Siri functionality, this news could be perceived positively by investors. Nevertheless, the actual impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the successful implementation of AI features, the reception of new products, and competition in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Invalid JSON\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.'s stock has been experiencing significant declines, approaching a critical technical level known as the 200-day moving average. Analysts and experts believe that breaching this level could indicate further downside. Moreover, Apple's poor performance relative to the broader market and the recent trend suggests increased risk of continued falls. However, there remains a possibility that if Apple reports positive earnings, it could potentially reverse the downward momentum.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings and expresses a generally positive outlook, especially regarding extensive AI investments which could benefit Apple as it is a significant player in the tech sector. While some analysts show concern about the short-term challenges Apple faces, the prevailing sentiment around the transformation in tech, especially with the emphasis on AI capabilities, supports a cautiously optimistic view for Apple. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, but the overall trend leans toward positive expectations due to the broader bullish context of Big Tech earnings. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising based on the positive narratives surrounding AI investments and potential earnings beats, combined with a more tempered view on negative impacts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Tech Stocks Fall Late Afternoon\" signals a negative trend in the technology sector, which would likely include Apple (AAPL). While it's a broad statement and doesn't provide specific details about the magnitude of the fall or Apple's individual performance, the fact that the sector is 'in the red' suggests a general downturn. Given Apple's significance in the tech sector, it's likely to be affected, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall. However, considering Apple's fundamental strength and market position, the fall might not be drastic. Looking back at previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, indicating that some models have weighed in positive factors. After balancing all the factors, I predict that the stock is more likely to fall, but not drastically. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple appointing a veteran executive to improve AI and Siri is a positive development, signaling a renewed focus on a crucial area where Apple has lagged.  However, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate and not immediate.  While the move addresses a known weakness, it's a long-term strategic play.  The article also highlights ongoing challenges and past setbacks, tempering any immediate bullish sentiment. The previous predictions show a divergence of opinions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others pointing towards a fall, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news's impact.  Considering this uncertainty and the long-term nature of the initiative, I'm assigning a higher probability to a relatively small price increase, rather than a significant jump, or a notable decrease.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

This investigation may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential changes to Apple's business practices, which could negatively impact the company's stock price. However, Apple is a strong company with a history of adapting to regulatory changes, and the investigation's outcome is uncertain. Considering the previous predictions, some models have assigned a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive sentiments around Big Tech earnings and Apple's efforts to improve its AI capabilities, while others have assigned a higher probability of the stock price falling due to negative trends in the technology sector and concerns about weaker iPhone sales. Taking into account the mixed outlook and the potential risks associated with the investigation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's declining stock price and its approach to the 200-day moving average, which often acts as a support or resistance level. Analysts and experts believe that breaching this level could indicate further downside. Moreover, Apple's poor performance relative to the broader market and the recent trend suggests increased risk of continued falls. Previous predictions show a mix of bearish and somewhat bullish sentiments, influenced by different factors such as upcoming earnings reports and AI developments. Considering the current negative momentum and the psychological significance of the 200-day moving average, the probability of a further decline seems higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
