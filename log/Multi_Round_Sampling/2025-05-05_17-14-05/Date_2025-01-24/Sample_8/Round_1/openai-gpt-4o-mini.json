A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news discusses various stocks, including Apple Inc., in the context of market performance and stock rankings. Apple's decline of 11.3% year-to-date and its Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggest bearish sentiment. Despite its significant role in the market and previous appreciation of 15.4% over the last year, the current overall stance is negative, which may lead to further declines or resistance to recovery. Therefore, the combination of a sell rating and historical context indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential regulatory hurdle for Apple in the UK due to an investigation by the CMA. This investigation focuses on Apple's mobile ecosystem dominance and could lead to pro-competition interventions, potentially forcing Apple to open up its ecosystem to third-party apps and services. This could reduce Apple's control and potentially impact its revenue streams and profitability in the UK market. While Apple states it will engage constructively, regulatory investigations can be costly and the outcome is uncertain. The CMA's increased focus on promoting competition likely creates a headwind for AAPL. The change in leadership at the CMA is unlikely to change the decision to investigate, especially given the Labour government's emphasis on prioritizing supporting growth while considering regulatory responsibilities. Thus, this news slightly increases the probability of a stock price decline. Also note, the news mentions Google, another company who could also face adverse impacts, suggesting potential for industry wide changes rather than just impacting Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and overall macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro headset and the company's broader innovation roadmap will be crucial factors influencing investor sentiment. The potential for share buybacks could offer some support.  Given the current 14% drop from the 2024 high and the overall cautious tone, the probability of a price increase is lower than a price decrease, although a significant drop is also not guaranteed. The overall market conditions also add to the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, known for fixing troubled products and managing major projects. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its lag in AI compared to peers like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The market may view this positively as a step towards improving Apple's competitive position in AI, which is a critical growth area. However, the news also mentions ongoing challenges, such as the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. Overall, the positive sentiment of proactive leadership and potential long-term benefits likely outweighs the short-term negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging Apple users higher fares than Android users. This news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or services. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is expected to post strong Q1 earnings, but faces challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite this, BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted slightly downward from $256 to $253, but this still suggests a positive outlook. Given the mixed information, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the strong Q1 earnings and positive analyst outlook are likely to have a more significant impact on investor sentiment than the anticipated decline in iPhone sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a decline in iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings. Despite strong overall earnings, the stock is pressured by negative market sentiments and poor performance in key markets. This suggests a more cautious market attitude towards Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
