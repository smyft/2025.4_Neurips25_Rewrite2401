(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\nNews Content: The latest earnings season has gotten off to a strong start, with investor attention turning to the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants to see if their results can add to this momentum.\n\nThe major tech stocks led market gains in 2024 and the question for investors now is whether they can continue to do so in 2025.\n\nMore specifically, the Magnificent 7 \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia \u2014 were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) 25% return in 2024.\n\nTech stocks were already poised to climb higher this year, with Donald Trump's return to the White House, given his pledges to loosen regulations and cut taxes, as well as to invest heavily in AI.\n\nBillionaire tech CEOs have also been flocking to forge closer ties with Trump, with many in attendance at his inauguration.\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nIn the first few days of Trump's second presidential term tech stocks rallied, after he unveiled a $500bn (\u00a3405bn) private-sector investment plan \u2014 known as the \"Stargate\" project \u2014 to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nIn a note on Wednesday, John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Trump\u2019s ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for AI in the early days of his second presidency, and supports our long-standing view that the S&P 500 will thrive in 2025 amid growing investment in, and enthusiasm for, this transformative technology.\"\n\nGiven this theme is set to continue to dominate markets this year, investors will be watching to see which of the Mag 7 stocks are leading the way on the AI trend, or if any are falling behind.\n\nHere's what experts expect to see from the Mag 7 this earnings season.\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nShares in electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla have surged since Trump's election victory in November, with the stock becoming known as part of the \"Trump trade\", as CEO Elon Musk has become a close ally of the president.\n\nMusk, who was a major supporter of Trump campaign, was appointed to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe rally in Tesla shares comes despite the company reporting an annual delivery decline in early January for the first time in more than a decade. Tesla delivered 1.78 million vehicles in 2024, which was below analyst estimates of 1.8 million.\n\nTesla shares fell following the release of these figures and while Musk's expected role of influence on the incoming Trump administration saw the stock rise ahead of the inauguration, it fell back on the first full day of trading after the Republican president returned to office.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThis came after Trump revoked a policy that mandated half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030 and directed his administration to consider eliminating \"unfair subsidies\" on EVs.\n\nMusk had said last year that he didn't think Tesla would be as impacted as competitors by the scrapping of subsidies and believed it could even help the company in the long term.\n\nDespite these headwinds, analysts remain confident about the stock. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said he believed that Tesla would shift away from launching new EVs and focus on \"popularising\" its autonomous driving software, changing his price target on the stock to $500 from $315.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Tesla posted third quarter revenue of $25.18bn, which was below estimates of $25.4bn. However, adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 came in ahead of an anticipated $0.60, and Tesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\n\nAs for Tesla outlook, the company said in its quarterly earnings deck that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, \"remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025\".\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(TSLA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMeta (META) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-owner Meta, is another tech leader that has been trying to build a closer relationship with Trump.\n\nMeta committed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund and recently announced it had appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, an ally of Trump, as one of three new board members.\n\nZuckerberg also recently announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking programme in the US, a move that was considered as part of a repositioning ahead of Trump's return to office.\n\nMeta shares are up 62% over the past year, though the stock fell following the release of its third quarter earnings in October.\n\nThe company delivered earnings per share of $6.03, which bested estimates of $5.25 and revenue of $40.5bn beat forecasts of $40.2bn.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nHowever, expectations were high going into this set of results and Meta guided to fourth quarter revenue guidance of between $45bn and $48bn for the quarter, compared to analyst forecasts of $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has set itself apart among tech giants by turning AI investments into quick wins. Unlike cloud providers that sell AI capabilities, Meta focuses its efforts on enhancing its own products, driving higher ad revenue.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not to say the AI push comes cheap,\" he added. \"Zuckerberg sees AI as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the spending reflects that ambition. Investment will be watched closely, with some $15bn needed to be spent over the quarter to achieve full-year spending plans.\n\n\"Investors, understandably cautious after Meta\u2019s past overspending on projects like the metaverse, will be laser-focused on investment plans for 2025.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nAs the Stargate project was unveiled, Microsoft said it signed a new agreement with OpenAI, which included \"changes to the exclusivity on new capacity\".\n\nMicrosoft has been OpenAI's biggest backer and has provided data centre infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker to run its language models.\n\nWhile this new agreement marks a shift in the arrangement between the two companies, Microsoft was still named as one of the key initial technology partners on Stargate.\n\nThe company also recently said it planned to spend $80bn on AI in this fiscal year. Microsoft has also been among the tech companies to jump into the trend of digital agents powered by AI.\n\nIn October, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks.\n\nFuturum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance in December that he projected AI agents represent a $4tn annual global market opportunity over the next five years, describing it as \"a massive opportunity\" for companies.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\nIn terms of broader company performance, Microsoft's fiscal first quarter results beat expectations. The company reported earnings per share of $3.30, versus forecasts of $3.10 and revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\n\nHowever, market reaction was downbeat, given mixed guidance on the earnings call. There were concerns around pressure on company profit margins in second quarter given the ramp up in AI spending.\n\nShares have had a bumpy ride over the past year, capping gains at nearly 12%.\n\nBritzman said that the key metric to watch in the second quarter results was growth in its cloud computing Azure business, which is expected to come in at 31% to 32%.\n\n\"Microsoft has said more recently that its capacity constraints are resolved, so markets hope to get a better picture of current demand levels in the coming quarters,\" he said. \"Beyond Azure, the rollout of Copilot will also be under scrutiny, with investors eager to see how product development and adoption are progressing after some criticism from peers.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MSFT)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nApple (AAPL) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in Apple have come under pressure recently, amid disappointing news around its iPhone market share.\n\nApple's stock has suffered two analyst rating downgrades this week alone. Jefferies (JEF) analyst Edison Lee lowered the investment bank's rating on Apple shares to \"underperform\" and decreased his price target on the stock by 13% to $200.75.\n\nLee said in an investor note that he expected Apple's first quarter results \u2014 which are due out next week \u2014 to come in below expectations, and for the company to miss against estimates for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded Apple from \"buy\" to \"hold\" and lowered its price target on the stock from $275 to $230.\n\nMeanwhile, Counterpoint Research found sales of Apple's iPhones fell 18.2% in China in the December quarter, according to a Bloomberg report. The research also showed that the iPhone gave up its title of the top selling smartphone handsets in China to Huawei Technologies.\n\nRead more: Funds for investors to watch in 2025\n\nAnd data from from market analyst firm Canalys showed that Apple lost its top spot as the smartphone maker with the biggest market share in mainland China.\n\nThe recent fall in the Apple's shares, has seen the company's market valuation down decline to $3.41tn, and chipmaker Nvidia overtake it once again as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.55tn.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $0.97 on revenue on revenue of $94.9bn. The company said it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay \u20ac13bn to Ireland for back taxes.\n\nWithout the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nA major focus for Amazon's fourth quarter results next week will be its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nRevenue for this part of the business came in at $27.5bn in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, but was still up 19% year-on-year.\n\nShares popped following the release of Amazon's third quarter results, as it posted earnings per share of $1.43, which was ahead of estimates of $1.16. Revenue of $158.9bn also beat expectations of $157.29bn.\n\nInvestors also cheered Amazon's guidance for the fourth quarter, with the company expecting net sales to come in at between $181.5bn and $188.5bn.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nAmazon is expecting to report operating income of between $16bn and $20bn, against the $13.2bn it reported for the same period in 2023.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Briztman said: \"As usual, AWS will be the cloud hanging over market sentiment \u2014 any growth materially above 19% should get a warm reception. Investors will also be tuned in for updates on AWS\u2019s AI initiatives and the eye-popping investment Amazon plans to spend in the space.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, let\u2019s not forget Amazon\u2019s trusty old e-commerce arm, often overshadowed by its cloud cousin,\" he added. \"For the first time in a while, it\u2019s showing signs of life, with fresh initiatives like the discount storefront \u2018Amazon Haul\u2019 helping expand its reach. If Amazon can fine-tune automation, there\u2019s potential for some tasty margin expansion too.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) \u2014 reports on Tuesday 4 February\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google-owner Alphabet, was another tech leader in attendance at Trump's inauguration.\n\nA day later, Business Insider reported that Alphabet's chief investment officer Ruth Porat said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that there's a \"tremendous amount of opportunity\" to work with Trump in his second term.\n\nThese comments come after Alphabet has been grappling with regulatory headwinds over the past year. In November, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) asked that Google be forced to sell off its Chrome browser, as part of proposed remedies aimed at ending the company's dominance in internet search.\n\nThis filing came after a judge ruled in favour of prosecutors in a landmark trial in August, who argued that that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly. The judge will will now decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that is expected to start this year.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch in European luxury and retail in 2025, according to Deutsche Bank\n\nWhen Trump was asked in an interview in October about whether he believed Google should be broken up, he said: \"Google\u2019s got a lot of power. They\u2019re very bad to me.\"\n\nWhile Trump didn't go into specifics when asked if he would break up the business, he said: \"I\u2019d do something.\"\n\nDespite regulatory concerns, Alphabet has continued to show strong performance, with the company smashing estimates in its third quarter results. Alphabet posted earnings per share of $2.12, compared to expectations of $1.83 and revenue of $88.27bn came in well ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\n\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, Britzman said that having \"arrived fashionably late to the AI party, Alphabet is now making a splash. AI-powered overviews in Google search are starting to show their value, and investors will be laser-focused on ad revenue, still the core growth driver with a 9.5% uplift expected from [the] fourth-quarter results.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GOOGL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 26 February\n\nMarket darling Nvidia will be the last of the Mag 7 to report, with investors eagerly anticipating the earnings for signals on the strength of AI chip demand.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang was one of the few tech execs not to attend Trump's inauguration, though the company was another named as a key initial technology partners on the Stargate project.\n\nShares in Nvidia are up a whopping 145% over the past year, though increasingly high expectations mean markets have become highly sensitive to any disappointing news around the chipmaker.\n\nRead more: Surprising UK pay growth could delay Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cuts\n\nThe stock dipped following the release of its third quarter results, even though Nvidia beat estimates on key metrics. Revenue of $35.1bn was comfortably ahead of analysts estimates of $33.2bn and earnings per share came in at $0.81 beat expectations of $0.74.\n\nHowever, gross margins were lower quarter-on-quarter from 75.1% to 74.6%.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia guided to revenue of $37.5bn for the fourth quarter, plus or minus 2%, which would be just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37bn.\n\nEven so, analysts remain bullish on Nvidia, with Barclays (BARC.L) keeping an \"overweight\" rating on the stock and raising its price target on the stock from $160 to $175.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news discusses various stocks, including Apple Inc., in the context of market performance and stock rankings. Apple's decline of 11.3% year-to-date and its Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggest bearish sentiment. Despite its significant role in the market and previous appreciation of 15.4% over the last year, the current overall stance is negative, which may lead to further declines or resistance to recovery. Therefore, the combination of a sell rating and historical context indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential regulatory hurdle for Apple in the UK due to an investigation by the CMA. This investigation focuses on Apple's mobile ecosystem dominance and could lead to pro-competition interventions, potentially forcing Apple to open up its ecosystem to third-party apps and services. This could reduce Apple's control and potentially impact its revenue streams and profitability in the UK market. While Apple states it will engage constructively, regulatory investigations can be costly and the outcome is uncertain. The CMA's increased focus on promoting competition likely creates a headwind for AAPL. The change in leadership at the CMA is unlikely to change the decision to investigate, especially given the Labour government's emphasis on prioritizing supporting growth while considering regulatory responsibilities. Thus, this news slightly increases the probability of a stock price decline. Also note, the news mentions Google, another company who could also face adverse impacts, suggesting potential for industry wide changes rather than just impacting Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and overall macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro headset and the company's broader innovation roadmap will be crucial factors influencing investor sentiment. The potential for share buybacks could offer some support.  Given the current 14% drop from the 2024 high and the overall cautious tone, the probability of a price increase is lower than a price decrease, although a significant drop is also not guaranteed. The overall market conditions also add to the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, known for fixing troubled products and managing major projects. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its lag in AI compared to peers like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The market may view this positively as a step towards improving Apple's competitive position in AI, which is a critical growth area. However, the news also mentions ongoing challenges, such as the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. Overall, the positive sentiment of proactive leadership and potential long-term benefits likely outweighs the short-term negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging Apple users higher fares than Android users. This news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or services. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is expected to post strong Q1 earnings, but faces challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite this, BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted slightly downward from $256 to $253, but this still suggests a positive outlook. Given the mixed information, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the strong Q1 earnings and positive analyst outlook are likely to have a more significant impact on investor sentiment than the anticipated decline in iPhone sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a decline in iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings. Despite strong overall earnings, the stock is pressured by negative market sentiments and poor performance in key markets. This suggests a more cautious market attitude towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant role in the market and includes a summary of its stock performance. With a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), there is a prevailing bearish sentiment towards the stock. Although Apple is considered a long-term strong player, its high P/E ratio and ongoing challenges suggest that short-term market movements might lean towards further declines. Furthermore, similar recent predictions have suggested a higher probability of stock price falling due to market conditions and competitive pressures. Therefore, combining the historical performance, market sentiment, and the current rating, I estimate a higher probability of price decline compared to the likelihood of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of the UK's competition watchdog investigating Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Regulatory scrutiny and the potential for forced changes to its business practices, such as opening up its operating system and app store to third parties, can reduce Apple's control and profitability. The investigation creates uncertainty, which the market usually reacts negatively to. The fact that other models predicted a higher chance of stock price falling previously further support this. Compared to previous round, while CMA chief executive's words support market competition which would 'boost growth', the new Amazon UK Doug Gurr's replacement of chairman suggests that there is more inclination of supporting growth and supporting market competition. Therefore, the negative impacts brought by regulatory scrutiny still outweigh the potential growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower services segment growth due to regulatory pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainty.  The Vision Pro's success is crucial. Share buybacks could offer support. The 14% drop from the 2024 high and overall cautious tone suggest a higher probability of a price decrease. However, the positive EPS and revenue growth projections counterbalance this.  Previous predictions show a wide range, indicating considerable uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly bearish, but not overwhelmingly so. Considering all factors, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the existing negative sentiment and potential challenges, but acknowledging the possibility of a positive reaction to the earnings report if it surpasses expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its lag in AI compared to peers like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The market may view this positively as a step towards improving Apple's competitive position in AI, which is a critical growth area. However, the news also mentions ongoing challenges, such as the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. The previous predictions show a mix of sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to broader market concerns, while others see potential in Apple's proactive measures. Considering the positive aspects of leadership change and long-term AI strategy, but balancing it with short-term challenges and mixed analyst sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging Apple users higher fares than Android users. This news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or services. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low, with a slight bias towards the stock price remaining stable or rising due to the overall market trend and previous predictions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with strong Q1 earnings expected but challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted slightly downward from $256 to $253, but this still suggests a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of increasingly positive sentiment towards Apple's stock, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the overall market conditions and the decline in iPhone sales in China are still concerns. Taking into account the strong Q1 earnings and positive analyst outlook, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a decline in iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings. Despite strong overall earnings, the stock is pressured by negative market sentiments and poor performance in key markets. The news also mentions regulatory concerns and challenges in the AI domain. While there are positive sentiments regarding the company's efforts in AI and strategic moves, the current trends and analyst sentiments weigh heavier towards a negative outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), reflecting both current challenges and potential future opportunities. While the year-to-date decline of 11.3% and the Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) indicate bearish sentiment, the Macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory pressures add to concerns regarding the iPhone and services revenue. However, the company's strategic focus on AI and positive analyst forecasts for Q1 earnings suggest some resilience. The divergence in predictions from various models demonstrates uncertainty, with many leaning towards a bearish sentiment, particularly due to regulatory scrutiny and declining market share. Overall, this leads to a higher probability of stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The UK's investigation into Apple's mobile ecosystem poses a significant regulatory risk. The CMA's ability to impose conduct requirements, potentially forcing Apple to open its platform to third parties, could negatively impact Apple's control and profitability. The investigation itself creates uncertainty, which markets dislike. While Apple states it will engage constructively, the potential for mandated changes to its business model outweighs any positive spin. Considering that the previous rounds show a dominant trend of estimating the stock price to fall, I will integrate and further enforce the falling prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, significant concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment (due to regulatory pressures), and the overall macroeconomic climate. The success of the Vision Pro headset is crucial for future growth. Share buybacks might offer some support, but the 14% drop from the 2024 high and the generally cautious tone suggest a bearish bias.  Analysis of previous predictions shows a trend toward a slightly more positive outlook in the second round, however, the consistent presence of negative factors like slowing iPhone sales and regulatory pressures keeps the overall sentiment leaning bearish. The expected 3% YoY revenue increase and EPS rise are positive, but not strong enough to overcome the other headwinds.  The uncertainty surrounding the Vision Pro and general market conditions add to the complexity. Considering all factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, reflecting the existing negative sentiment and potential challenges but acknowledging the possibility of a positive reaction to the earnings report if it significantly exceeds expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products.

The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple's core business and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low, with a slight bias towards stability. However, given the overall market conditions and previous predictions that suggest a cautious outlook, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with strong Q1 earnings expected but challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features.

Taking into account the strong Q1 earnings and positive analyst outlook, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple tech companies and provides a mixed outlook for the Magnificent 7, with particular focus on regulatory and competitive pressures on companies like Apple. While Apple continues to face challenges such as declining iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings, it also shows positive signs like its commitment to AI through strategic moves. Previous predictions have shown a trend of mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to market concerns, while others remain cautiously optimistic. The probability of the stock price rising is slightly supported by positive sentiments regarding company efforts and analyst outlook, but these probabilities need to balance with the existing market challenges.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
