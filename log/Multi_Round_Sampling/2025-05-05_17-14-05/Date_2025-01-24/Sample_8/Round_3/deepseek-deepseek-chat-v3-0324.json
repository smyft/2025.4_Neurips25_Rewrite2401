(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news discusses various stocks, including Apple Inc., in the context of market performance and stock rankings. Apple's decline of 11.3% year-to-date and its Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) suggest bearish sentiment. Despite its significant role in the market and previous appreciation of 15.4% over the last year, the current overall stance is negative, which may lead to further declines or resistance to recovery. Therefore, the combination of a sell rating and historical context indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a potential regulatory hurdle for Apple in the UK due to an investigation by the CMA. This investigation focuses on Apple's mobile ecosystem dominance and could lead to pro-competition interventions, potentially forcing Apple to open up its ecosystem to third-party apps and services. This could reduce Apple's control and potentially impact its revenue streams and profitability in the UK market. While Apple states it will engage constructively, regulatory investigations can be costly and the outcome is uncertain. The CMA's increased focus on promoting competition likely creates a headwind for AAPL. The change in leadership at the CMA is unlikely to change the decision to investigate, especially given the Labour government's emphasis on prioritizing supporting growth while considering regulatory responsibilities. Thus, this news slightly increases the probability of a stock price decline. Also note, the news mentions Google, another company who could also face adverse impacts, suggesting potential for industry wide changes rather than just impacting Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and overall macroeconomic uncertainty.  The success of the Vision Pro headset and the company's broader innovation roadmap will be crucial factors influencing investor sentiment. The potential for share buybacks could offer some support.  Given the current 14% drop from the 2024 high and the overall cautious tone, the probability of a price increase is lower than a price decrease, although a significant drop is also not guaranteed. The overall market conditions also add to the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing a veteran executive, Kim Vorrath, known for fixing troubled products and managing major projects. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its lag in AI compared to peers like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The market may view this positively as a step towards improving Apple's competitive position in AI, which is a critical growth area. However, the news also mentions ongoing challenges, such as the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. Overall, the positive sentiment of proactive leadership and potential long-term benefits likely outweighs the short-term negatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging Apple users higher fares than Android users. This news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or services. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple is expected to post strong Q1 earnings, but faces challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite this, BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted slightly downward from $256 to $253, but this still suggests a positive outlook. Given the mixed information, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the strong Q1 earnings and positive analyst outlook are likely to have a more significant impact on investor sentiment than the anticipated decline in iPhone sales.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a decline in iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings. Despite strong overall earnings, the stock is pressured by negative market sentiments and poor performance in key markets. This suggests a more cautious market attitude towards Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant role in the market and includes a summary of its stock performance. With a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), there is a prevailing bearish sentiment towards the stock. Although Apple is considered a long-term strong player, its high P/E ratio and ongoing challenges suggest that short-term market movements might lean towards further declines. Furthermore, similar recent predictions have suggested a higher probability of stock price falling due to market conditions and competitive pressures. Therefore, combining the historical performance, market sentiment, and the current rating, I estimate a higher probability of price decline compared to the likelihood of a price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news of the UK's competition watchdog investigating Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Regulatory scrutiny and the potential for forced changes to its business practices, such as opening up its operating system and app store to third parties, can reduce Apple's control and profitability. The investigation creates uncertainty, which the market usually reacts negatively to. The fact that other models predicted a higher chance of stock price falling previously further support this. Compared to previous round, while CMA chief executive's words support market competition which would 'boost growth', the new Amazon UK Doug Gurr's replacement of chairman suggests that there is more inclination of supporting growth and supporting market competition. Therefore, the negative impacts brought by regulatory scrutiny still outweigh the potential growth.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower services segment growth due to regulatory pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainty.  The Vision Pro's success is crucial. Share buybacks could offer support. The 14% drop from the 2024 high and overall cautious tone suggest a higher probability of a price decrease. However, the positive EPS and revenue growth projections counterbalance this.  Previous predictions show a wide range, indicating considerable uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly bearish, but not overwhelmingly so. Considering all factors, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the existing negative sentiment and potential challenges, but acknowledging the possibility of a positive reaction to the earnings report if it surpasses expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products. This indicates Apple's commitment to addressing its lag in AI compared to peers like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The market may view this positively as a step towards improving Apple's competitive position in AI, which is a critical growth area. However, the news also mentions ongoing challenges, such as the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and setbacks like inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. The previous predictions show a mix of sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to broader market concerns, while others see potential in Apple's proactive measures. Considering the positive aspects of leadership change and long-term AI strategy, but balancing it with short-term challenges and mixed analyst sentiment, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Ola and Uber's pricing structures in India, specifically denying allegations of charging Apple users higher fares than Android users. This news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or services. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low, with a slight bias towards the stock price remaining stable or rising due to the overall market trend and previous predictions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with strong Q1 earnings expected but challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted slightly downward from $256 to $253, but this still suggests a positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of increasingly positive sentiment towards Apple's stock, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the overall market conditions and the decline in iPhone sales in China are still concerns. Taking into account the strong Q1 earnings and positive analyst outlook, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple including a decline in iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings. Despite strong overall earnings, the stock is pressured by negative market sentiments and poor performance in key markets. The news also mentions regulatory concerns and challenges in the AI domain. While there are positive sentiments regarding the company's efforts in AI and strategic moves, the current trends and analyst sentiments weigh heavier towards a negative outlook.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), reflecting both current challenges and potential future opportunities. While the year-to-date decline of 11.3% and the Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) indicate bearish sentiment, the Macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory pressures add to concerns regarding the iPhone and services revenue. However, the company's strategic focus on AI and positive analyst forecasts for Q1 earnings suggest some resilience. The divergence in predictions from various models demonstrates uncertainty, with many leaning towards a bearish sentiment, particularly due to regulatory scrutiny and declining market share. Overall, this leads to a higher probability of stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The UK's investigation into Apple's mobile ecosystem poses a significant regulatory risk. The CMA's ability to impose conduct requirements, potentially forcing Apple to open its platform to third parties, could negatively impact Apple's control and profitability. The investigation itself creates uncertainty, which markets dislike. While Apple states it will engage constructively, the potential for mandated changes to its business model outweighs any positive spin. Considering that the previous rounds show a dominant trend of estimating the stock price to fall, I will integrate and further enforce the falling prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While projected revenue and EPS growth are positive, significant concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment (due to regulatory pressures), and the overall macroeconomic climate. The success of the Vision Pro headset is crucial for future growth. Share buybacks might offer some support, but the 14% drop from the 2024 high and the generally cautious tone suggest a bearish bias.  Analysis of previous predictions shows a trend toward a slightly more positive outlook in the second round, however, the consistent presence of negative factors like slowing iPhone sales and regulatory pressures keeps the overall sentiment leaning bearish. The expected 3% YoY revenue increase and EPS rise are positive, but not strong enough to overcome the other headwinds.  The uncertainty surrounding the Vision Pro and general market conditions add to the complexity. Considering all factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, reflecting the existing negative sentiment and potential challenges but acknowledging the possibility of a positive reaction to the earnings report if it significantly exceeds expectations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to strengthen its AI and Siri capabilities by appointing Kim Vorrath, a veteran executive known for fixing troubled products.

This news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or services. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more relevant to Ola and Uber, and potentially the Indian ride-hailing market. Considering the lack of direct relevance to Apple's core business and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news is low, with a slight bias towards stability. However, given the overall market conditions and previous predictions that suggest a cautious outlook, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with strong Q1 earnings expected but challenges in the March quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches.

While Apple continues to face challenges such as declining iPhone market share in China and negative analyst ratings, it also shows positive signs like its commitment to AI through strategic moves. Previous predictions have shown a trend of mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a negative outlook due to market concerns, while others remain cautiously optimistic. The probability of the stock price rising is slightly supported by positive sentiments regarding company efforts and analyst outlook, but these probabilities need to balance with the existing market challenges.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
