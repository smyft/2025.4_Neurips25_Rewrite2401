(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stocks to watch next week: ASML, Intel, LVMH, Shell and Glencore\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as five of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nTesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will be releasing results next week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML, as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nRead more: What to look out for from Mag 7 earnings, including Nvidia and Tesla\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH's results can add to optimism.\n\nShell's latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by newly reinstated US president Donald Trump on lowering prices.\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore, which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nASML (ASML.AS) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter and full-year results on Wednesday 29 January\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early, which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nSince October's results release, ASML stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML.AS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole.

Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

(AAPL) is drawing significant market attention alongside its peer companies in the 'Magnificent 7', comprising other tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This heightened focus on earnings could lead to volatility in AAPL's stock price. With the backdrop of investor anxiety around economic conditions and the performance of major tech companies, it may create mixed sentiment. However, given the strong brand reputation and historical performance of Apple, it is likely that a substantial portion of investors will have positive expectations heading into the earnings release. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling, though due to the overall market uncertainty, the probabilities are not overwhelmingly skewed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). It mentions analyst downgrades due to disappointing iPhone sales and lack of AI interest, particularly in China where market share is declining. The company's valuation has also declined. However, it also states a one-time charge due to reversal of European General Court decision impacted EPS. Without that charge, EPS would have beaten expectations. Thus, despite the concerns around current iPhone sales and market position, it appears earnings would have beaten expectations without this unique charge, potentially signalling healthy business performance underneath the surface. In consideration of these counter forces, I would expect a slight dip in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating on Apple despite lowering its price target slightly from $256 to $253.  This suggests a relatively positive outlook, although some concerns exist.  The lowered price target reflects a weaker iPhone outlook for Q2, primarily due to macro-economic pressures and slower adoption of new features. However, BofA expects a strong Q1, exceeding Wall Street estimates for revenue and iPhone shipments.  The strong Services segment growth, particularly the App Store's 15% year-over-year jump, provides a counterbalance to the iPhone concerns. The expectation of easing regulatory pressures and potential margin boosts from the in-house 5G modem add to the positive factors. While the Q2 iPhone forecast downgrade is negative, the positive Q1 expectations, strong Services growth, and other mitigating factors suggest that the overall impact on the stock price will likely be slightly positive, though the uncertainty warrants a less than certain probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. Ives' bullish outlook on AI spending and monetization suggests optimism for Apple's upcoming earnings report. Given Apple's position as a major player in tech and its potential AI initiatives, the market may react positively to this sentiment. However, the actual stock movement will depend on the specifics of Apple's earnings report and guidance. The overall tone of the news is favorable, but there is always uncertainty around earnings announcements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's prospects. On one hand, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, which could positively impact the stock price. On the other hand, they forecast a decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and have cut their iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Despite this, BofA remains bullish on the stock due to its strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted to $253 from $256, but the firm still sees Apple as a positive investment. Given these factors, the stock price might experience a slight increase or remain stable in the short term, but there are also risks that could lead to a decrease if iPhone sales continue to decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that despite concerns over iPhone sales, BofA Securities remains bullish on Apple due to its earnings resiliency and strong Services segment. The firm expects a strong fiscal Q1 with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments. Although Q2 is expected to be weaker, the analysts believe China concerns are overblown and expect regulatory pressures to ease. Additionally, the potential success of Apple's in-house 5G modem could boost margins. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the article is positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings release for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is drawing significant attention, and previous predictions indicate a mixed outlook. There are concerns regarding iPhone sales and market presence, especially in China. However, analyst predictions from firms like BofA Securities remain relatively optimistic, highlighting strong potential for Q1 earnings and robust growth in the Services segment. The mixed nature of the news, with sentiment leaning towards a positive outlook but tempered by significant concerns, suggests that the probabilities for stock movement are somewhat balanced but tilted slightly towards a rise given the strong brand reputation and the potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While there were analyst downgrades related to iPhone sales and AI interest (or lack thereof), particularly in China, the prior round predictions indicate analysts and firms maintain a 'Buy' rating despite price target reductions which indicate expectation of overall continued financial success, but at a slightly slower pace. The previous predictions range from .4 to .7, demonstrating a lack of clear sentiment around the stock, but slight tendency to see the stock as a slightly positive investment which is further validated by reports of earnings without one-time impacts surpassing expectations. Taking all of this into account, suggests a slightly negative outlook for the short term earnings with a slightly higher chance of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While BofA maintains a buy rating and anticipates a strong Q1 exceeding expectations, concerns remain about a weaker Q2 due to macro pressures and slower iPhone adoption.  The lowered price target reflects this uncertainty.  However, several positive factors counterbalance these concerns: strong Services growth (especially the App Store), expectations of easing regulatory pressures, and the potential for margin improvement from the in-house 5G modem.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning bullish and others bearish, reflecting the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings announcements. Considering the mixed outlook and the variance in previous predictions, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise based on the expected strong Q1 and positive growth in Services, but acknowledge the potential for a price fall due to the Q2 concerns.  I am also taking into account that several of the earlier predictions suggest a rise in stock price, which suggests other information may be supporting this assumption.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments by companies like Apple. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that the market is underestimating the potential of AI-driven growth, which could positively impact Apple's stock price. Given Apple's strong brand reputation and historical performance, combined with the positive sentiment around AI, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the actual impact will depend on the specifics of Apple's earnings report and broader market conditions. Previous predictions show a mix of optimism and caution, but the overall sentiment leans slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. However, they also forecast a decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and have cut their iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite these concerns, BofA remains bullish on the stock, adjusting the price target to $253 from $256. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a positive short-term impact on the stock price, given the expectation of strong Q1 earnings and potential for product launches. However, the uncertainties around iPhone sales and macroeconomic conditions warrant a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's prospects, with BofA analysts expecting a strong fiscal Q1 but a weaker Q2 due to macro pressures and slower adoption of new iPhone features. However, the firm remains bullish on the stock due to its earnings resiliency, strong Services segment, and potential margin boosts from the in-house 5G modem. Considering the positive sentiment from the analyst and the strong historical performance of Apple, the overall probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous predictions from other models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models indicating a potential increase in the stock price due to the strong Q1 expectations and the mitigating factors such as easing regulatory pressures and strong Services growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China. On the other hand, BofA maintains a bullish outlook on the company, citing strong Services segment growth, earnings resiliency, and expectations for a strong Q1 earnings report. The upcoming earnings results will play a critical role in shaping market sentiment. Given that the bullish outlook and specific strong quarters are often met with positive sentiments, while continued challenges in iPhone sales remain a risk, the overall probability leans toward a slight increase, albeit with considerable market sensitivity.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company prepares for its upcoming earnings report amidst significant investor interest. While there are underlying concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in the critical Chinese market, BofA Securities maintains a buy rating due to expected strong performance in Q1 and robust growth in the Services segment. Overall, analysts express optimism about the potential for positive surprises in earnings driven by strong brand loyalty and innovation. Previous predictions ranged from slightly bullish to negative, indicating uncertainty but leaning towards a modestly positive sentiment leading into the earnings release. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than that of it falling, albeit with some caution due to market volatility and economic pressures.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article presents a predominantly negative outlook for Apple (AAPL) based on recent analyst downgrades due to weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI, especially in China, leading to a decline in market share. However, it also mentions that Q4 earnings, excluding a one-time charge, would have exceeded expectations. Previous predictions were mixed but slightly tilted towards a positive outlook, reflecting strong brand reputation and potential earnings surprises. Considering continued negative analyst pressure, I am reducing the probability of the stock price rising to significantly below average. The negative sentiment appears to be outweighing potentially successful earnings.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  BofA's maintained 'Buy' rating and expectation of a strong Q1, exceeding analyst estimates, are positive indicators. However, the lowered price target and weaker Q2 outlook due to macroeconomic factors and slower iPhone adoption introduce significant uncertainty. The strong Services segment growth, particularly the impressive App Store performance, and potential benefits from the in-house 5G modem offer counterbalancing positives.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty, but demonstrates a trend toward a slightly positive outlook.  Considering the potential for a strong Q1 to outweigh the Q2 concerns, at least in the short-term, and factoring the consensus leaning slightly toward a price increase (though not strongly), I assign probabilities reflecting a slightly higher chance of a price rise, but acknowledge the considerable room for movement in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with analyst Dan Ives expressing optimism about Big Tech earnings and AI investments, which could positively impact Apple's stock. However, there are also concerns about iPhone sales and market presence, particularly in China, which could temper the positive sentiment. Previous predictions from other models show a range of probabilities, with some leaning bullish and others bearish, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report. Given Apple's strong brand reputation and historical performance, combined with the positive sentiment around AI, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, but the actual impact will depend on the specifics of Apple's earnings report and broader market conditions.

While BofA analysts expect a strong Q1 earnings report, they also forecast a decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and have cut their iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Despite these concerns, BofA remains bullish on the stock due to its strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but overall, they lean slightly towards a positive outlook. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the overall sentiment from analysts, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with BofA Securities maintaining a Buy rating despite lowering its price target due to weaker iPhone outlook. The firm expects a strong fiscal Q1 with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments, slightly ahead of Wall Street's estimates. However, Q2 is expected to be weaker due to macro pressures and slower adoption of new iPhone features. The Services segment is expected to grow 13% in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year, providing a counterbalance to the iPhone concerns. Considering the positive sentiment from the analyst, the strong historical performance of Apple, and the previous predictions from other models, the overall probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The mixed outlook and uncertainties around iPhone sales and macroeconomic conditions warrant a cautious outlook, but the expected strong Q1 earnings and potential for product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem, support a slightly positive probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China. On the other hand, BofA maintains a bullish outlook on the company, citing strong Services segment growth, earnings resiliency, and expectations for a strong Q1 earnings report. The upcoming earnings results will play a critical role in shaping market sentiment. Previous predictions suggest a balance of optimism and caution, with slight leans towards the stock price rising, particularly due to the strong Q1 expectations and mitigating factors such as strong Services growth and easing regulatory pressures.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). There are significant concerns surrounding iPhone sales, particularly in the Chinese market, which have been highlighted by analyst downgrades. However, analysts from firms like BofA Securities maintain a positive outlook for Q1 earnings, suggesting that revenue and performance may exceed expectations, aided by strong growth in the Services segment. The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, with many analysts recognizing the potential for a strong Q1 performance to counterbalance the ongoing challenges. Thus, while there is caution due to uncertainties in iPhone sales, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The article presents a rather negative view of Apple's current situation. Several analysts have downgraded Apple due to disappointing iPhone sales and a lack of perceived innovation in AI, particularly concerning its presence in the Chinese market. The company's valuation has also experienced a decline. On the other hand, there is a mention of strong Q4 earnings when one-time charge is excluded. Previous predictions show various opinions ranging from a negative outlook toward positive growth. Considering the increasing negative analyst sentiment and the challenges confronting Apple, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  BofA's maintained 'Buy' rating and strong Q1 expectations are positive, but the lowered price target and weaker Q2 forecast due to macroeconomic factors and slower iPhone adoption create uncertainty.  The strong Services segment growth and potential margin improvements offer counterbalancing positives.  Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with a slight tendency toward a positive outlook, converging around 0.55-0.6 probability of a price rise in later rounds. This reflects the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings announcements and the market's reaction. Considering the mixed signals, the strong Q1 expectations (which are likely to have a short term positive impact) somewhat outweigh the Q2 concerns, and the overall trend in predictions, I assign probabilities reflecting a slightly higher chance of a price rise, but acknowledge the considerable uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Analyst Dan Ives expresses optimism about Big Tech earnings and AI investments, which could positively impact Apple's stock. However, there are also concerns about iPhone sales and market presence, particularly in China, which could temper the positive sentiment. Previous predictions from other models show a range of probabilities, with some leaning bullish and others bearish, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report. Given Apple's strong brand reputation and historical performance, combined with the positive sentiment around AI, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, but the actual impact will depend on the specifics of Apple's earnings report and broader market conditions. The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but with significant caution.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with BofA Securities maintaining a Buy rating despite lowering its price target due to weaker iPhone outlook. However, the firm expects a strong fiscal Q1 with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments, slightly ahead of Wall Street's estimates. The Services segment is expected to grow 13% in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year, providing a counterbalance to the iPhone concerns. Considering the positive sentiment from the analyst, the strong historical performance of Apple, and the previous predictions from other models, the overall probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc.
