(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings: Wall Street 'underestimating' tech, Ives says\nNews Content: Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is drawing significant market attention alongside its peer companies in the 'Magnificent 7', comprising other tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This heightened focus on earnings could lead to volatility in AAPL's stock price. With the backdrop of investor anxiety around economic conditions and the performance of major tech companies, it may create mixed sentiment. However, given the strong brand reputation and historical performance of Apple, it is likely that a substantial portion of investors will have positive expectations heading into the earnings release. This suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling, though due to the overall market uncertainty, the probabilities are not overwhelmingly skewed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). It mentions analyst downgrades due to disappointing iPhone sales and lack of AI interest, particularly in China where market share is declining. The company's valuation has also declined. However, it also states a one-time charge due to reversal of European General Court decision impacted EPS. Without that charge, EPS would have beaten expectations. Thus, despite the concerns around current iPhone sales and market position, it appears earnings would have beaten expectations without this unique charge, potentially signalling healthy business performance underneath the surface. In consideration of these counter forces, I would expect a slight dip in Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: BofA Securities maintains a Buy rating on Apple despite lowering its price target slightly from $256 to $253.  This suggests a relatively positive outlook, although some concerns exist.  The lowered price target reflects a weaker iPhone outlook for Q2, primarily due to macro-economic pressures and slower adoption of new features. However, BofA expects a strong Q1, exceeding Wall Street estimates for revenue and iPhone shipments.  The strong Services segment growth, particularly the App Store's 15% year-over-year jump, provides a counterbalance to the iPhone concerns. The expectation of easing regulatory pressures and potential margin boosts from the in-house 5G modem add to the positive factors. While the Q2 iPhone forecast downgrade is negative, the positive Q1 expectations, strong Services growth, and other mitigating factors suggest that the overall impact on the stock price will likely be slightly positive, though the uncertainty warrants a less than certain probability.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights positive sentiment from analyst Dan Ives regarding Big Tech earnings, particularly emphasizing the underestimated potential of AI investments by companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. Ives' bullish outlook on AI spending and monetization suggests optimism for Apple's upcoming earnings report. Given Apple's position as a major player in tech and its potential AI initiatives, the market may react positively to this sentiment. However, the actual stock movement will depend on the specifics of Apple's earnings report and guidance. The overall tone of the news is favorable, but there is always uncertainty around earnings announcements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's prospects. On one hand, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, which could positively impact the stock price. On the other hand, they forecast a decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and have cut their iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Despite this, BofA remains bullish on the stock due to its strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The price target has been adjusted to $253 from $256, but the firm still sees Apple as a positive investment. Given these factors, the stock price might experience a slight increase or remain stable in the short term, but there are also risks that could lead to a decrease if iPhone sales continue to decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that despite concerns over iPhone sales, BofA Securities remains bullish on Apple due to its earnings resiliency and strong Services segment. The firm expects a strong fiscal Q1 with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments. Although Q2 is expected to be weaker, the analysts believe China concerns are overblown and expect regulatory pressures to ease. Additionally, the potential success of Apple's in-house 5G modem could boost margins. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment of the article is positive, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The upcoming earnings release for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is drawing significant attention, and previous predictions indicate a mixed outlook. There are concerns regarding iPhone sales and market presence, especially in China. However, analyst predictions from firms like BofA Securities remain relatively optimistic, highlighting strong potential for Q1 earnings and robust growth in the Services segment. The mixed nature of the news, with sentiment leaning towards a positive outlook but tempered by significant concerns, suggests that the probabilities for stock movement are somewhat balanced but tilted slightly towards a rise given the strong brand reputation and the potential for positive earnings surprises.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While there were analyst downgrades related to iPhone sales and AI interest (or lack thereof), particularly in China, the prior round predictions indicate analysts and firms maintain a 'Buy' rating despite price target reductions which indicate expectation of overall continued financial success, but at a slightly slower pace. The previous predictions range from .4 to .7, demonstrating a lack of clear sentiment around the stock, but slight tendency to see the stock as a slightly positive investment which is further validated by reports of earnings without one-time impacts surpassing expectations. Taking all of this into account, suggests a slightly negative outlook for the short term earnings with a slightly higher chance of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While BofA maintains a buy rating and anticipates a strong Q1 exceeding expectations, concerns remain about a weaker Q2 due to macro pressures and slower iPhone adoption.  The lowered price target reflects this uncertainty.  However, several positive factors counterbalance these concerns: strong Services growth (especially the App Store), expectations of easing regulatory pressures, and the potential for margin improvement from the in-house 5G modem.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning bullish and others bearish, reflecting the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings announcements. Considering the mixed outlook and the variance in previous predictions, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a higher likelihood of a price rise based on the expected strong Q1 and positive growth in Services, but acknowledge the potential for a price fall due to the Q2 concerns.  I am also taking into account that several of the earlier predictions suggest a rise in stock price, which suggests other information may be supporting this assumption.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights a bullish outlook on Big Tech earnings, particularly focusing on AI investments by companies like Apple. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that the market is underestimating the potential of AI-driven growth, which could positively impact Apple's stock price. Given Apple's strong brand reputation and historical performance, combined with the positive sentiment around AI, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising. However, the actual impact will depend on the specifics of Apple's earnings report and broader market conditions. Previous predictions show a mix of optimism and caution, but the overall sentiment leans slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, BofA analysts expect Apple's Q1 earnings to beat estimates, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. However, they also forecast a decline in iPhone sales for the March quarter and have cut their iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite these concerns, BofA remains bullish on the stock, adjusting the price target to $253 from $256. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a positive short-term impact on the stock price, given the expectation of strong Q1 earnings and potential for product launches. However, the uncertainties around iPhone sales and macroeconomic conditions warrant a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view of Apple's prospects, with BofA analysts expecting a strong fiscal Q1 but a weaker Q2 due to macro pressures and slower adoption of new iPhone features. However, the firm remains bullish on the stock due to its earnings resiliency, strong Services segment, and potential margin boosts from the in-house 5G modem. Considering the positive sentiment from the analyst and the strong historical performance of Apple, the overall probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The previous predictions from other models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising, with some models indicating a potential increase in the stock price due to the strong Q1 expectations and the mitigating factors such as easing regulatory pressures and strong Services growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China. On the other hand, BofA maintains a bullish outlook on the company, citing strong Services segment growth, earnings resiliency, and expectations for a strong Q1 earnings report. The upcoming earnings results will play a critical role in shaping market sentiment. Given that the bullish outlook and specific strong quarters are often met with positive sentiments, while continued challenges in iPhone sales remain a risk, the overall probability leans toward a slight increase, albeit with considerable market sensitivity.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
