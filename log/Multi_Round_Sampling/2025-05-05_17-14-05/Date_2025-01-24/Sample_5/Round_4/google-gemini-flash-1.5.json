(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Ola's clarification regarding pricing policies, stating that it does not discriminate based on phone model. While this does not directly impact Apple's business, concerns about discriminatory pricing patterns could negatively influence brand perception. However, since the announcement was a defense against allegations rather than an indication of actual pricing malpractice and involves competitors rather than Apple directly, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited. The probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of stability or a minor rise due to the lack of negative news specific to Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple is taking steps to address its AI deficiencies by bringing in a seasoned executive to focus on improving Siri and other AI offerings. This is a positive signal as it acknowledges past shortcomings and demonstrates a commitment to catching up with competitors. However, the news also highlights past AI setbacks like suspending the news summarization feature and lagging behind competitors in the AI race. The integration of ChatGPT into Siri is a step forward, but also indicates a reliance on external solutions. Considering the potential positive impact of Vorrath's expertise being applied plus their catching up with peers, but also accounting for the previous failures and the need to make up for lost ground, the effect on stock price will likely be neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While ChatGPT ranks AAPL as the top stock for long-term growth, the article also highlights potential downsides such as Trump's planned tariffs and overall market uncertainty.  The positive aspects include Apple's strong Q4 2024 earnings exceeding expectations, the positive outlook from Wall Street analysts with an average 8% upside potential, and the potential for increased sales due to the integration of AI in the new iPhone. However, the reliance on ChatGPT's prediction introduces uncertainty, and the article itself suggests that AI stocks might offer even better returns in the shorter term.  Considering these factors, a moderate increase in probability is expected but not guaranteed, given the inherent volatility of the market and the broader geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news content discusses general options trading strategies for mega-cap tech stocks, specifically mentioning the 'Magnificent Seven' and a synthetic long position on Amazon (AMZN). However, it does not provide any concrete, company-specific information or catalysts for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The discussion is more about market sentiment and volatility ('large moves are up and down') rather than directional bias. Since the news is neutral and lacks AAPL-specific insights, the probabilities of a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price remain balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with a strong Q1 earnings report expected but challenges in the subsequent quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite this, BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The adjusted price target from $256 to $253 is a slight decrease but still indicates a positive outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but the overall impact is expected to be moderate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. has a new executive in the AI division, Kim Vorrath, who is known for her expertise in program management and product development. This suggests that Apple is doubling down on improving its AI and Siri, areas where it has lagged behind competitors. While it acknowledges current shortcomings, it also highlights future improvements and updates planned for the upcoming year, including potential enhancements to Siri. These developments could positively impact investor sentiment as they suggest a strategic push towards addressing key challenges in crucial technological areas.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news mostly centers around Ola's denial of implementing phone model-based pricing, which doesn't directly impact Apple. Although there can be indirect concerns regarding brand perception, the clarification from Ola indicates no actual discriminatory practices were in place. Therefore, the impact on Apple is minimal. Previous predictions from others reveal a mix of sentiments, leaning slightly towards stability or a gentle rise, with the majority considering external factors such as company earnings and strategic moves in AI. Given that this news isn't directly negative for Apple, I predict a slight bias towards the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's efforts to improve its AI capabilities, particularly Siri, by bringing in a seasoned executive, Kim Vorrath. This move signals a commitment to addressing shortcomings and closing the gap with competitors like OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. While the article acknowledges past failures (e.g., suspended news summarization feature, slow integration of ChatGPT), Vorrath's experience and the strategic importance of AI suggest potential for future improvements. Previous models show varied predictions, with most leaning towards a slightly positive or neutral impact. Considering Apple's known AI deficiencies and taking note of the positive news elements, I would predict a moderate increase in stock price. However, I am reducing my probability for rise because other predictions are mixed, with some tending towards neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations and analysts are bullish with an 8% upside potential, several uncertainties exist.  ChatGPT's prediction, while placing AAPL first, is not a guarantee.  Potential tariffs and broader economic/geopolitical concerns could negatively impact the stock. The positive factors are strong Q4 results, analyst optimism, and AI integration into new products.  However, the reliance on ChatGPT's prediction introduces uncertainty, and the article itself suggests AI stocks might offer better short-term returns. Considering previous predictions ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 probability of a rise, I am weighting the moderate positive outlook with the significant uncertainties.  The overall impact is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher chance of a rise due to the strong earnings report and positive analyst sentiment, but significant uncertainty remains.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news content discusses general options trading strategies for mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any specific, actionable information or catalysts directly related to AAPL. The discussion focuses on market sentiment and volatility ('large moves are up and down') rather than a directional bias for AAPL. Given the neutral nature of the news and the lack of AAPL-specific insights, the probabilities of a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price remain balanced. Previous predictions also indicate a mixed outlook, with some models leaning slightly positive due to broader market trends or Apple's strategic moves in AI, but this particular news item does not add significant new information to sway the probabilities strongly in either direction.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific information that could impact its stock price. The discussion revolves around general options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks, with a specific mention of Amazon (AMZN). Since there is no concrete information or catalysts mentioned for Apple, the news is considered neutral and lacks AAPL-specific insights. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price remain balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with a strong Q1 earnings report expected but challenges in the subsequent quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Despite this, BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches. The adjusted price target from $256 to $253 is a slight decrease but still indicates a positive outlook. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising due to various factors such as positive earnings expectations, strong cash flow, and potential for product launches, the overall analysis suggests a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. The market's reaction to the earnings report and the company's future announcements will be crucial in determining the stock's direction. Given the generally positive sentiment and the slight decrease in the price target, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple enlisting a seasoned executive, Kim Vorrath, known for fixing troubled products, to improve AI and Siri. This signifies Apple's efforts to address shortcomings in AI, an area where it has lagged behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. Given the positive signal of acknowledging past issues and demonstrating a strong commitment to improvement, investor sentiment is likely to be uplifted. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, suggesting a moderate to high belief in stock price stabilization or minor increase due to the strategic decision. Therefore, considering the strategic move and past trends, there is a reasonable expectation that the stock price will experience a rise.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding Ola's clarification on its pricing policies does not directly impact Apple Inc.'s business. The focus on uniform pricing in Ola's ride-hailing service may help alleviate concerns about brand perception for Apple products in the context of perceived unfair pricing based on phone models. Given the lack of direct negative implications for Apple and considering the previous predictions, which range from neutral to slightly positive sentiment driven by Apple's strategic initiatives and AI advancements, the stock price is likely to see a modest rise. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple bringing in Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges, specifically improving Siri and other AI offerings. While this is a positive move indicating Apple's commitment to catching up in the AI race, it also acknowledges existing weaknesses and past setbacks. The previous round of predictions shows varied sentiment, with most leaning slightly positive or neutral but some are skeptical. Considering both the positive news of Vorrath's appointment and the negative context of Apple lagging in AI, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising, but not by a large margin, because past execution is imperfect.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news is a mixed bag for Apple.  While ChatGPT ranks AAPL as a top long-term investment, and Apple exceeded Q4 2024 earnings expectations, several factors introduce uncertainty.  These include potential negative impacts from Trump's proposed tariffs, general geopolitical instability, and the inherent unreliability of using ChatGPT for financial predictions.  The positive aspects are strong Q4 results, positive analyst sentiment (8% upside potential), and the integration of AI in new products, which could stimulate future sales.  Considering the previous predictions which range from 0.5 to 0.7 for a price rise, and the inherent volatility of the market and the mixed nature of this news, I'm assigning a probability slightly weighted towards a price increase, reflecting the strong earnings and positive analyst outlook, but acknowledging the significant uncertainties that could result in a flat or even slightly negative market response.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news content discusses general options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

The discussion focuses on market sentiment and volatility ('large moves are up and down') rather than a directional bias for AAPL. Given the neutral nature of the news and the lack of AAPL-specific insights, the probabilities of a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price remain balanced.

However, considering the trend of previous predictions which generally lean towards a slightly positive outlook due to various factors such as positive earnings expectations, strong cash flow, and potential for product launches, a moderate bias towards a rise is assumed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with a strong Q1 earnings report expected but challenges in the subsequent quarter due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features.

The absence of negative implications for Apple and the prevailing positive sentiment from prior predictions, which reflect strategic advancements in AI and positive earnings sentiment, suggest a stable or slightly rising stock price environment. Most recent predictions lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, given the ongoing improvements and market support for Apple's initiatives.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.63, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.37, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple bringing in Kim Vorrath to tackle AI challenges, indicating a commitment to improving Siri and other AI offerings, which is generally viewed as a positive step towards catching up with competitors. However, the news also acknowledges Apple's shortcomings and past AI failures. Considering the past predictions which are mostly leaning towards a slightly positive outlook, and weighing both the positive and negative aspects of the news, there is slightly more reason for the stock price to go up. The stock price may change 2-3% given that this is not an ultimate solution, but is progress towards it.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is mixed.  While Apple's Q4 2024 earnings exceeded expectations, and analysts are bullish with an 8% projected upside, several uncertainties exist.  The reliance on ChatGPT's prediction is questionable, and potential tariffs and broader economic/geopolitical factors introduce risk.  The positive aspects are strong recent earnings, positive analyst sentiment, and AI integration in new products. The article itself suggests AI stocks may offer better short-term returns.  Considering previous predictions, which range from 0.5 to 0.7 probability of a price rise, and the inherent volatility of the market, I'm assigning a probability slightly weighted towards a price increase. The appointment of Kim Vorrath to address AI shortcomings is a positive signal, showing a proactive response to a known weakness. However, the success of this initiative is uncertain and will impact the stock price over time. The overall likelihood of a price increase is moderate, reflecting a balance of positive and negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news content discusses general options trading strategies for the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc.
