      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Sector Update: Tech Stocks Fall Late Afternoon\nNews Content: Tech stocks were in the red late Friday afternoon, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with significant experience at Apple, to tackle AI challenges signals a strategic move towards enhancing Apple's AI offerings, particularly Siri. This could instill confidence among investors, as it demonstrates a commitment to improving a product that has struggled to keep pace with competitors. However, the acknowledgment of prior setbacks in AI development may temper expectations. Thus, while there is a positive sentiment due to new leadership in the AI department, the existing challenges in the AI space may lead to mixed reactions in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news paints a bearish picture for Apple. The stock has underperformed significantly, experiencing its worst start since 2008. It's approaching its 200-day moving average, a key support level. If this level is breached, technical analysts predict further downside, potentially to $208. While earnings could be a catalyst for a rebound, the overall sentiment leaning towards further decline cannot be ignored. The weakness in Apple has not materially impacted the S&P 500 as of yet but should other large technology stocks weaken in tandem, negative follow through for Apple could weaken the index and trigger a potential market correction. Taking into consideration the negative momentum and technical indicators, albeit with a potential earning-related bounce, I slightly favour the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's recent performance has been negatively impacted by declining iPhone market share in China and analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in AI.  While the overall tech sector is benefiting from Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple's specific situation suggests a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The article mentions two analyst downgrades and weaker than expected iPhone sales.  However, the long-term prospects for Apple remain positive due to its strong brand and potential involvement in future AI initiatives, though this is not explicitly stated in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google, which could lead to pro-competition interventions. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially impose restrictions or requirements on Apple's iOS ecosystem, app store, and browser dominance. Such interventions might limit Apple's control over its ecosystem, potentially impacting its revenue streams from app store commissions and other services. However, Apple's statement indicates a willingness to engage constructively with the CMA, which might mitigate some negative perceptions. Historically, regulatory investigations can lead to uncertainty and negative investor sentiment in the short term, but the long-term impact depends on the outcomes and Apple's ability to adapt. Given the potential for increased regulatory pressure and uncertainty, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years. The article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including its record revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as its integration of artificial intelligence in its new iPhone device. Additionally, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock with an average share price upside potential of 8%. However, the article also notes potential downsides, including the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole are facing decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this overall market sentiment. However, the news alone does not provide specific details about Apple's individual performance but rather sets an overarching context. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood for Apple's stock price to fall alongside the broader sector, but it could also demonstrate resilience due to its strong fundamentals.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
