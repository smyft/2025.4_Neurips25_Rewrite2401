(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with significant experience at Apple, to tackle AI challenges signals a strategic move towards enhancing Apple's AI offerings, particularly Siri. This could instill confidence among investors, as it demonstrates a commitment to improving a product that has struggled to keep pace with competitors. However, the acknowledgment of prior setbacks in AI development may temper expectations. Thus, while there is a positive sentiment due to new leadership in the AI department, the existing challenges in the AI space may lead to mixed reactions in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news paints a bearish picture for Apple. The stock has underperformed significantly, experiencing its worst start since 2008. It's approaching its 200-day moving average, a key support level. If this level is breached, technical analysts predict further downside, potentially to $208. While earnings could be a catalyst for a rebound, the overall sentiment leaning towards further decline cannot be ignored. The weakness in Apple has not materially impacted the S&P 500 as of yet but should other large technology stocks weaken in tandem, negative follow through for Apple could weaken the index and trigger a potential market correction. Taking into consideration the negative momentum and technical indicators, albeit with a potential earning-related bounce, I slightly favour the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's recent performance has been negatively impacted by declining iPhone market share in China and analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in AI.  While the overall tech sector is benefiting from Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple's specific situation suggests a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The article mentions two analyst downgrades and weaker than expected iPhone sales.  However, the long-term prospects for Apple remain positive due to its strong brand and potential involvement in future AI initiatives, though this is not explicitly stated in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google, which could lead to pro-competition interventions. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially impose restrictions or requirements on Apple's iOS ecosystem, app store, and browser dominance. Such interventions might limit Apple's control over its ecosystem, potentially impacting its revenue streams from app store commissions and other services. However, Apple's statement indicates a willingness to engage constructively with the CMA, which might mitigate some negative perceptions. Historically, regulatory investigations can lead to uncertainty and negative investor sentiment in the short term, but the long-term impact depends on the outcomes and Apple's ability to adapt. Given the potential for increased regulatory pressure and uncertainty, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years. The article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including its record revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as its integration of artificial intelligence in its new iPhone device. Additionally, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock with an average share price upside potential of 8%. However, the article also notes potential downsides, including the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole are facing decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this overall market sentiment. However, the news alone does not provide specific details about Apple's individual performance but rather sets an overarching context. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood for Apple's stock price to fall alongside the broader sector, but it could also demonstrate resilience due to its strong fundamentals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to address AI challenges at Apple is a strategic move that could be perceived positively by investors, especially given her significant experience at the company. This signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI offerings, which might boost confidence among shareholders. However, the news highlights recent setbacks in AI, including Siri's performance issues, and underscores Apple's struggle against competitors in the AI sector. Coupled with the analysis from previous rounds suggesting bearish sentiment due to broader market trends and recent negative performance, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism. Considering the mixed signals, my estimation indicates a slightly higher probability of falling stocks as the technical indicators and overall market sentiment remain crucial.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's recent struggles, including its worst start to a year since 2008, underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and proximity to a key technical level (200-day moving average). Breaching this level could signal further decline, with $208 as the next target. However, the article also mentions potential for a rebound if Apple beats earnings expectations or buyers see the 200-day moving average as a buying opportunity. Analyzing sentiment in the previous rounds reveals a prevailing bearish view, largely attributed to concerns over Apple's performance and potential regulatory issues. Given the continued negative trend and technical analysis, I believe the probability of a further stock price decline is slightly higher, considering the earnings report as the potential catalyst for a price change.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants and their earnings, with Apple being one of them. While the overall tone suggests a positive outlook for the tech sector fueled by Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple's situation is presented more cautiously.  Two analyst downgrades, declining iPhone market share in China, and concerns about weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI efforts paint a bearish picture in the short term.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, reflecting the uncertainty.  While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the immediate news is negative.  Therefore, the probability of a short-term price fall is considered higher than a rise, though not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the potential for a rebound based on overall market sentiment and the company's robust fundamentals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Apple's mobile ecosystem, which could lead to pro-competition interventions. Such regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors in the short term, potentially impacting Apple's control over its ecosystem and revenue streams. While Apple has expressed a willingness to engage constructively with the CMA, the immediate market reaction is likely to be cautious. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of 0.6 for a fall and 0.4 for a rise. Considering the regulatory risks and the broader market sentiment, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided financial news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) but discusses the overall market performance and trends. The news mentions that US equity markets surged under President Trump's first week back in office, which could have a positive impact on tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, it highlights the performance of Bitcoin and gold prices approaching record highs, but does not provide direct information about Apple's stock performance. However, given that the overall market is experiencing a surge and considering the strong performance of tech stocks in general, there might be a positive sentiment towards Apple and other tech companies. The previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, but overall, there seems to be a cautious or slightly negative outlook on Apple's stock price due to various factors such as regulatory scrutiny, weak iPhone sales, and declining market share in China. However, some models also consider the potential for long-term growth and positive investor sentiment. Taking into consideration the positive start of the US equity markets and potential resilience of tech stocks, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years. The article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including its record revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as its integration of artificial intelligence in its new iPhone device. Additionally, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock with an average share price upside potential of 8%. However, the article also notes potential downsides, including the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment among the models, with some favoring a rise in stock price and others predicting a fall. Nevertheless, the overall trend suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the company's strong financials and potential for long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole are facing decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this overall market sentiment. Several predictions from previous rounds suggest a downward trend due to various factors like earnings, AI development challenges, regulatory scrutiny, and general market conditions. The recent predictions lean heavily towards a fall in stock price based on current trends and potential negative sentiments. Although there are some positive sentiments about AI advancements and regulatory engagement, the immediate concern around market-wide tech stock declines and previous analyst downgrades weigh more heavily.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to address AI challenges is a strategic move that can instill confidence in investors due to her extensive experience with Apple and her previous key roles in major product developments. However, the article also highlights Apple's recent struggles with AI and setbacks with Siri, which may temper immediate positive sentiment. Furthermore, broader market conditions and negative trends from previous analysis lean towards caution. Given the significant uncertainty and mixed signals from past predictions, I estimate a moderately higher probability of a stock price fall, reflecting both the opportunity for long-term growth against current challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds, as highlighted by its worst start to the year since 2008 and underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The stock is approaching its 200-day moving average, a crucial technical level. Breaking below this level could trigger further declines, with a potential target of $208. While an earnings beat could provide a rebound, the prevailing sentiment, as reflected in previous analyses, leans bearish. Earnings are due on Jan 30th presenting a major catalyst. Taking into account both the negative technical signals and potential for a beat on earnings, as well as the trend in previous predictions, it seems the likelihood of a fall is still slightly higher than the rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector, including Apple, is benefiting from Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple itself is facing several headwinds.  These include declining iPhone market share in China, analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI efforts, and the overall bearish sentiment towards tech stocks.  The previous predictions are quite diverse, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals and long-term prospects, while others favor a price fall due to short-term challenges and negative market sentiment.  Considering the conflicting information, the relatively weak recent performance of Apple and its dependence on the iPhone market, I slightly favor the probability of a fall in the short term, though the probability of a rise is not negligible due to the potential positive effects of the broader AI investment boost.  I am weighing the negative short-term factors more heavily than the potential long-term positive impacts of the broader AI investment, but acknowledge the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Apple's mobile ecosystem, which could lead to pro-competition interventions.

However, it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with many leaning towards a cautious or slightly negative outlook on Apple's stock price due to factors such as regulatory scrutiny, weak iPhone sales, and declining market share in China. Despite the positive start of the US equity markets and potential resilience of tech stocks, the overall trend from previous rounds suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to immediate concerns and negative sentiments. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years.

Previous predictions show a mix of sentiments influenced by negative market trends, poor performance in key markets like China, AI development setbacks, and regulatory scrutiny. There's some positive sentiment due to Apple's strengths in AI and overall market buoyancy under Trump administration policies, but bearish tones dominate the majority of predictions.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath signals a strategic commitment to enhancing Apple's AI capabilities, which may instill confidence among investors. However, recent setbacks in AI development and competition with rivals temper this optimism. The stock has also faced broader market challenges and technical indicators suggesting a decline. Given these mixed signals, the estimated probabilities reflect a slightly higher risk of a price fall due to ongoing concerns and market sentiment, though there remains potential for a rise based on specific changes in sentiment around Apple's AI advancements.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Apple's stock is currently facing a confluence of negative factors, including its worst start to the year since 2008, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and proximity to its 200-day moving average, a key technical support level. A breach of this level could trigger further decline, potentially down to $208. Earnings are scheduled for release soon which can swing the stock price. Although some analysts point out that the 200-day MA level may act as a buy and earning beat may swing the stock price high. Considering all factors, it is more likely for the stock price to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector is benefiting from Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple faces specific headwinds. These include declining iPhone market share in China, analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales and a lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI efforts.  The previous predictions from various models are quite diverse, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. Some models lean towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals and long-term prospects, while others favor a price fall due to short-term challenges and negative market sentiment.  The overall trend in the previous predictions leans slightly bearish, with a weighted average closer to a higher probability of a fall. However, the potential impact of Trump's AI initiatives and overall market positivity cannot be ignored.  Considering the conflicting information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the significant uncertainty and potential for a positive surprise based on the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Apple's mobile ecosystem, which could lead to pro-competition interventions.
