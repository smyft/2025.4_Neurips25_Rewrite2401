(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Thursday\u2019s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 4% to touch a fresh record high to start the year. Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath, a veteran with significant experience at Apple, to tackle AI challenges signals a strategic move towards enhancing Apple's AI offerings, particularly Siri. This could instill confidence among investors, as it demonstrates a commitment to improving a product that has struggled to keep pace with competitors. However, the acknowledgment of prior setbacks in AI development may temper expectations. Thus, while there is a positive sentiment due to new leadership in the AI department, the existing challenges in the AI space may lead to mixed reactions in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news paints a bearish picture for Apple. The stock has underperformed significantly, experiencing its worst start since 2008. It's approaching its 200-day moving average, a key support level. If this level is breached, technical analysts predict further downside, potentially to $208. While earnings could be a catalyst for a rebound, the overall sentiment leaning towards further decline cannot be ignored. The weakness in Apple has not materially impacted the S&P 500 as of yet but should other large technology stocks weaken in tandem, negative follow through for Apple could weaken the index and trigger a potential market correction. Taking into consideration the negative momentum and technical indicators, albeit with a potential earning-related bounce, I slightly favour the stock price falling in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's recent performance has been negatively impacted by declining iPhone market share in China and analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in AI.  While the overall tech sector is benefiting from Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple's specific situation suggests a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. The article mentions two analyst downgrades and weaker than expected iPhone sales.  However, the long-term prospects for Apple remain positive due to its strong brand and potential involvement in future AI initiatives, though this is not explicitly stated in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google, which could lead to pro-competition interventions. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially impose restrictions or requirements on Apple's iOS ecosystem, app store, and browser dominance. Such interventions might limit Apple's control over its ecosystem, potentially impacting its revenue streams from app store commissions and other services. However, Apple's statement indicates a willingness to engage constructively with the CMA, which might mitigate some negative perceptions. Historically, regulatory investigations can lead to uncertainty and negative investor sentiment in the short term, but the long-term impact depends on the outcomes and Apple's ability to adapt. Given the potential for increased regulatory pressure and uncertainty, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years. The article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including its record revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as its integration of artificial intelligence in its new iPhone device. Additionally, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock with an average share price upside potential of 8%. However, the article also notes potential downsides, including the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole are facing decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this overall market sentiment. However, the news alone does not provide specific details about Apple's individual performance but rather sets an overarching context. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood for Apple's stock price to fall alongside the broader sector, but it could also demonstrate resilience due to its strong fundamentals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to address AI challenges at Apple is a strategic move that could be perceived positively by investors, especially given her significant experience at the company. This signals Apple's commitment to enhancing its AI offerings, which might boost confidence among shareholders. However, the news highlights recent setbacks in AI, including Siri's performance issues, and underscores Apple's struggle against competitors in the AI sector. Coupled with the analysis from previous rounds suggesting bearish sentiment due to broader market trends and recent negative performance, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism. Considering the mixed signals, my estimation indicates a slightly higher probability of falling stocks as the technical indicators and overall market sentiment remain crucial.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's recent struggles, including its worst start to a year since 2008, underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and proximity to a key technical level (200-day moving average). Breaching this level could signal further decline, with $208 as the next target. However, the article also mentions potential for a rebound if Apple beats earnings expectations or buyers see the 200-day moving average as a buying opportunity. Analyzing sentiment in the previous rounds reveals a prevailing bearish view, largely attributed to concerns over Apple's performance and potential regulatory issues. Given the continued negative trend and technical analysis, I believe the probability of a further stock price decline is slightly higher, considering the earnings report as the potential catalyst for a price change.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants and their earnings, with Apple being one of them. While the overall tone suggests a positive outlook for the tech sector fueled by Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple's situation is presented more cautiously.  Two analyst downgrades, declining iPhone market share in China, and concerns about weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI efforts paint a bearish picture in the short term.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, reflecting the uncertainty.  While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the immediate news is negative.  Therefore, the probability of a short-term price fall is considered higher than a rise, though not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the potential for a rebound based on overall market sentiment and the company's robust fundamentals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Apple's mobile ecosystem, which could lead to pro-competition interventions. Such regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty and negative sentiment among investors in the short term, potentially impacting Apple's control over its ecosystem and revenue streams. While Apple has expressed a willingness to engage constructively with the CMA, the immediate market reaction is likely to be cautious. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of 0.6 for a fall and 0.4 for a rise. Considering the regulatory risks and the broader market sentiment, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided financial news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) but discusses the overall market performance and trends. The news mentions that US equity markets surged under President Trump's first week back in office, which could have a positive impact on tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, it highlights the performance of Bitcoin and gold prices approaching record highs, but does not provide direct information about Apple's stock performance. However, given that the overall market is experiencing a surge and considering the strong performance of tech stocks in general, there might be a positive sentiment towards Apple and other tech companies. The previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, but overall, there seems to be a cautious or slightly negative outlook on Apple's stock price due to various factors such as regulatory scrutiny, weak iPhone sales, and declining market share in China. However, some models also consider the potential for long-term growth and positive investor sentiment. Taking into consideration the positive start of the US equity markets and potential resilience of tech stocks, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years. The article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including its record revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as its integration of artificial intelligence in its new iPhone device. Additionally, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock with an average share price upside potential of 8%. However, the article also notes potential downsides, including the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment among the models, with some favoring a rise in stock price and others predicting a fall. Nevertheless, the overall trend suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the company's strong financials and potential for long-term growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a broader trend where tech stocks as a whole are facing decline pressures in the late afternoon trading session. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector, it is likely to be influenced by this overall market sentiment. Several predictions from previous rounds suggest a downward trend due to various factors like earnings, AI development challenges, regulatory scrutiny, and general market conditions. The recent predictions lean heavily towards a fall in stock price based on current trends and potential negative sentiments. Although there are some positive sentiments about AI advancements and regulatory engagement, the immediate concern around market-wide tech stock declines and previous analyst downgrades weigh more heavily.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The appointment of Kim Vorrath to address AI challenges is a strategic move that can instill confidence in investors due to her extensive experience with Apple and her previous key roles in major product developments. However, the article also highlights Apple's recent struggles with AI and setbacks with Siri, which may temper immediate positive sentiment. Furthermore, broader market conditions and negative trends from previous analysis lean towards caution. Given the significant uncertainty and mixed signals from past predictions, I estimate a moderately higher probability of a stock price fall, reflecting both the opportunity for long-term growth against current challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: Apple's stock is facing significant headwinds, as highlighted by its worst start to the year since 2008 and underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The stock is approaching its 200-day moving average, a crucial technical level. Breaking below this level could trigger further declines, with a potential target of $208. While an earnings beat could provide a rebound, the prevailing sentiment, as reflected in previous analyses, leans bearish. Earnings are due on Jan 30th presenting a major catalyst. Taking into account both the negative technical signals and potential for a beat on earnings, as well as the trend in previous predictions, it seems the likelihood of a fall is still slightly higher than the rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the broader tech sector, including Apple, is benefiting from Trump's pro-AI policies and increased investment, Apple itself is facing several headwinds.  These include declining iPhone market share in China, analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales and lack of consumer interest in Apple's AI efforts, and the overall bearish sentiment towards tech stocks.  The previous predictions are quite diverse, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals and long-term prospects, while others favor a price fall due to short-term challenges and negative market sentiment.  Considering the conflicting information, the relatively weak recent performance of Apple and its dependence on the iPhone market, I slightly favor the probability of a fall in the short term, though the probability of a rise is not negligible due to the potential positive effects of the broader AI investment boost.  I am weighing the negative short-term factors more heavily than the potential long-term positive impacts of the broader AI investment, but acknowledge the uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a regulatory investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into Apple's mobile ecosystem, which could lead to pro-competition interventions.

While Apple has expressed a willingness to engage constructively with the CMA, the immediate market reaction is likely to be cautious. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with an average probability of 0.6 for a fall and 0.4 for a rise. Considering the regulatory risks and the broader market sentiment, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses the overall market performance under President Trump's first week back in office, highlighting a surge in US equity markets. However, it does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, with many leaning towards a cautious or slightly negative outlook on Apple's stock price due to factors such as regulatory scrutiny, weak iPhone sales, and declining market share in China. Despite the positive start of the US equity markets and potential resilience of tech stocks, the overall trend from previous rounds suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to immediate concerns and negative sentiments. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential for long-term growth and its ranking as the top stock predicted by ChatGPT to make investors wealthy in 10 years.

Previous predictions show a mix of sentiments influenced by negative market trends, poor performance in key markets like China, AI development setbacks, and regulatory scrutiny. There's some positive sentiment due to Apple's strengths in AI and overall market buoyancy under Trump administration policies, but bearish tones dominate the majority of predictions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
