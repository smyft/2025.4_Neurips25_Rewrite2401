However, the news itself is retrospective; it explains past performance, not future prospects.  While positive investor sentiment is a bullish indicator, it doesn't guarantee future price increases.  Past performance is never a guarantee of future results.  There are always inherent risks in the stock market. A 30% gain is also quite substantial, suggesting the stock might be overvalued or due for a correction.  Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher due to positive investor sentiment, it's not overwhelmingly high.  We should consider a probability for a fall reflecting the inherent market volatility and potential for correction from a recent large gain. \",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Gained 30% Last Year\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
