However, as a major player in the tech industry, Apple's stock price might be influenced by significant developments in the AI space, particularly if they are perceived as competitive or complementary to Apple's own offerings. Given the lack of direct connection between the news and Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Nonetheless, the advancement in AI technology could potentially benefit Apple in the long run if it decides to integrate or develop similar technologies, which might slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising.
