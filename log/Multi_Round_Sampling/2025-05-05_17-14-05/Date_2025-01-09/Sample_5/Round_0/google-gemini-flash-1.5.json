However, the news itself is retrospective; it explains past performance, not future prospects.  While the positive investor sentiment suggests a higher probability of a price rise, it's not a guarantee.  Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  Numerous other factors, including market conditions, economic trends, and specific company announcements, will influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, while the probability of a rise is higher than a fall due to the positive investor sentiment reflected in the news, it's not a certainty.
