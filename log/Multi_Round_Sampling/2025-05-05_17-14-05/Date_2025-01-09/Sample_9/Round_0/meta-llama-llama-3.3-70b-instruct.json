However, as a major player in the tech industry, Apple's stock price could be influenced by significant developments in the AI space, particularly if they are perceived as lagging behind in innovation. Given that the news does not specifically mention Apple or any direct impact on the company, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low. Nonetheless, if investors perceive Apple as being in competition with xAI or other AI companies, and believe Apple is not keeping pace, there could be a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.2,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}"
