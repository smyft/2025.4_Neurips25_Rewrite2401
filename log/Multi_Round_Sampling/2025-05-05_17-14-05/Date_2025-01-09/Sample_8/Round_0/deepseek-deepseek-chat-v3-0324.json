While this news is about a competitor in the AI sector, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as Apple is not mentioned in the context of this development. Apple has its own AI initiatives (e.g., Siri, on-device AI, and potential future AI integrations), but this news is unlikely to have a material effect on Apple's stock price. The market may view this as neutral or slightly negative if investors perceive increased competition in AI as a long-term threat.
