However, the news itself is retrospective; it reports on past performance, not future predictions. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, the positive investor sentiment indicated suggests a higher probability of a price rise than a fall in the short-to-medium term.  The lack of specific new information about Apple's prospects makes it impossible to assign high confidence to any prediction. Therefore, I assign a moderately high probability to a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in the stock market.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Apple Stock Gained 30% Last Year\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
