(AAPL) but rather indicates increased competition in the AI space. However, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal since the company's primary focus is not on the same generative AI space as xAI or its competitors. Apple's involvement in AI is more integrated into its existing products and services rather than being a standalone offering. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price. Given the nature of the news, it might attract some indirect attention to tech and AI-focused companies, but the direct impact on Apple is expected to be negligible.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
