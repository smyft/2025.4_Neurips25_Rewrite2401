Apple's stock price is unlikely to be directly affected by this news as it pertains more to the competitive landscape of AI startups rather than Apple's core business or recent announcements. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of significant stock price movement due to this news. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is roughly equal, with a slight bias towards stability, but given the indirect nature, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to a fall due to potential concerns about competition in AI, although this is speculative.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
