      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Launches Stand-Alone Grok App\nNews Content: The AI startup launched its first stand-alone consumer app, as the company tries to catch up with more established players such as OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race.\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app indicates a competitive move in the AI space, which primarily involves companies like OpenAI and Google. While it highlights innovation in the AI sector, it does not directly impact Apple Inc., which is not primarily focused on AI software but rather on hardware and ecosystem integration. Therefore, the indirect effect of this news on Apple's stock is minimal, suggesting that the stock price is likely to remain stable with slight probabilities for rise or fall based on broader market trends or investor sentiment unrelated to this specific news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline compares Apple to Microsoft in the context of Artificial Intelligence stocks for 2025. This is a comparative analysis, not directly positive or negative news for either company individually. The market's reaction will depend on investor perception of Apple's AI capabilities relative to Microsoft, and the overall sentiment regarding AI investments. If investors believe Apple is positioned to compete effectively in the AI space, the stock could rise. Conversely, a perception that Apple lags behind could lead to a decline. Given the ambiguity and the inherent optimism currently surrounding AI investments, a slight positive bias is assumed.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The news focuses on a competitor in the AI space, but Apple's business is not directly threatened by xAI's app. Apple has its own AI initiatives and is a much larger company with diverse revenue streams. Therefore, the probability of a stock price increase or decrease due to this news is very low. Any market movement would likely be due to broader market factors rather than this specific announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is a player in the tech industry and AI space, this particular news does not have a direct impact on Apple's business operations, products, or competitive positioning. Therefore, it is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price. The probabilities reflect minimal expected impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Elon Musk's xAI launching a stand-alone Grok app is related to a competitor in the AI space, not directly to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price is unlikely to be directly affected by this news as it pertains more to the competitive landscape of AI startups rather than Apple's core business or recent announcements. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of significant stock price movement due to this news. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is roughly equal, with a slight bias towards stability, but given the indirect nature, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to a fall due to potential concerns about competition in AI, although this is speculative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Gained 30% Last Year' suggests a positive trend for Apple's stock, indicating that investors are optimistic about the company's future growth prospects. The statement 'Investors are plowing into this popular name in anticipation of its next long-lived growth run' further reinforces this optimism, implying that there is a strong expectation of continued success and growth for Apple. This positive sentiment can drive up the stock price as more investors become interested in buying the stock. Therefore, based on this news, it is more likely that the stock price will rise rather than fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a strong past performance with a 30% gain for Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the last year, suggesting continued investor interest. The phrase 'next long-lived growth run' implies future positive expectations, which can typically bolster investment sentiment. Given the bullish context, it's likely that current investors would maintain their positions and attract new investments, thus reducing the likelihood of selling pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
