While this suggests an ongoing battle in innovation, it does not inherently favor Apple over Microsoft or vice versa. Market interest in AI could benefit both companies, but the competitive framing may create pressure on Apple's stock to outperform Microsoft. Thus, the impact could be neutral in the short term, increasing prospects of volatility rather than a clear directional move. Given that the article does not provide a definitive advantage to either party, I estimate the probabilities to be evenly split.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple vs. Microsoft: Which Is the Better Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
