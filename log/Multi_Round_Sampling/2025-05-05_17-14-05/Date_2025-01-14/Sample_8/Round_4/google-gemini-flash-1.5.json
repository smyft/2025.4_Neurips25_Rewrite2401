(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, historical performance, and new opportunities in services and AI. Despite acknowledging that aggressive investors might find better growth elsewhere, the overall tone remains positive regarding Apple's potential for continued growth and the strength of its competitive advantage. This leads to a higher probability that the stock price will rise, especially considering its recent performance and innovations. However, the mention of other stocks performing better could introduce some cautious sentiment among investors, but not enough to override the overall positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article, while about the race to $5 trillion, doesn't focus on specific immediate catalysts for Apple's stock. It notes that Apple's Services are growing but its physical device sales have stagnated, and its stock is already at a high valuation, limiting upside. While it doesn't explicitly predict a fall for Apple, it certainly doesn't offer a reason for a significant near-term rise spurred by the information in the article. The article does mention a *Double Down* recommendation's past success with Apple. However, this is generalized marketing from the Motley Fool and doesn't contribute to a specific positive outlook based on current circumstances. Therefore, it is unlikely there is any significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news that Apple will begin using semiconductors manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is generally positive for Apple.  This reduces Apple's reliance on Taiwan for chip production, mitigating geopolitical and natural disaster risks.  While the news doesn't represent an immediate impact on Apple's financials,  it signifies a long-term strategic advantage, enhancing supply chain resilience and potentially lowering costs in the future. However, the initial production is still subject to testing and potential setbacks, and the fact that packaging is still being done in Taiwan introduces a degree of uncertainty.  Therefore, while the overall sentiment is positive, there's a small probability of negative reaction due to temporary challenges or market overreaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is quite generic and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple is not traditionally classified as a luxury stock, although some of its products like the iPhone and MacBook are considered premium. Without more context or details linking Apple directly to luxury investments, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely neutral or minimal. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are balanced and low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's Q1 results may face challenges despite a forecasted 4% revenue growth. The analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, indicating his skepticism about the stock's near-term performance. He highlights several challenges, including the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. Additionally, he notes that Apple's guidance might not meet market expectations, even if it aligns with Wall Street's earnings projections. These factors could negatively impact the stock price. However, the 4% revenue growth forecast and the progress over last year's performance might provide some support for the stock price. Considering these points, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is neutral and does not provide any specific information about the company's performance or future prospects. It is more of an invitation to consider buying the stock rather than a report of a significant event that could impact the stock price. Given the lack of concrete information, the news is unlikely to significantly move the stock price in either direction.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance as a dividend stock with a robust cash position and a track record of consistent dividend payments. The company's strong revenue growth and favorable market conditions support continued investor optimism. However, there is a mention of AI stocks having greater potential for higher returns, which might influence some\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u7bc7\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5230\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u5206\u7ea2\u80a1\u7968\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6d3e\u606f\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6709\u5229\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4e50\u89c2\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u4e5f\u63d0\u5230AI\u80a1\u7968\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong market position, historical performance, and potential for future growth, particularly with its expansion into AI and services revenue. Despite some cautious sentiment due to competition and potential for better growth in other tech stocks, the overall tone remains positive regarding Apple's resilience and ability to generate profits. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, but the majority lean towards a rise in stock price, accounting for Apple's continued dominance in the tech industry and innovations. Thus, I predict a higher probability of stock price rising given the prevailing optimism and potential for sustained growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses the race to a $5 trillion valuation, suggesting Amazon is the most likely candidate, not Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple. It mentions Apple's stagnating device sales and high valuation as potential limitations. While the article doesn't directly predict a fall in Apple's stock, it doesn't provide a strong catalyst for an immediate price increase. However, given Apple's overall financial health and brand strength, also considering the diversity of previous predictions, a slight upward movement is more likely than a sharp fall. The previous rounds varied on their predictions showing mixed feelings about the prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple using Arizona-made chips from TSMC in Q1 2025 is a positive long-term strategic move.  It reduces reliance on Taiwan, mitigating geopolitical and disaster risks. However, the impact on the stock price is likely to be muted in the short-term.  The news is not a near-term catalyst; the actual impact on costs and production will be realized much later. The ongoing packaging in Taiwan also suggests the benefits aren't fully realized yet. While the long-term strategic implications are positive, the short-term market reaction is likely to be muted, with some potential for a small positive price movement due to the positive long-term implications but it is unlikely to be substantial. Considering the previous predictions showing a wide range of probabilities, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the strategic value, but acknowledge the uncertainty of short-term market reaction.  The fact that other companies are also using the Arizona facility suggests it is not a unique advantage only for Apple in the near term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is generic and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is not traditionally classified as a luxury stock, some of its products are considered premium. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, with some models leaning positive due to Apple's strong market position and others neutral or negative due to lack of immediate catalysts or high valuation. The lack of concrete news specific to Apple suggests minimal impact on its stock price. However, considering Apple's historical resilience and overall market sentiment, a slight positive bias is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's Q1 results may face challenges despite a forecasted 4% revenue growth. The analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, indicating his skepticism about the stock's near-term performance. He highlights several challenges, including the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. Additionally, he notes that Apple's guidance might not meet market expectations, even if it aligns with Wall Street's earnings projections. These factors could negatively impact the stock price. However, the 4% revenue growth forecast and the progress over last year's performance might provide some support for the stock price. Considering these points, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not provide specific information about Apple's current performance or future prospects. However, considering the previous predictions from various models, there seems to be a mixed sentiment. Some models are positive about Apple's potential for growth, citing its strong market position and historical performance, while others are more cautious due to the lack of immediate catalysts for significant stock price movement and potential challenges such as stagnated device sales and high valuation. Given the neutral nature of the headline and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I will estimate the probabilities based on the general perception of Apple's stability and growth potential without specific positive or negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance as a dividend stock with a robust cash position and a track record of consistent dividend payments. The company's strong revenue growth and favorable market conditions support continued investor optimism. Multiple models have indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising, emphasizing its consistent dividend payments, strong market position, and new technological advancements. Although there are concerns about the potential for higher returns from AI stocks, the overall positive tone and strong fundamentals suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's strong historical performance, market dominance, and potential growth in services and AI. It highlights Apple's significant competitive advantage, which suggests positive long-term prospects. However, some analysts express concerns about stagnating device sales and potential challenges in the short term. The overall sentiment from previous predictions shows a leaning toward optimism regarding Apple's growth potential. Based on this analysis, I estimate a higher probability of stock price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The article discusses the race to a $5 trillion valuation and posits that Amazon is more likely to reach that milestone first, not Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple. It notes stagnation in Apple's device sales and its high valuation as potential impediments to rapid growth. While the article doesn't directly forecast a decline in Apple's stock value, it lacks any specific positive catalysts for a substantial price increase. The mixed sentiments from previous rounds showed that there are diverse opinions, and there is not a clear positive outlook. Given Apple's overall stability, robust brand, and mixed previous predictions, I am leaning slightly towards a more neutral outcome with a slight positive tilt.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple using Arizona-made chips in 2025 is a positive long-term strategic move, reducing reliance on Taiwan and mitigating geopolitical risks. However, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal in the short-term.  The benefits are not immediate;  the actual impact on costs and production is years away. The fact that packaging remains in Taiwan further limits near-term benefits.  While the long-term strategic implications are positive, the short-term market reaction is expected to be muted.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty.  Considering the strategic value and the generally positive sentiment towards Apple, a slightly higher probability for a price rise is reasonable, but the effect is unlikely to be dramatic.  The news lacks an immediate impact catalyst.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is somewhat generic and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple's products are often considered premium, they are not traditionally classified as luxury items. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment. Some models lean positively based on Apple's strong market position and historical performance, while others remain neutral or slightly negative due to lack of immediate catalysts or high valuation. The lack of concrete news specific to Apple suggests minimal impact on its stock price. However, considering Apple's historical resilience and overall market sentiment, a slight positive bias is reasonable. Based on the mixed sentiments and the neutral nature of the news, I estimate a balanced probability with a slight lean towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided financial news discusses Apple's Q1 results and highlights several challenges, including a forecasted 4% revenue growth, the absence of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. Analyst Brandon Nispel maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, indicating skepticism about the stock's near-term performance. Despite these challenges, the 4% revenue growth forecast and progress over last year's performance might provide some support for the stock price. Considering the mixed sentiments from previous predictions and the current news, there is a cautious outlook but with a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the highlighted challenges and analyst's 'underweight' rating.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not provide specific information about Apple's current performance or future prospects.

Apple's strong market position, historical performance, and potential for future growth, particularly with its expansion into AI and services revenue, contribute to a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance as a dividend stock with a robust cash position and a track record of consistent dividend payments. The company's strong revenue growth and favorable market conditions support continued investor optimism. Multiple models have indicated a higher probability of the stock price rising, emphasizing its consistent dividend payments, strong market position, and new technological advancements. Although there are concerns about the potential for higher returns from AI stocks, the overall positive tone and strong fundamentals suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, some cautionary sentiments and external factors like competition may introduce a small degree of uncertainty.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong market dominance, substantial historical performance, and notable potential for growth through services and AI integration. However, some models express caution regarding market challenges, including stagnating device sales and high valuations. Despite these concerns, the overall consensus leans toward a positive outlook due to Apple's robust competitive advantages and consistent performance as a dividend stock, suggesting that the probabilities of the stock price rising are higher than those of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article discusses the race to a $5 trillion valuation, favoring Amazon over Apple. It points to Apple's stagnating device sales and high valuation as potential obstacles. While there are no immediate catalysts for a significant price increase, Apple's robust brand and overall stability suggest it won't fall sharply. Considering the mixed sentiment from prior predictions, there is a cautious optimistic outlook and a potential for long term increase in the presence of mixed short term signals, a slight positive tilt is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news about Apple using domestically produced chips from TSMC's Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is a positive long-term development.  It reduces reliance on Taiwan, mitigating geopolitical and natural disaster risks, and potentially improving supply chain efficiency and cost in the future. However, the impact on the stock price is likely muted in the short term. The benefits are not immediate; the actual impact on costs and production won't be felt for several quarters.  The continued reliance on Taiwan for packaging further dilutes any immediate positive impact.  The previous predictions showcase a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news's immediate market impact.  Considering the long-term strategic advantages, Apple's overall strong financial health, and a slight upward trend in predictions across rounds, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, acknowledging the lack of a significant near-term catalyst. The fact that other companies are also using this facility also reduces the magnitude of the positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is generic and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.
