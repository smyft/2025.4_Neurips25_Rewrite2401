(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline relates to luxury stocks, and while Apple Inc. is not exclusively categorized strictly as a luxury brand, it is often considered premium due to its higher-priced products and brand positioning. The general trend towards luxury goods can be interpreted positively for Apple, suggesting that consumers may be willing to spend more on non-essential items, potentially benefiting Apple's sales. However, without specific indicators of performance related to Apple or recent market conditions, the impact is hard to quantify. Thus, a moderate probability of stock price increase is assigned, with a lower probability of a decrease in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its market dominance, strong competitive advantages, and potential for future growth through services and AI. While acknowledging that Apple's growth might not be as explosive as younger companies, it suggests the stock is still a compelling buy for most investors due to its established moat and new growth opportunities. The mention of a Motley Fool stock advisor's negative view of AAPL and their higher recommendation for NVDA should be considered but is only a single negative data point relative to numerous arguments in favor of AAPL at the present time. Weighing the positive assessment against this negative input suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase, but the degree should not be considered particularly high, as the analysis is limited and forward-looking.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news that Apple will begin using semiconductors manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is generally positive for Apple.  Reducing reliance on Taiwan for chip production mitigates geopolitical and natural disaster risks, enhancing supply chain security. This is a long-term positive for Apple, potentially improving margins and reducing production uncertainty. However, the news is not a short-term catalyst. The impact is likely gradual and spread over time as Arizona production ramps up.  The initial production in Q1 2025 is a milestone, but mass production must be successful for significant impact on Apple's stock price.  There's also inherent risk associated with any large-scale production shift, including potential manufacturing delays or quality issues. The market might have already partially priced in this positive development, limiting the immediate price appreciation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, there is a projected 4% revenue growth for the December quarter, which aligns with Wall Street's expectations. However, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target, citing several challenges: lack of an AI-driven update cycle, iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, competitive pressures in China, and potential demand cannibalization by the iPhone SE. Additionally, growth in other product categories like iPads, Macs, and wearables is described as limited. Given the cautious outlook and the analyst's warning about unmet market expectations, the negative factors appear to outweigh the positive revenue growth projection.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in regaining market share in 2025, particularly due to its underwhelming upgrades and competition from Chinese Android device makers. The company's lack of AI availability in China has hindered its performance in the region. However, the new US regulations on AI chip exports may benefit Apple in the long run by limiting China's access to advanced AI technology. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately low due to the current challenges faced by the company, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher due to the intense competition and lack of AI availability in key markets.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' does not provide specific details on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Without additional context on how this general news specifically relates to Apple, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction about the stock price movement. The news could have varying impacts depending on additional factors such as economic conditions, market sentiment, or specific industry developments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' indicates a trend that may favor high-end brands, including Apple, due to its premium positioning. Previous predictions show a general belief that Apple could benefit from consumer spending on luxury items, contributing to an optimistic outlook. However, the overall market sentiment is mixed, with some analysts citing competitive pressures and internal challenges that might affect growth. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower, but still significant probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article presents a fairly balanced view of Apple. It highlights Apple's strengths: market leadership, strong competitive advantages, and the potential for future growth through services and AI, particularly with Apple Intelligence. However, it also acknowledges that Apple's growth may not be as explosive as younger, more focused companies. A key point is the suggestion that aggressive investors may find better opportunities elsewhere. The ending mention of a different Motley Fool analysis recommending against buying Apple, in favor of other stocks with 'monster returns,' tempers the enthusiasm significantly. Considering the positive factors and the negative alternative investment options, I will adjust my rise probability from the previous round's average slightly downward. The article gives both pros and cons toward AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple using Arizona-made chips from TSMC in Q1 2025 is a long-term positive.  Reducing reliance on Taiwan improves supply chain resilience against geopolitical risks and natural disasters. This is a strategic move that could positively impact Apple's margins and operational efficiency over time. However, the impact on stock price is unlikely to be immediate or dramatic. The market may have already partially priced in this development, and the success of mass production in Arizona remains uncertain.  Initial production is just a milestone; significant impact depends on successful mass production without setbacks.  Furthermore, the short-term market sentiment and other factors unrelated to this news will significantly influence Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions exhibiting a range of opinions and the long-term nature of this news, a moderate probability of a price increase is assigned, acknowledging the potential for no significant short-term change or even a slight negative reaction if other news dominates.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is a projected 4% revenue growth for the December quarter, which aligns with Wall Street's expectations. However, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target, citing several challenges including the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, competitive pressures in China, and potential demand cannibalization by the iPhone SE. Additionally, growth in other product categories like iPads, Macs, and wearables is described as limited. Given the cautious outlook and the analyst's warning about unmet market expectations, the negative factors appear to outweigh the positive revenue growth projection. Previous predictions also show a trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Apple's struggle to regain market share in 2025 and the potential impact of AI on its performance. The article highlights Apple's underwhelming upgrades, competition from Chinese Android device makers, and the lack of AI availability in China. However, new US regulations on AI chip exports may benefit Apple in the long run by limiting China's access to advanced AI technology. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately low due to the current challenges faced by the company, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher due to the intense competition and lack of AI availability in key markets.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggle to regain market share in 2025 due to underwhelming upgrades and competition from Chinese Android device makers. The lack of AI availability in China has hindered Apple's performance in the region. However, the new US regulations on AI chip exports may benefit Apple in the long run by limiting China's access to advanced AI technology. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is moderately low due to the current challenges faced by the company, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher due to the intense competition and lack of AI availability in key markets. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there is a trend towards a lower probability of stock price rise and a higher probability of stock price fall as more information about the company's challenges and the impact of the US regulations becomes available.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' implies a general positive trend towards luxury consumer goods. Apple Inc., despite not being strictly categorized as a luxury brand, often holds a premium position due to its higher-priced products and strong brand value. The analysis from previous predictions indicates mixed opinions, reflecting both positive aspects like growth projections and new technological shifts versus challenges such as competition, market share loss, and lack of AI availability. Considering the mixed signals and the limited specifics provided, it's prudent to assign probabilities that align with a somewhat cautious stance.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
