(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges Apple Inc. is facing, particularly its declining market share in the wake of increased competition from Android manufacturers. Moreover, the restrictions on AI technology exports could impact its ability to innovate and regain market share. While there is potential for AI advancements, which could benefit AAPL in the long run, the immediate sentiment seems to lean negative due to current hurdles. Thus, the likelihood of a price rise is lower than that of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is quite general. While Apple products are often considered premium and therefore somewhat luxury-oriented, the connection isn't direct and the impact of this news on Apple's stock is questionable. The impact on Apple depends on where the Apple actually has luxury items. Without specific details about Apple's plans to significantly expand its luxury offerings or whether analysts already view Apple as part of that market segment increases the uncertainty. If Apple's product positioning strategy significantly changes to increase its foothold with high end luxury products then positive market movement is more assured. If there are no significant changes, it is more likely Apple's products will be seen as only 'luxury-esque', so no significant market movements are likely. Consequently, a neutral to slightly positive probability is assigned for the rise, and a slightly higher likelihood for a fall/neutral reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?\", is extremely vague and offers no actionable information regarding Apple's financial performance, prospects, or any specific events.  It's a generic clickbait headline that doesn't provide any basis for predicting stock price movement.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is negligible. The probabilities should reflect the inherent volatility and market forces, independent of this headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, though it suggests Amazon (AMZN) as a more likely candidate due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high current valuation as potential hurdles, while also noting the broader context of AI-driven market dynamics and historical tech bubbles. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term potential but near-term valuation concerns\u2014the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The article does not present any immediate negative catalysts for Apple, but the high valuation could limit upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple's plan to use chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab, set to launch in Q1 2025, is generally positive for Apple Inc. (AAPL). This development indicates a strategic move towards diversifying and securing Apple's supply chain, particularly by reducing reliance on Taiwan and mitigating risks associated with geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. Additionally, this step aligns with the U.S.'s goal of enhancing semiconductor independence. While there might be short-term challenges or costs associated with this transition, the long-term benefits of a more resilient supply chain and potential cost savings could outweigh these. Therefore, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article suggests that Amazon has a clear path to becoming the first $5 trillion company on Wall Street, surpassing Nvidia and other tech giants. The reasoning behind this prediction is that Amazon's growth potential comes from its ancillary operating segments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services, which are less reliant on the AI bubble. Additionally, Amazon's valuation is considered historically inexpensive, with a price-to-cash-flow ratio of 13.5, which is lower than its median year-end multiple to cash flow from 2010 to 2019. This analysis implies that Amazon's stock price is likely to rise due to its diverse revenue streams and relatively low valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance as a dividend stock with a robust cash position and a track record of consistent dividend payments. The company's strong revenue growth and favorable market conditions support continued investor optimism. However, there is a mention of AI stocks having greater potential for higher returns, which might influence some\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u7bc7\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5230\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u5206\u7ea2\u80a1\u7968\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6d3e\u606f\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6709\u5229\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4e50\u89c2\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u4e5f\u63d0\u5230AI\u80a1\u7968\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is facing challenges, particularly a decline in market share and increased competition from Android manufacturers. The new U.S. export restrictions on AI technology may hinder Apple's ability to innovate in the AI space, which is critical for regaining market share. While there is some potential for AI advancements to benefit Apple in the long run, the immediate sentiment is negative due to its current struggles and the ineffective introduction of its AI updates in key markets like China. This leads to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is very general and provides little concrete information about Apple. Previous models' predictions varied significantly, with a slight tendency towards neutral or negative. However, some models found the news to be unrelated or too generic to affect the stock price. Considering the vague headline and the lack of specific information about Apple in the context of 'luxury stocks', I assess that the impact will be minimal. There are some minor associations with Apple as a luxury-esque brand but if the company will shift marketing stragegies to focus more on luxury then the prediction probability should be higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is extremely vague and provides no information relevant to Apple's stock price movement.  The previous predictions are based on various news sources and analyses, each with different perspectives, resulting in a wide range of probabilities.  Several models correctly note the lack of actionable information in the headline itself, giving probabilities around 0.5, which is a neutral position.  However, considering the overall sentiment expressed within the prior models (leaning slightly negative given concerns about competition and valuation), a slightly conservative estimate is preferred \u2013 still reflecting the inherent volatility and market forces independent of the news.  The collective reasoning suggests that while positive news could influence the stock, the lack of specific positive information means the likelihood of dramatic rises is low. A slight bias toward a fall or neutral position is observed across the various analyses.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company but suggests that Amazon (AMZN) is a more likely candidate due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high current valuation as potential hurdles, while also noting the broader context of AI-driven market dynamics and historical tech bubbles. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term potential but near-term valuation concerns\u2014the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The article does not present any immediate negative catalysts for Apple, but the high valuation could limit upside. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this uncertainty, with probabilities ranging from neutral to slightly positive or negative. Considering the overall sentiment and the lack of immediate positive catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, but suggests Amazon as a more likely candidate. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high current valuation as potential hurdles. Considering the mixed signals and the analysis provided by other models, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than that of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance as a dividend stock with a robust cash position and a track record of consistent dividend payments. The company's strong revenue growth and favorable market conditions support continued investor optimism. Despite some predictions indicating potential for higher returns from AI stocks, the article emphasizes Apple's strong position as a safe dividend stock. Hedge funds holding Apple's stock have increased, further supporting the attractiveness of the stock as a safe investment option. The overall sentiment leans towards positivity, especially regarding the long-term stability offered by dividend stocks.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights significant challenges faced by Apple Inc., particularly its decline in market share and heightened competition from Android manufacturers, which diminishes investor sentiment. Additionally, the new U.S. export restrictions on AI technology could adversely affect Apple's ability to innovate and recover its position in the AI sector. While the potential for AI advancements exists, the immediate outlook remains negative due to current hurdles, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline compared to an increase. The previous predictions have generally indicated a lean towards a fall, which informs this estimation.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.53, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is still vague and doesn't provide specific details about Apple's involvement or plans in the luxury market. Previous rounds show varied predictions. Some models consider Apple a luxury-esque brand, while others dismiss the headline as too generic. The general trend in previous predictions seems to lean slightly negative or neutral. The fact that several models from round 0 were re-used in round 1, many with nearly identical predictions, suggests the information environment hasn't significantly changed this is likely because the headline remains unchanged. Therefore, while an indirect association exists, the lack of concrete information about Apple's strategy or a direct link to luxury markets makes a significant price movement unlikely. I will give a slight positive estimation towards rising because of the slightly positive predictions from two of the models in the previous round but also will decrease their value due to the slightly negetive trend. Therefore, the price will rise slightly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is extremely vague and provides no actionable information.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price movement based solely on this headline.  Early predictions leaned slightly negative due to concerns about competition and Apple's valuation, but some models found the news unrelated to stock price. The lack of specific information means no dramatic movements are likely.  The collective reasoning of previous models suggests that while positive news could influence the stock, the likelihood of a dramatic rise is low; the current situation suggests a slightly higher probability of a relatively small price fall than a small price rise due to the lack of positive catalysts from the headline itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company but suggests that Amazon (AMZN) is a more likely candidate due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high current valuation as potential hurdles, while also noting the broader context of AI-driven market dynamics and historical tech bubbles. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term potential but near-term valuation concerns\u2014the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The article does not present any immediate negative catalysts for Apple, but the high valuation could limit upside. Previous predictions from other models also reflect this uncertainty, with probabilities ranging from neutral to slightly positive or negative. Considering the overall sentiment and the lack of immediate positive catalysts, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than that of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's plan to use chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab, set to launch in Q1 2025. This development indicates a strategic move towards diversifying and securing Apple's supply chain, particularly by reducing reliance on Taiwan and mitigating risks associated with geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. The Arizona facility is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains, and other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia are also doing test production there. This move aligns with the U.S.'s goal of enhancing semiconductor independence and could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price in the long term. However, there might be short-term challenges or costs associated with this transition. Considering the overall positive sentiment and the strategic benefits for Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a company to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, with Amazon being a more likely candidate than Apple due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high current valuation as potential hurdles. Considering the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term potential but near-term valuation concerns\u2014the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain.
