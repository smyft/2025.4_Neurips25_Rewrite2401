(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges Apple Inc. is facing, particularly its declining market share in the wake of increased competition from Android manufacturers. Moreover, the restrictions on AI technology exports could impact its ability to innovate and regain market share. While there is potential for AI advancements, which could benefit AAPL in the long run, the immediate sentiment seems to lean negative due to current hurdles. Thus, the likelihood of a price rise is lower than that of a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is quite general. While Apple products are often considered premium and therefore somewhat luxury-oriented, the connection isn't direct and the impact of this news on Apple's stock is questionable. The impact on Apple depends on where the Apple actually has luxury items. Without specific details about Apple's plans to significantly expand its luxury offerings or whether analysts already view Apple as part of that market segment increases the uncertainty. If Apple's product positioning strategy significantly changes to increase its foothold with high end luxury products then positive market movement is more assured. If there are no significant changes, it is more likely Apple's products will be seen as only 'luxury-esque', so no significant market movements are likely. Consequently, a neutral to slightly positive probability is assigned for the rise, and a slightly higher likelihood for a fall/neutral reaction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?\", is extremely vague and offers no actionable information regarding Apple's financial performance, prospects, or any specific events.  It's a generic clickbait headline that doesn't provide any basis for predicting stock price movement.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is negligible. The probabilities should reflect the inherent volatility and market forces, independent of this headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, though it suggests Amazon (AMZN) as a more likely candidate due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high current valuation as potential hurdles, while also noting the broader context of AI-driven market dynamics and historical tech bubbles. Given the mixed signals\u2014positive long-term potential but near-term valuation concerns\u2014the impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The article does not present any immediate negative catalysts for Apple, but the high valuation could limit upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple's plan to use chips manufactured at TSMC's Arizona fab, set to launch in Q1 2025, is generally positive for Apple Inc. (AAPL). This development indicates a strategic move towards diversifying and securing Apple's supply chain, particularly by reducing reliance on Taiwan and mitigating risks associated with geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. Additionally, this step aligns with the U.S.'s goal of enhancing semiconductor independence. While there might be short-term challenges or costs associated with this transition, the long-term benefits of a more resilient supply chain and potential cost savings could outweigh these. Therefore, the news is likely to be viewed positively by investors, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article suggests that Amazon has a clear path to becoming the first $5 trillion company on Wall Street, surpassing Nvidia and other tech giants. The reasoning behind this prediction is that Amazon's growth potential comes from its ancillary operating segments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services, which are less reliant on the AI bubble. Additionally, Amazon's valuation is considered historically inexpensive, with a price-to-cash-flow ratio of 13.5, which is lower than its median year-end multiple to cash flow from 2010 to 2019. This analysis implies that Amazon's stock price is likely to rise due to its diverse revenue streams and relatively low valuation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong performance as a dividend stock with a robust cash position and a track record of consistent dividend payments. The company's strong revenue growth and favorable market conditions support continued investor optimism. However, there is a mention of AI stocks having greater potential for higher returns, which might influence some\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u7bc7\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5230\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u5206\u7ea2\u80a1\u7968\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6d3e\u606f\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6709\u5229\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4e50\u89c2\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u4e5f\u63d0\u5230AI\u80a1\u7968\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
