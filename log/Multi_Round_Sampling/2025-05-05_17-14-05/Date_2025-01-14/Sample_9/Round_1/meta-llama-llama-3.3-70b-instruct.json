(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Company -- and It's Not Nvidia\nNews Content: Change is perhaps the only certainty on Wall Street. Due to factors such as innovation, competition, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and legal judgments, the puzzle pieces that make up the largest publicly traded companies are constantly in flux.\n\nWhen 2004 came to a close, ExxonMobil was the largest publicly traded company in the S&P 500, with Citigroup and General Electric also in the top 10. Today, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the only member of the end-of-2004 top 10 that's still among America's largest publicly traded companies.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2023, we've witnessed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all surpass the $3 trillion valuation plateau. Although Nvidia would seem like the surest bet to reach the psychologically important $5 trillion level given the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a dark-horse candidate may have the clearest path to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nNvidia is battling against history, which has a flawless track record\n\nOn one hand, there's no denying that Nvidia has enjoyed a textbook operating expansion. The company's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their high-compute data centers.\n\nWith demand for GPUs overwhelming supply, Nvidia has been able to command $30,000 to $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU. Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidia's gross margin to as high as 78.4% last year.\n\nWhile the long-term outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has real-world applications in most industries around the globe, Nvidia's chances of becoming Wall Street's first $5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers. Though the internet did, eventually, alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way, it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels.\n\nIncluding the internet, every game-changing technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology/innovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility. With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how they'll maximize the return on their AI investments, it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia, the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest. Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a $5 trillion valuation first.Image source: Amazon.\n\nThis dark-horse candidate has a clear path to become America's largest public company\n\nIf history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts, it would also be bad news for Microsoft, which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligence-driven future. Although Microsoft's operating cash flow isn't as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia, being the first to reach a $5 trillion valuation would be a stretch.\n\nThe same can be said for Wall Street's other $3 trillion public company, Apple. Though Apple's Services segment continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, its physical device sales, including iPhone, have stagnated for two years. Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade, which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another $1.4 trillion.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" component that appears to have the clearest path to a $5 trillion market cap is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhen most consumers and investors hear the Amazon name, they think of its dominant online marketplace. Last February, eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2024. While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades, e-commerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income.\n\nThe lion's share of Amazon's growth potential (specifically growth in cash flow) originates from its ancillary operating segments, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) at the front of the pack.\n\nBased on data from tech-analysis firm Canalys, AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 33% share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024. For context, Amazon's share of spending among cloud-service providers is more than Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, combined \u2014 and these are the No's 2 and 3 in global cloud-service spending.\n\nEven though AI has played a role in AWS's growth, enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady double-digit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. With enterprise cloud-service spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion, Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon's advertising services and subscription services (e.g., Prime) segments are also respectively growing by double digits. Amazon's push into exclusive sporting events (Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages) should improve demand for advertising, as well as support its subscription pricing power.\n\nThe key point is that, unlike Microsoft and Nvidia, Amazon wouldn't be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts.\n\nLastly, Amazon remains historically inexpensive. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of the company. But as of the closing bell on Jan. 10, Amazon's shares are valued at just 13.5 times consensus cash flow for 2026. If Amazon were to reach the median year-end multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019, it would become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a top safe dividend stock for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, a significant cash flow, and positive sentiment among hedge funds. AAPL's solid revenue growth and robust market presence suggest stability and potential for sustained growth. Additionally, historical trends indicate that dividend stocks tend to outperform in various market cycles, which could attract more investors seeking security in uncertain times. However, market volatility driven by external factors remains a concern, leading to some uncertainty in stock price movement. Therefore, there is a higher probability of stock price rise than fall, but the market's nature suggests neither outcome can be ruled out completely.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its market dominance, strong competitive advantages, and potential for future growth through services and AI. While acknowledging that Apple's growth might not be as explosive as younger companies, it suggests the stock is still a compelling buy for most investors due to its established moat and new growth opportunities. The mention of a Motley Fool stock advisor's negative view of AAPL and their higher recommendation for NVDA should be considered but is only a single negative data point relative to numerous arguments in favor of AAPL at the present time. Weighing the positive assessment against this negative input suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase, but the degree should not be considered particularly high, as the analysis is limited and forward-looking.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is projected to meet Wall Street earnings expectations with a 4% revenue increase, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and a price target significantly below the current market price.  This suggests the analyst believes the market is overvaluing Apple.  Concerns about iPhone sales due to the Indonesian ban, competition in China, the lack of a significant AI-driven update, potential lower demand for iPhone 16 due to iPhone SE, and limited growth in other product segments all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Although the 4% revenue growth is positive, it's not enough to outweigh the negative factors highlighted by the analyst, particularly given his established bearish stance.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it moves towards semiconductor independence by sourcing chips from TSMC's Arizona fab, reducing reliance on Taiwan. This is a positive step for supply chain resilience and geopolitical risk mitigation, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The involvement of other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia in the Arizona fab also adds credibility to the initiative. However, the actual impact on Apple's stock price may be tempered by the fact that mass production is not expected until Q1 2025, and there are still logistical challenges (e.g., packaging in Taiwan until the Peoria facility is complete). Overall, the news is more likely to have a positive than negative impact on AAPL's stock price in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to AI technology and its impact on the company's market share. The US government's new restrictions on AI chip exports, particularly to China, could potentially impact Apple's supply chain and competitive position. However, the article also mentions Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, which could help the company regain market share in 2025. The mixed response to the iPhone 16 series and the company's reliance on partnerships with local players in China to provide AI features may affect its performance. Given these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.55, as Apple's efforts in AI and potential partnerships could help mitigate its current struggles. Conversely, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated at 0.45, as the company faces significant competition and challenges in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, with Amazon being considered a dark-horse candidate. The article highlights Amazon's diverse revenue streams, including its cloud services, advertising, and subscription services, which could drive growth and increase its valuation. In contrast, Nvidia's reliance on the AI bubble and potential for a burst makes it less likely to reach the $5 trillion mark first. Meanwhile, Apple's stagnating physical device sales and high current valuation also make it less likely to reach the $5 trillion mark. Given this analysis, the probability of Amazon's stock price rising is higher than that of Nvidia or Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong competitive advantage, robust revenue generation, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new frontiers such as AI and services. The content emphasizes the company's potential for continued growth, which may appeal to both conservative and long-term investors. Given the positive tone and the strong fundamentals presented, it is likely that this news will positively influence investor sentiment.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
