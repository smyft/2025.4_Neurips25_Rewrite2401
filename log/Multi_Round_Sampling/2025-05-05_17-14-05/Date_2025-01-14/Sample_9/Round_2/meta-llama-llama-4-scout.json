(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's position as a top safe dividend stock for 2025, emphasizing its strong financial performance, a significant cash flow, and positive sentiment among hedge funds. AAPL's solid revenue growth and robust market presence suggest stability and potential for sustained growth. Additionally, historical trends indicate that dividend stocks tend to outperform in various market cycles, which could attract more investors seeking security in uncertain times. However, market volatility driven by external factors remains a concern, leading to some uncertainty in stock price movement. Therefore, there is a higher probability of stock price rise than fall, but the market's nature suggests neither outcome can be ruled out completely.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its market dominance, strong competitive advantages, and potential for future growth through services and AI. While acknowledging that Apple's growth might not be as explosive as younger companies, it suggests the stock is still a compelling buy for most investors due to its established moat and new growth opportunities. The mention of a Motley Fool stock advisor's negative view of AAPL and their higher recommendation for NVDA should be considered but is only a single negative data point relative to numerous arguments in favor of AAPL at the present time. Weighing the positive assessment against this negative input suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase, but the degree should not be considered particularly high, as the analysis is limited and forward-looking.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is projected to meet Wall Street earnings expectations with a 4% revenue increase, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and a price target significantly below the current market price.  This suggests the analyst believes the market is overvaluing Apple.  Concerns about iPhone sales due to the Indonesian ban, competition in China, the lack of a significant AI-driven update, potential lower demand for iPhone 16 due to iPhone SE, and limited growth in other product segments all contribute to a pessimistic outlook. Although the 4% revenue growth is positive, it's not enough to outweigh the negative factors highlighted by the analyst, particularly given his established bearish stance.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it moves towards semiconductor independence by sourcing chips from TSMC's Arizona fab, reducing reliance on Taiwan. This is a positive step for supply chain resilience and geopolitical risk mitigation, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The involvement of other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia in the Arizona fab also adds credibility to the initiative. However, the actual impact on Apple's stock price may be tempered by the fact that mass production is not expected until Q1 2025, and there are still logistical challenges (e.g., packaging in Taiwan until the Peoria facility is complete). Overall, the news is more likely to have a positive than negative impact on AAPL's stock price in the short to medium term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to AI technology and its impact on the company's market share. The US government's new restrictions on AI chip exports, particularly to China, could potentially impact Apple's supply chain and competitive position. However, the article also mentions Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, which could help the company regain market share in 2025. The mixed response to the iPhone 16 series and the company's reliance on partnerships with local players in China to provide AI features may affect its performance. Given these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.55, as Apple's efforts in AI and potential partnerships could help mitigate its current struggles. Conversely, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated at 0.45, as the company faces significant competition and challenges in the AI space.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, with Amazon being considered a dark-horse candidate. The article highlights Amazon's diverse revenue streams, including its cloud services, advertising, and subscription services, which could drive growth and increase its valuation. In contrast, Nvidia's reliance on the AI bubble and potential for a burst makes it less likely to reach the $5 trillion mark first. Meanwhile, Apple's stagnating physical device sales and high current valuation also make it less likely to reach the $5 trillion mark. Given this analysis, the probability of Amazon's stock price rising is higher than that of Nvidia or Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong competitive advantage, robust revenue generation, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new frontiers such as AI and services. The content emphasizes the company's potential for continued growth, which may appeal to both conservative and long-term investors. Given the positive tone and the strong fundamentals presented, it is likely that this news will positively influence investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a favorable view of Apple Inc. as a leading dividend stock, highlighting its strong financial performance, sustainable payout ratio, and growth potential in AI and services. The analysis of historical trends shows that dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform in various market conditions, suggesting stability for AAPL. Moreover, the optimism around the tech sector due to recent market performance further supports a potential rise in stock prices. However, there are concerns regarding market volatility and competitive pressures that could affect AAPL negatively. Balancing these perspectives, the likelihood of the stock price rising appears to be greater than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The article presents a bullish case for Apple, highlighting its market leadership, strong moat, and growth potential in services and AI. While it acknowledges that aggressive growth investors might look elsewhere, it suggests Apple is a compelling buy for most investors. The previous round predictions show a mix of sentiment, generally leaning positive, with a few bearish outliers. Considering the overall positive tone of the article and the general positive leaning in the previous predictions, I will assign a higher probability for the stock price to rise, but not excessively so, cognizant of the caution expressed about growth-oriented investors and the alternative 'best stocks' mentioned in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a 4% revenue increase is positive and meets Wall Street expectations, the analyst's 'underweight' rating and significantly lower price target ($200) suggest a bearish sentiment.  Concerns regarding iPhone sales (Indonesia ban, potential iPhone SE impact on iPhone 16 demand), Chinese competition, and a lack of a major AI-driven update cycle overshadow the positive revenue growth.  The limited growth in iPads, Macs, and wearables further dampens the outlook. Previous predictions are varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 probability of a price rise. Considering the analyst's specific concerns and the relatively muted revenue growth compared to historical performance, the probability of a price fall appears slightly higher than a rise, though the overall uncertainty remains significant.  I also consider the trend in prior predictions, which shows some movement towards lower probability of price rise and higher probability of price fall in more recent rounds, although there is still considerable variance across models indicating high uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant positive development for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with TSMC's Arizona fab set to supply semiconductors starting Q1 2025, enhancing supply chain resilience and reducing geopolitical risks. This move is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, as it strengthens Apple's position in the semiconductor industry and mitigates reliance on Taiwan. The involvement of other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia in the Arizona fab adds credibility. However, the actual impact may be tempered by the timeline (mass production not until Q1 2025) and current logistical challenges (packaging in Taiwan). Overall, the news is more likely to have a positive than negative impact on AAPL's stock price in the short to medium term, aligning with previous predictions that lean towards a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for a company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, with Amazon being considered a dark-horse candidate. However, the company in question is Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article highlights Amazon's diverse revenue streams, but does not directly discuss Apple's potential for growth or valuation increase. Given the lack of direct discussion about Apple's prospects, the analysis of Amazon's potential does not directly apply to Apple. However, considering the general market trends and the fact that Apple is one of the companies discussed in the context of reaching a high valuation, we can infer that the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price due to its mention alongside other major tech companies. Nevertheless, the article's focus on Amazon as the dark-horse candidate for reaching a $5 trillion valuation and the concerns about Nvidia's reliance on the AI bubble might indirectly suggest that Apple's path to such a valuation is less clear or less emphasized in this context.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's position as a dominant player in the technology sector with a strong competitive advantage, substantial revenue and profits, and new growth opportunities through services and AI. Despite noting that Apple's growth may not be as explosive as newer companies like Nvidia, the overall positive sentiment and the potential for further market advancement are emphasized by multiple sources. Previous predictions show a mix of optimism and caution, but a majority trend towards a positive outlook, especially considering the long-term stability and proven track record of the company. The recent news reinforces the company's positive standing, suggesting confidence in its continued growth.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
