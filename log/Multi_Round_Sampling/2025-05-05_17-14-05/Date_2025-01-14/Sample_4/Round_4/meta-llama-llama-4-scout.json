(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, historical performance, and new opportunities in services and AI, which typically bolster investor confidence. While there are arguments for potential growth opportunities, the mention of alternative investments suggests a cautious stance for aggressive investors. Overall, the positive tone regarding Apple's advantages and growth potential indicates a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple due to the start of semiconductor supply from TSMC's Arizona fab. This diversifies Apple's supply chain, reducing reliance on Taiwan which is subject to geopolitical risks. This is a strategic move aligning with the broader trend of reshoring critical manufacturing in the US and may be viewed favorably as mitigating risk, improving supply chain security, and potentially garnering political favor or subsidies. Although there were logistical challenges mentioned and shipping to Amkor in Taiwan initially, these hurdles are framed with an acknowledgement of the overall tide of reshoring of critical manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. The news of the Arizona plant opening is a long way off (Q1 2025), thus the news may have a small immediate effect. The fact that AMD and NVDA are testing production there as well, signals the viability of the facility, not competition for Apple. Thus, the overall impression is a slight positive, though it's impact may be relatively small given the timing and some minor headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?\", is extremely vague and offers no actionable information regarding Apple's financial performance, prospects, or any specific events.  It's a generic clickbait headline that doesn't provide any basis for predicting stock price movement.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is negligible. The probabilities should reflect the inherent volatility and market factors rather than this headline's content.  We'll assume a neutral market day with slightly more probability of a minor movement upward due to the overall positive perception of Apple in the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline is generic and does not contain specific positive or negative information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Without concrete details such as earnings reports, product launches, or market trends, it is difficult to assess the direct impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the neutral nature of the headline and general market behavior.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in regaining market share in 2025 with the help of AI. It mentions that Apple's iPhone market share slipped to 18% worldwide in 2024, with a 2% sales decline, while the wider market grew 4% globally. The article also highlights the US government's new regulations on AI chip exports, which could impact Apple's AI development and market performance. However, Apple is working on partnerships to provide AI features in regions like China. Considering these factors, the news seems to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.45, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' suggests a positive outlook for luxury stocks, which includes Apple Inc. as a prominent player in the luxury technology market. This positive sentiment can lead to increased investor interest and potentially drive up the stock price. However, the news content provided is minimal and lacks specific details about Apple Inc. or its current performance. Despite this, the general positive tone towards luxury stocks can still influence investor sentiment in favor of Apple Inc. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, based on the positive sentiment towards luxury stocks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' itself does not provide concrete details about Apple Inc.'s current financial status, market performance, or future prospects. The phrase suggests potential investor interest but lacks actionable information or context which could trigger immediate price movements. Without additional specifics such as recent earnings reports, product launches, market share changes, or regulatory impacts, it is difficult to ascertain how investors might react. It seems more of an invitation for investors to consider Apple\u2019s strong market position rather than a direct catalyst for significant stock price fluctuation.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant market position and competitive advantages, including strong earnings, innovative products, and the potential for growth in services and AI. While there are mentions of a more cautious stance for aggressive investors and references to alternative investment opportunities, the overall sentiment remains positive toward Apple's long-term prospects. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising despite some caution in the market. Considering the previous predictions that align with similar positive sentiment and the inherently strong performance history of Apple, I estimate a higher probability for a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Bringing chip manufacturing to the US reduces geopolitical risk and supply chain vulnerability, a key concern for investors. Although Q1 2025 is a ways off, the announcement signals long-term strategic improvements which will likely lead to a positive investor response, even if tempered in the short term. Other major companies using the fab is also a positive indicator which reduces risk of Apple solely contributing large capital commitment. The delay in the facility and current reliance on package shipping back to Taiwan serves as a constraint on immediate impact. However, considering the opinions of other predictors and their trends, I would raise the probability of stock increase due to positive news of supply chain resilience. Given similar previous positive news, this justifies moving upwards more compared round 0.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline is vague and offers no specific information about Apple's financial health or future prospects.  Therefore, its impact on the stock price is likely minimal. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting stock movements based on such limited information.  While some models lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price increase due to Apple's generally positive market perception, others point to potential negative factors or simply the inherent volatility of the market. Considering the lack of substantial news, along with the diversity of previous predictions, a neutral stance appears most appropriate. I've weighted the prior predictions, giving slightly more weight to those models that provided more thorough justifications (while acknowledging potential biases in those models due to hidden inputs), resulting in a probability closer to neutral but slightly favoring a rise, reflecting Apple's overall strong market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is generic and lacks specific details about Apple Inc.'s financial performance or market trends. Previous predictions from other models show a wide range of probabilities, indicating mixed sentiment. The models that provided higher probabilities for a stock price rise (e.g., 0.7, 0.6) focused on Apple's strong market position and potential growth opportunities, while those with lower probabilities (e.g., 0.3, 0.45) cited the lack of concrete information or neutral/negative factors like market share decline. Given the ambiguity of the headline and the lack of specific positive or negative catalysts, the most balanced approach is to assign neutral probabilities, slightly leaning towards a rise due to Apple's general market strength and investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' suggests a positive outlook for luxury stocks, which includes Apple Inc. as a prominent player in the luxury technology market. This positive sentiment can lead to increased investor interest and potentially drive up the stock price. However, the news content provided is minimal and lacks specific details about Apple Inc. or its current performance. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a slightly positive or neutral impact on the stock price. Given the lack of concrete information and the general positive tone towards luxury stocks, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' itself does not offer concrete details about Apple Inc.'s current financial status, market performance, or future prospects beyond highlighting their dominant market position. The varied opinions from previous models indicate a mix of positive and negative sentiments due to different contextual factors mentioned by each model. Taking a balanced view, and considering the general neutral tone and lack of specificity in the headline, along with the previously diverse predictions, it is reasonable to lean towards a slightly negative outlook due to uncertainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong market position, historical performance, and potential growth opportunities in services and AI, all of which typically bolster investor confidence. While some caution is expressed for aggressive investors and alternative investment opportunities are mentioned, the overall sentiment remains positive. An important aspect is Apple's robust competitive advantage, which is less likely to be undermined by short-term market fluctuations. Given this, I estimate a probability of 0.67 for the stock price to rise, reflecting positive investor sentiment, while the probability of the stock price falling is 0.33, considering potential uncertainties and cautious sentiments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about TSMC's Arizona fab launching and supplying Apple in Q1 2025 is a moderately positive signal. It signifies a move towards supply chain diversification and resilience, reducing dependence on Taiwan, which is a geopolitical risk. Although mass production is still some time away and initial packaging will be done in Taiwan, the news demonstrates long-term strategic benefit for Apple. AMD and Nvidia also doing test productions indicates viability. Analysis of previous rounds indicates a slightly positive sentiment. Considering this, and slightly increasing positivity as most prediction models have predicted similarly, I will set probability of stock price rising to be slightly higher, while the probability of stock price falling to be slightly lower.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is vague and provides no specific information about Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the headline's impact.  While some models lean towards a rise due to Apple's generally positive market perception and potential growth areas like AI and services, other models point to potential negative factors like market share concerns or the inherent volatility of the market. The conflicting predictions across multiple rounds suggest that the headline itself has little to no direct impact on investor sentiment.  Therefore, the probabilities should primarily reflect the inherent volatility of the stock market and Apple's general market strength. Given the lack of concrete news and the divergence of expert opinions, a slightly higher probability of a rise is assigned based on the overwhelmingly positive perception of Apple as a company, but the probabilities are relatively close to neutral, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is generic and lacks specific details about Apple Inc.'s financial performance or market trends. Previous predictions from other models show a wide range of probabilities, indicating mixed sentiment. The models that provided higher probabilities for a stock price rise (e.g., 0.7, 0.6) focused on Apple's strong market position and potential growth opportunities, while those with lower probabilities (e.g., 0.3, 0.45) cited the lack of concrete information or neutral/negative factors like market share decline. Given the ambiguity of the headline and the lack of specific positive or negative catalysts, the most balanced approach is to assign neutral probabilities, slightly leaning towards a rise due to Apple's general market strength and investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in regaining market share in 2025 with the help of AI. It mentions that Apple's iPhone market share slipped to 18% worldwide in 2024, with a 2% sales decline, while the wider market grew 4% globally. However, Apple is working on partnerships to provide AI features in regions like China. The US government's new regulations on AI chip exports could impact Apple's AI development and market performance. Considering these factors, the news seems to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong market position and potential growth opportunities in AI and services suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' suggests a positive outlook for luxury stocks, which includes Apple Inc. as a prominent player in the luxury technology market. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a slightly positive or neutral impact on the stock price. Given the lack of concrete information and the general positive tone towards luxury stocks, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The news does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s current performance, but the overall sentiment remains positive toward Apple's long-term prospects. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price rising despite some caution in the market.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' itself does not offer concrete details about Apple Inc.'s current financial status, market performance, or future prospects beyond highlighting their dominant market position. The varied opinions from previous models indicate a mix of positive and negative sentiments due to different contextual factors mentioned by each model. Taking a balanced view, and considering the general neutral tone and lack of specificity in the headline, along with the previously diverse predictions, it is reasonable to lean towards a slightly negative outlook due to uncertainty.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.67, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.33, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong competitive position, historical performance, and potential for growth through services and AI, which contributes positively to investor sentiment. Despite mentioning alternative investment opportunities that may deter aggressive investors, the overall outlook remains favorable toward Apple's long-term prospects. Considering the previous predictions from multiple models, many indicate a higher probability of a price rise, reflecting the general confidence in Apple's market resilience and innovations. Thus, I estimate a probability of 0.67 for the stock price to rise and 0.33 for it to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news about TSMC starting to supply Apple with semiconductors from its Arizona fab in Q1 2025 is a positive development. It signifies a move towards greater supply chain independence and reduces reliance on Taiwan, mitigating geopolitical risks. While the mass production is still some time away and the chips will initially be sent back to Taiwan for packaging, this move strengthens the U.S. semiconductor industry and secures Apple's supply chain in the long run. Other companies like AMD and Nvidia also testing production at the facility makes it even more positive. The previous predictions also show a general trend towards a slightly positive outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to this positive news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline is vague and offers no specific information regarding Apple's financial performance or future prospects.  This lack of concrete information makes it difficult to definitively predict stock price movement solely based on this headline.  However, the analysis of previous predictions reveals a trend. While there's significant divergence in the early rounds, later rounds generally show a convergence toward a slightly higher probability of a price rise.  This reflects the underlying positive market sentiment towards Apple, its strong market position, and potential growth opportunities in areas like AI and services.  While some models highlight potential negative factors (market share decline, regulatory risks), the overall weight of opinion, especially in later rounds, suggests a more positive outlook. I'm therefore weighting the later, more consistent predictions slightly more, acknowledging the limitations of the vague headline. The inherent volatility of the market is also a significant factor.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline, 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?', is relatively neutral and lacks specific details about Apple's financial performance or market trends. Previous predictions from other models show a mix of positive, neutral, and slightly negative sentiments. Models that leaned positive (e.g., 0.6-0.7) cited Apple's strong market position and potential growth opportunities in AI and services, while neutral or negative models (e.g., 0.3-0.45) highlighted the lack of concrete information or potential headwinds like market share struggles. Given the ambiguity of the headline and Apple's overall strong market perception, I assign a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in the market. The trend from previous rounds also shows a slight upward adjustment in positive sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' suggests a positive outlook for luxury stocks, which includes Apple Inc. as a prominent player in the luxury technology market.
