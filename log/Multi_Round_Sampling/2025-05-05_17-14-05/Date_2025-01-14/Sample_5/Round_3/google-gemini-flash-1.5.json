(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates caution regarding Apple's upcoming earnings, highlighting potential challenges such as the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, regulatory issues in Indonesia, and competitive pressure in China. Although a 4% revenue growth forecast sounds positive, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and believes that guidance may not meet market expectations. This combination of mixed signals suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its market dominance, strong competitive advantages, and potential for future growth through services and AI. While acknowledging that Apple's growth might not be as explosive as younger companies, it suggests the stock is still a compelling buy for most investors due to its established moat and new growth opportunities. The mention of a Motley Fool stock advisor's negative view of AAPL and their higher recommendation for NVDA should be considered but is only a single negative data point relative to numerous arguments in favor of AAPL at the present time. Weighing the positive assessment against this negative input suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase, but the degree should not be considered particularly high, as the analysis is limited and forward-looking.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is losing market share, particularly in China due to the lack of a competitive AI suite and new US export restrictions on AI chips, the article also highlights Apple's continued strength in non-core markets.  The uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulations introduces further volatility. The fact that Apple is ranked only 2nd on the list of important AI news and ratings on investors' radar, and that the article promotes other AI stocks as potentially more promising, suggests a relatively cautious outlook for Apple's near-term AI-driven growth.  The overall tone is more negative than positive, although not overwhelmingly bearish. The hedge fund interest in Apple (158 holders) indicates some continued confidence, however, this is not a strong indicator of future performance based on this news alone. The probability estimates reflect a slight bias toward a price fall, due to the market share loss and the uncertainties surrounding AI development and regulations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 results and highlights challenges despite a 4% revenue growth forecast. The analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, citing concerns such as the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. Additionally, Nispel notes that Apple's guidance may not meet market expectations, even if it aligns with Wall Street's earnings projections. These factors suggest a cautious outlook for Apple's stock price in the near term, making a stock price rise less likely and a fall more probable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc.'s position as a safe dividend stock for 2025, with a strong history of consistent dividend payments and a low 5-year average payout ratio of 17.4%. The company's recent financial performance, including a 6% growth in revenue and a strong cash position, also supports a positive outlook. Additionally, the fact that 158 hedge funds hold stakes in Apple Inc. worth nearly $110 billion indicates a high level of investor confidence. However, the article also mentions that the company's dividend yield is relatively low at 0.42%, which might not be attractive to some investors seeking higher yields. Overall, the positive factors outweigh the negative ones, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's quarterly results and future outlook. While there is a positive indication with revenue growth expected at 4%, there are significant concerns raised by the analyst including potential underwhelming guidance, no AI-driven updates, market restrictions in Indonesia, competitive pressures in China, and weaker demand for certain products. These factors could negatively impact investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that despite a forecasted 4% revenue growth for Q1, analyst Brandon Nispel maintains an 'underweight' rating, pointing out significant challenges such as a lack of AI-driven product updates, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and increased competition, particularly in China. Although some previous predictions noted potential positives such as Apple's market dominance, the prevailing concerns suggest a cautious outlook, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling. Analysts seem to concur that the guidance might fall short of expectations, further reinforcing the likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive view of Apple, highlighting its market dominance, strong competitive advantage, and potential growth in services and AI. While it acknowledges Apple might not experience the exponential growth of younger companies, it suggests it remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its established market leadership. However, the article also mentions that the Fool analysts believe there are better choices for investors, which creates a mixed outlook. Considering the historical data over a long term suggests a higher chance of stock price incrasing. In the long perspective of multiple rounds of prediction, people began to become pessimistic from optimistic. I will take the optimistic first, but a bit pessimistic later.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the article highlights Apple's struggles with losing market share, especially in China due to the lack of a competitive AI suite and US export restrictions, it also mentions continued strength in other markets. The upcoming change in US administration and its potential impact on AI regulations adds uncertainty.  The fact that Apple is only ranked second on an AI stock list and that other AI stocks are touted as potentially better investments suggests a relatively cautious outlook. However, the high number of hedge funds holding AAPL (158) indicates some continued confidence.  Considering the previous predictions' range and the mixed signals in the news, a neutral-to-slightly bearish outlook is warranted. The previous predictions show a wide divergence of opinion, reflecting the inherent uncertainty. I'm giving slightly more weight to the negative aspects based on the market share loss and regulatory uncertainties, leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, but it also highlights challenges such as stagnating device sales, a high valuation, and competition from other tech giants like Amazon. The article suggests that while Apple's Services segment is growing, its reliance on physical device sales and its current valuation leave little room for significant upward movement. Additionally, the article implies that Nvidia and Amazon may have clearer paths to the $5 trillion mark due to their respective strengths in AI and cloud services. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Apple's stock price rising in the near term seems limited, while the potential for a decline is higher given the cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a cautious outlook for Apple's upcoming Q1 results. Despite a 4% revenue growth forecast, the analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target, citing challenges such as the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. These factors suggest that Apple's guidance may not meet market expectations, making a stock price rise less likely and a fall more probable. The presence of mixed signals, with both positive and negative factors, leads to a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its position as a safe dividend stock for 2025, with a strong history of consistent dividend payments and a low 5-year average payout ratio of 17.4%. The company's recent financial performance, including a 6% growth in revenue and a strong cash position, also supports a positive outlook. Additionally, the fact that 158 hedge funds hold stakes in Apple Inc. worth nearly $110 billion indicates a high level of investor confidence. However, the article also mentions that the company's dividend yield is relatively low at 0.42%, which might not be attractive to some investors seeking higher yields. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising and others predicting a higher probability of it falling. However, the overall tone of the article and the company's financial performance suggest a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's quarterly results and future outlook. While there is a positive indication with revenue growth expected at 4%, there are significant concerns raised by the analyst including potential underwhelming guidance, no AI-driven updates, market restrictions in Indonesia, competitive pressures in China, and weaker demand for certain products. Previous predictions from various models suggest a cautious outlook with higher probabilities of the stock price falling. Considering all these factors, the overall sentiment appears to be slightly on the negative side.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news regarding Apple's upcoming Q1 results highlights a mix of cautious sentiment and positive projections. While the forecasted 4% revenue growth is a positive indicator, the analyst Brandon Nispel maintains an 'underweight' rating, citing significant challenges including competitive pressures in China, a lack of AI-driven product updates, and regulatory issues. These factors suggest that Apple's guidance may not meet or exceed market expectations, leading to a higher likelihood of a price decline. The previous predictions reflect a trend of cautious outlooks among analysts, predominantly indicating a greater probability of stock price fall relative to rise. Balancing this outlook, I estimate a probability of 0.35 for stock price rise and 0.65 for stock price fall based on the current mixed signals and prevailing concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a balanced view of Apple, acknowledging its strong position and future potential in services and AI, but also pointing out that its growth may not be as explosive as that of younger companies. The news focuses on whether Apple is a good buy now. The key is that if you want enormous growth, you might find better opportunities elsewhere but it still makes a compelling buy as the company has a strong moat and is adding AI services. Competitively, a good moat helps Apple remain a market leader. Looking at the summary trend from the previous predictions, those who were optimistic are more pessimistic, and those who are pessimistic are mostly the same. Thus, the article has more positive aspects, thus the stock price probability should be higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company shows continued strength in some non-core markets and has a large number of hedge fund investors, significant headwinds exist.  Apple is losing market share, particularly in China due to a lack of a competitive AI suite and US export restrictions on AI chips. The article also highlights concerns about underwhelming product upgrades and potential unmet market expectations.  The incoming Trump administration's potentially shifting stance on AI regulations adds further uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a significant divergence of opinion, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 and probabilities of a price fall similarly ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. Considering the preponderance of negative factors (market share loss, regulatory uncertainty, competitive pressures) and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise. The overall uncertainty necessitates a probability closer to 0.5 for both scenarios.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, but it also highlights several challenges such as stagnating device sales, a high valuation, and competition from other tech giants like Amazon. While Apple's Services segment is growing, its reliance on physical device sales and its current valuation leave little room for significant upward movement. The article suggests that Nvidia and Amazon may have clearer paths to the $5 trillion mark due to their respective strengths in AI and cloud services. Previous predictions from models indicate mixed signals, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's market dominance and others seeing a fall due to competitive pressures and high valuations. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Apple's stock price rising in the near term seems limited, while the potential for a decline is higher given the cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a cautious outlook for Apple's upcoming Q1 results.

These factors suggest that Apple's guidance may not meet market expectations, making a stock price rise less likely and a fall more probable. The presence of mixed signals, with both positive and negative factors, leads to a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline. Considering previous predictions, there is a general trend towards a cautious outlook with higher probabilities of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's position as a safe dividend stock for 2025, highlighting its strong history of consistent dividend payments, low 5-year average payout ratio, and recent financial performance. However, it also mentions the company's relatively low dividend yield and the potential for AI-driven growth. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions from various models, which show a range of opinions, the overall tone suggests a cautious outlook. The fact that 158 hedge funds hold stakes in Apple Inc. worth nearly $110 billion indicates a high level of investor confidence, but the article also notes that some analysts believe there are better choices for investors. Taking into account the company's financial performance, investor confidence, and the potential for growth, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple's quarterly results and future outlook.
