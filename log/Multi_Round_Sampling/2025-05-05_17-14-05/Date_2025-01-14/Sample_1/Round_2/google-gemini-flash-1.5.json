(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article suggests that while Apple has achieved a significant valuation and operates in a strong segment (Services), it faces challenges with stagnant physical device sales, especially in the iPhone division. This stagnation, coupled with its high valuation relative to historical levels, implies limited upside for the stock price in the short term. Additionally, the discussion around other companies like Amazon and Nvidia indicates a preference for companies with diversified business sources that are less reliant on AI trends. Therefore, while there is potential for some stock price rise due to general market optimism around tech companies, the overall assessment indicates a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock experiencing a fall due to its valuation challenges and slowing growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive long-term development for Apple, but with some short-term uncertainties. The 'Made in America' chips from the TSMC Arizona fab signal reduced geopolitical risk and supply chain diversification, which are generally positive for Apple's stock. However, the Q1 2025 launch is still some time away. Also, there are concerns about logistics and the necessity of sending chips back to Taiwan for packaging. The initial verification process also indicates potential quality concerns that could impact performance. These supply hurdles are potential risks that may limit positive stock movement in the short term. Given the time horizon and associated risks, the positive aspects slightly outweigh the potential negatives. Other positive aspects are: US government is eager to increase domestic chip manufacturing through acts such as the CHIPS act and that these subsidies will provide a tailwind for apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is losing market share, particularly in China due to the lack of a competitive AI suite and new US export restrictions on AI chips, the article also highlights Apple's continued strength in non-core markets.  The uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulations also adds volatility.  The article's ranking of AAPL as second on a list of important AI news and ratings suggests some positive sentiment, but it also downplays Apple's AI prospects relative to other companies. The overall tone is somewhat negative, focusing on Apple's struggles and the competitive landscape. However, the fact that Apple remains a prominent tech giant with a large number of hedge fund holders suggests a degree of inherent resilience and potential for recovery.  The probability estimates reflect this balance of negative and positive factors, with a slight lean towards a fall given the current market share loss and uncertainty around AI development.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are generic and do not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. Without concrete news such as earnings reports, product launches, or macroeconomic factors, it is difficult to determine a clear direction for the stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the lack of actionable information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to AI technology and its impact on the company's market share. The US government's new regulations on AI chip exports may affect Apple's competitors more directly, but Apple's own AI initiatives and market performance are crucial factors. Apple's recent underwhelming upgrades and loss of market share, especially to Android device makers from China, are noted. However, the article also mentions Apple's efforts to partner with local players to provide AI features. The overall sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative, but the long-term potential of AI for Apple could mitigate significant declines.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The article suggests that Amazon has a clear path to becoming the first $5 trillion company on Wall Street, surpassing Nvidia and other tech giants. The reasoning behind this prediction is Amazon's diversified business segments, including its cloud infrastructure service platform AWS, advertising services, and subscription services, which are expected to drive growth and increase cash flow. Additionally, Amazon's historical valuation multiples are considered inexpensive compared to its current valuation, providing room for growth. This analysis leads to an estimated high probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong competitive advantage, robust revenue generation, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new frontiers such as AI and services. The content emphasizes the company's potential for continued growth, which may appeal to both conservative and long-term investors. Given the positive tone and the strong fundamentals presented, it is likely that this news will positively influence investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the mention of Apple as a potential contender for the first $5 trillion company suggests some level of confidence, the discussion highlights significant challenges the company faces, particularly concerning stagnant device sales and high valuations. Compared to industry peers like Nvidia and Amazon, which are positioned more favorably due to their diversified business models and growth prospects in AI and cloud services, Apple appears to have a limited growth trajectory in the short term. The overall tone leans towards caution due to Apple\u2019s challenges and competition from other tech giants, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's supply chain diversification with the TSMC Arizona fab is generally positive, mitigating geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. While mass production isn't slated until Q1 2025, the anticipation of a more secure and domestically sourced chip supply could positively affect investor sentiment. However, the initial quality verification and reliance on Taiwanese facilities for packaging (until the Peoria facility is complete) introduces short-term uncertainties and logistical challenges. Taking into account previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment although, most estimations lean towards positive direction. I slightly agree in the positive direction because of US government actions through CHIPS act. But there are still risks associated with logistic. The general belief trending upwards makes me also give a higher prediction this time. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company faces challenges like losing market share, particularly in China due to a lack of a competitive AI suite and US export restrictions on AI chips, there are also positive aspects. Apple's continued strength in non-core markets and the high number of hedge fund holders suggest resilience. The incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulations adds uncertainty.  The previous predictions are varied, with some leaning towards a price fall due to the market share loss and AI challenges, and others showing a more positive outlook based on Apple's overall strength and potential AI growth in the long term. Considering the overall uncertainty and the mixed nature of the news, I am assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, with a slight edge towards a price fall given the immediate market share concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is quite generic and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. However, previous predictions from other models show a mix of sentiments, ranging from positive to negative. Some models highlight Apple's challenges with stagnant device sales and high valuation, while others emphasize its strong fundamentals and growth potential in services and AI. The lack of concrete news makes it difficult to predict a clear direction, but the overall sentiment seems balanced with a slight lean towards positive given Apple's robust financial health and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is not expected to be the first $5 trillion company due to its reliance on physical device sales, which have stagnated. The article suggests Amazon has a clearer path to reaching this valuation due to its diversified business segments, including AWS, advertising, and subscription services. However, Apple's involvement in AI and its strong brand presence are positives. Considering the news content and the fact that Apple is already trading at a high valuation, the probability of its stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong competitive advantage, robust revenue generation, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new frontiers such as AI and services. The content emphasizes the company's potential for continued growth, which may appeal to both conservative and long-term investors. Given the positive tone and the strong fundamentals presented, it is likely that this news will positively influence investor sentiment. Additionally, previous predictions from models like qwen/qwen-turbo and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct suggest high probabilities of stock price rise, which aligns with the optimistic outlook of the news article.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
