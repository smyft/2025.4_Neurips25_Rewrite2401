(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Company -- and It's Not Nvidia\nNews Content: Change is perhaps the only certainty on Wall Street. Due to factors such as innovation, competition, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and legal judgments, the puzzle pieces that make up the largest publicly traded companies are constantly in flux.\n\nWhen 2004 came to a close, ExxonMobil was the largest publicly traded company in the S&P 500, with Citigroup and General Electric also in the top 10. Today, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the only member of the end-of-2004 top 10 that's still among America's largest publicly traded companies.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2023, we've witnessed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all surpass the $3 trillion valuation plateau. Although Nvidia would seem like the surest bet to reach the psychologically important $5 trillion level given the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a dark-horse candidate may have the clearest path to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nNvidia is battling against history, which has a flawless track record\n\nOn one hand, there's no denying that Nvidia has enjoyed a textbook operating expansion. The company's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their high-compute data centers.\n\nWith demand for GPUs overwhelming supply, Nvidia has been able to command $30,000 to $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU. Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidia's gross margin to as high as 78.4% last year.\n\nWhile the long-term outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has real-world applications in most industries around the globe, Nvidia's chances of becoming Wall Street's first $5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers. Though the internet did, eventually, alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way, it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels.\n\nIncluding the internet, every game-changing technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology/innovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility. With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how they'll maximize the return on their AI investments, it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia, the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest. Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a $5 trillion valuation first.Image source: Amazon.\n\nThis dark-horse candidate has a clear path to become America's largest public company\n\nIf history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts, it would also be bad news for Microsoft, which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligence-driven future. Although Microsoft's operating cash flow isn't as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia, being the first to reach a $5 trillion valuation would be a stretch.\n\nThe same can be said for Wall Street's other $3 trillion public company, Apple. Though Apple's Services segment continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, its physical device sales, including iPhone, have stagnated for two years. Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade, which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another $1.4 trillion.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" component that appears to have the clearest path to a $5 trillion market cap is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhen most consumers and investors hear the Amazon name, they think of its dominant online marketplace. Last February, eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2024. While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades, e-commerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income.\n\nThe lion's share of Amazon's growth potential (specifically growth in cash flow) originates from its ancillary operating segments, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) at the front of the pack.\n\nBased on data from tech-analysis firm Canalys, AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 33% share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024. For context, Amazon's share of spending among cloud-service providers is more than Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, combined \u2014 and these are the No's 2 and 3 in global cloud-service spending.\n\nEven though AI has played a role in AWS's growth, enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady double-digit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. With enterprise cloud-service spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion, Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon's advertising services and subscription services (e.g., Prime) segments are also respectively growing by double digits. Amazon's push into exclusive sporting events (Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages) should improve demand for advertising, as well as support its subscription pricing power.\n\nThe key point is that, unlike Microsoft and Nvidia, Amazon wouldn't be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts.\n\nLastly, Amazon remains historically inexpensive. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of the company. But as of the closing bell on Jan. 10, Amazon's shares are valued at just 13.5 times consensus cash flow for 2026. If Amazon were to reach the median year-end multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019, it would become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article suggests that while Apple has achieved a significant valuation and operates in a strong segment (Services), it faces challenges with stagnant physical device sales, especially in the iPhone division. This stagnation, coupled with its high valuation relative to historical levels, implies limited upside for the stock price in the short term. Additionally, the discussion around other companies like Amazon and Nvidia indicates a preference for companies with diversified business sources that are less reliant on AI trends. Therefore, while there is potential for some stock price rise due to general market optimism around tech companies, the overall assessment indicates a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock experiencing a fall due to its valuation challenges and slowing growth.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive long-term development for Apple, but with some short-term uncertainties. The 'Made in America' chips from the TSMC Arizona fab signal reduced geopolitical risk and supply chain diversification, which are generally positive for Apple's stock. However, the Q1 2025 launch is still some time away. Also, there are concerns about logistics and the necessity of sending chips back to Taiwan for packaging. The initial verification process also indicates potential quality concerns that could impact performance. These supply hurdles are potential risks that may limit positive stock movement in the short term. Given the time horizon and associated risks, the positive aspects slightly outweigh the potential negatives. Other positive aspects are: US government is eager to increase domestic chip manufacturing through acts such as the CHIPS act and that these subsidies will provide a tailwind for apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is losing market share, particularly in China due to the lack of a competitive AI suite and new US export restrictions on AI chips, the article also highlights Apple's continued strength in non-core markets.  The uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulations also adds volatility.  The article's ranking of AAPL as second on a list of important AI news and ratings suggests some positive sentiment, but it also downplays Apple's AI prospects relative to other companies. The overall tone is somewhat negative, focusing on Apple's struggles and the competitive landscape. However, the fact that Apple remains a prominent tech giant with a large number of hedge fund holders suggests a degree of inherent resilience and potential for recovery.  The probability estimates reflect this balance of negative and positive factors, with a slight lean towards a fall given the current market share loss and uncertainty around AI development.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are generic and do not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. Without concrete news such as earnings reports, product launches, or macroeconomic factors, it is difficult to determine a clear direction for the stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the lack of actionable information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to AI technology and its impact on the company's market share. The US government's new regulations on AI chip exports may affect Apple's competitors more directly, but Apple's own AI initiatives and market performance are crucial factors. Apple's recent underwhelming upgrades and loss of market share, especially to Android device makers from China, are noted. However, the article also mentions Apple's efforts to partner with local players to provide AI features. The overall sentiment seems neutral to slightly negative, but the long-term potential of AI for Apple could mitigate significant declines.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The article suggests that Amazon has a clear path to becoming the first $5 trillion company on Wall Street, surpassing Nvidia and other tech giants. The reasoning behind this prediction is Amazon's diversified business segments, including its cloud infrastructure service platform AWS, advertising services, and subscription services, which are expected to drive growth and increase cash flow. Additionally, Amazon's historical valuation multiples are considered inexpensive compared to its current valuation, providing room for growth. This analysis leads to an estimated high probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong competitive advantage, robust revenue generation, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new frontiers such as AI and services. The content emphasizes the company's potential for continued growth, which may appeal to both conservative and long-term investors. Given the positive tone and the strong fundamentals presented, it is likely that this news will positively influence investor sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the mention of Apple as a potential contender for the first $5 trillion company suggests some level of confidence, the discussion highlights significant challenges the company faces, particularly concerning stagnant device sales and high valuations. Compared to industry peers like Nvidia and Amazon, which are positioned more favorably due to their diversified business models and growth prospects in AI and cloud services, Apple appears to have a limited growth trajectory in the short term. The overall tone leans towards caution due to Apple\u2019s challenges and competition from other tech giants, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple's supply chain diversification with the TSMC Arizona fab is generally positive, mitigating geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. While mass production isn't slated until Q1 2025, the anticipation of a more secure and domestically sourced chip supply could positively affect investor sentiment. However, the initial quality verification and reliance on Taiwanese facilities for packaging (until the Peoria facility is complete) introduces short-term uncertainties and logistical challenges. Taking into account previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment although, most estimations lean towards positive direction. I slightly agree in the positive direction because of US government actions through CHIPS act. But there are still risks associated with logistic. The general belief trending upwards makes me also give a higher prediction this time. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company faces challenges like losing market share, particularly in China due to a lack of a competitive AI suite and US export restrictions on AI chips, there are also positive aspects. Apple's continued strength in non-core markets and the high number of hedge fund holders suggest resilience. The incoming Trump administration's stance on AI regulations adds uncertainty.  The previous predictions are varied, with some leaning towards a price fall due to the market share loss and AI challenges, and others showing a more positive outlook based on Apple's overall strength and potential AI growth in the long term. Considering the overall uncertainty and the mixed nature of the news, I am assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, with a slight edge towards a price fall given the immediate market share concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is quite generic and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. However, previous predictions from other models show a mix of sentiments, ranging from positive to negative. Some models highlight Apple's challenges with stagnant device sales and high valuation, while others emphasize its strong fundamentals and growth potential in services and AI. The lack of concrete news makes it difficult to predict a clear direction, but the overall sentiment seems balanced with a slight lean towards positive given Apple's robust financial health and market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is not expected to be the first $5 trillion company due to its reliance on physical device sales, which have stagnated. The article suggests Amazon has a clearer path to reaching this valuation due to its diversified business segments, including AWS, advertising, and subscription services. However, Apple's involvement in AI and its strong brand presence are positives. Considering the news content and the fact that Apple is already trading at a high valuation, the probability of its stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong competitive advantage, robust revenue generation, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new frontiers such as AI and services. The content emphasizes the company's potential for continued growth, which may appeal to both conservative and long-term investors. Given the positive tone and the strong fundamentals presented, it is likely that this news will positively influence investor sentiment. Additionally, previous predictions from models like qwen/qwen-turbo and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct suggest high probabilities of stock price rise, which aligns with the optimistic outlook of the news article.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
