(AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty for investors. This uncertainty could lead to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline, although Apple's established market position could provide some stability. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the uncertain economic climate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's strong financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, Neural Engine), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are all positive factors that could attract investors. Navellier's reputation as a successful growth investor adds further weight to the positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that some other stocks hold \"greater promise for delivering higher returns ... within a shorter time frame.\" This suggests that while Apple is a solid long-term pick, it may not be the most explosive growth stock in Navellier's portfolio. Plus the article is from an aggregator website and not new primary research from a investment bank. Overall this is slightly positive news, but only provides a marginal boost.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple is not directly involved in this situation.  While a prolonged TikTok ban *could* have had indirect effects on Apple (e.g., reduced app downloads, reduced advertising revenue for Apple's services if creators shifted to other platforms), the temporary shutdown and subsequent reinstatement have a minimal impact. The overall effect on Apple's stock price is likely negligible.  Therefore, the probabilities of a price increase or decrease due to this news are approximately equal to the normal market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, with expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is expected to benefit from these policies. Analysts predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with tech stocks potentially rising by 25% in 2025. The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts, along with the anticipation of reduced regulatory hurdles, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The content appears to be a general description of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a stock market index that includes AAPL. Since there is no company-specific news, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of AAPL. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to reassurances from President Trump and TikTok's service providers. However, skepticism is expressed by key figures within Congress regarding the legal foundation of this decision. If TikTok is ultimately allowed to continue operating in the US, it might indirectly impact companies like Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest, but it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Thus, the immediate impact on AAPL stock is neutral, and more context-specific factors related to Apple's own business performance and product cycles will likely hold greater sway.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
