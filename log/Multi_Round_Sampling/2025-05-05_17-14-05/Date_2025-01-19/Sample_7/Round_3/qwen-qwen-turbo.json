(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty for investors. This uncertainty could lead to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline, although Apple's established market position could provide some stability. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the uncertain economic climate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's strong financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, Neural Engine), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are all positive factors that could attract investors. Navellier's reputation as a successful growth investor adds further weight to the positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that some other stocks hold \"greater promise for delivering higher returns ... within a shorter time frame.\" This suggests that while Apple is a solid long-term pick, it may not be the most explosive growth stock in Navellier's portfolio. Plus the article is from an aggregator website and not new primary research from a investment bank. Overall this is slightly positive news, but only provides a marginal boost.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple is not directly involved in this situation.  While a prolonged TikTok ban *could* have had indirect effects on Apple (e.g., reduced app downloads, reduced advertising revenue for Apple's services if creators shifted to other platforms), the temporary shutdown and subsequent reinstatement have a minimal impact. The overall effect on Apple's stock price is likely negligible.  Therefore, the probabilities of a price increase or decrease due to this news are approximately equal to the normal market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, with expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is expected to benefit from these policies. Analysts predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with tech stocks potentially rising by 25% in 2025. The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts, along with the anticipation of reduced regulatory hurdles, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The content appears to be a general description of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a stock market index that includes AAPL. Since there is no company-specific news, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of AAPL. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to reassurances from President Trump and TikTok's service providers. However, skepticism is expressed by key figures within Congress regarding the legal foundation of this decision. If TikTok is ultimately allowed to continue operating in the US, it might indirectly impact companies like Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest, but it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Thus, the immediate impact on AAPL stock is neutral, and more context-specific factors related to Apple's own business performance and product cycles will likely hold greater sway.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum and highlights themes that could impact the global economy, including discussions on tariffs, Trump policies, and the technology sector's outlook. Given Apple's significant role in technology, uncertainty surrounding tariffs and economic policies may introduce volatility, leading to a higher risk of stock price decline. However, positive sentiments related to AI integration and Apple's established market presence provide some stability. Overall, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious outlook amidst widespread uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its robust financial performance, AI integration, and commitment to sustainability. These are generally positive signals for investors. However, the article also mentions that other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting a more moderate growth outlook for Apple compared to other options. Given Navellier's focus on growth investing and the article referencing AI advancements, there's a positive sentiment overall. Considering previous rounds, first round was mixed, indicating that Navellier's recognition and the positive factors mentioned in the article make it more likely for the stock to rise. However, compared to other predictions with predictions around 0.7, this article feels very moderate, and my prediction should be close to 0.6.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news focuses on the resolution of the TikTok ban in the US.  This event has virtually no direct impact on Apple's business. While some indirect, minor effects are possible (e.g., changes in app store revenue if user behavior shifts slightly), these are likely to be insignificant compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly centered around uncertainty regarding broader economic factors and not directly related to this specific TikTok news. Therefore, the probability of a price change due solely to this news is considered negligible.  The probabilities below reflect a near equal chance of rise or fall, reflecting the baseline market volatility and not any specific influence of the TikTok situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, with a focus on lighter regulation and tax cuts. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is expected to benefit from these policies, particularly due to reduced regulatory hurdles and increased investment in AI. Analysts predict a favorable environment for tech stocks, with potential gains of up to 25% in 2025. The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL. However, the overall market volatility and unpredictable nature of Trump's policies introduce some uncertainty, which could temper the positive outlook slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty for investors. However, there is no direct mention of Apple, suggesting that the impact on Apple's stock price may be indirect and less significant compared to companies directly involved in the discussions. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall due to the uncertain economic climate, but with a significant degree of neutrality due to the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news content provided does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. It is a general description of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which includes AAPL among many other stocks. Since there is no company-specific news, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of AAPL. Considering the diverse predictions from other models, which may be based on different analyses or information not provided in the current news, we must take into account the trend and uncertainty in the market. However, given the lack of direct relevance of the news to AAPL, the most reasonable estimate is that the news will not significantly influence the stock price, suggesting probabilities should be closer to equal, but given the nature of market volatility and considering others' more pessimistic views, a slight inclination towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook could be considered.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to reassurances from President Trump and TikTok's service providers. However, skepticism is expressed by key figures within Congress regarding the legal foundation of this decision. If TikTok is ultimately allowed to continue operating in the US, it might indirectly impact companies like Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest, but it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Thus, the immediate impact on AAPL stock is neutral, and more context-specific factors related to Apple's own business performance and product cycles will likely hold greater sway. Additionally, given the previous round predictions and trends, the consensus suggests a slightly higher skepticism about the stock price rise, but no significant impact overall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights an upcoming World Economic Forum with discussions on key topics such as tariffs, economic policies, and the tech sector's outlook, which may introduce uncertainty and volatility in the market. Although Apple is a strong player in the tech industry, its stock may be impacted more by broader economic factors discussed at the forum than by company-specific news. This uncertainty leads to a slight increase in chances of a stock price fall compared to the likelihood of a rise. Overall, while there are some positive sentiments around AI and Apple's position, the prevailing uncertainties lead to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing strong financials, AI integration, and sustainability efforts. Navellier's endorsement adds credibility. However, the article also suggests other stocks may offer faster returns. Considering previous rounds, initial sentiment was mixed, then slightly positive. The consistent endorsement from a respected investor and the positive factors mentioned lean towards a rise. I'm slightly more conservative than some earlier predictions given the 'greater promise' comment, and the understanding that aggregator articles typically don't carry as much weight than that of a investment bank. Overall, a positive signal, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the resolution of the TikTok ban, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  While there could be extremely minor indirect effects (e.g., slight changes in app store revenue), these are negligible compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting uncertainty about broader economic factors unrelated to the TikTok situation.  The consensus leans slightly towards a belief that the stock is more likely to fall than rise, but the reasons given are primarily related to general market uncertainty and political/economic factors not specifically tied to this news. Given the lack of direct relevance and the wide range of previous predictions, I am assigning near-equal probabilities, reflecting baseline market volatility and not any specific influence from the TikTok news.  Slight weighting toward a fall is included to reflect the overall cautious sentiment in the prior models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, with a focus on lighter regulation and tax cuts.

The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL. However, the overall market volatility and unpredictable nature of Trump's policies introduce some uncertainty, which could temper the positive outlook slightly. Considering the previous predictions, which range from neutral to slightly positive, the consensus leans towards a modest positive impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and highlights various themes that could impact the global economy, including discussions on tariffs, Trump policies, and the technology sector's outlook. Apple's stock price may be influenced by these discussions due to its significant role in technology and supply chain. However, there is no direct mention of Apple in the news. Given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and economic policies, there is a potential for volatility in the stock market, which might lead to a higher risk of stock price decline. Yet, Apple's established market presence and positive sentiments related to AI integration provide some stability. Considering the diverse predictions from other models and the lack of direct relevance of the news to Apple, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious outlook amidst widespread uncertainties.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain specific information about Apple Inc.
