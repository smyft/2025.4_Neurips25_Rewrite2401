(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty for investors. This uncertainty could lead to a higher likelihood of a stock price decline, although Apple's established market position could provide some stability. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the uncertain economic climate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's strong financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, Neural Engine), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are all positive factors that could attract investors. Navellier's reputation as a successful growth investor adds further weight to the positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that some other stocks hold \"greater promise for delivering higher returns ... within a shorter time frame.\" This suggests that while Apple is a solid long-term pick, it may not be the most explosive growth stock in Navellier's portfolio. Plus the article is from an aggregator website and not new primary research from a investment bank. Overall this is slightly positive news, but only provides a marginal boost.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US.  Apple is not directly involved in this situation.  While a prolonged TikTok ban *could* have had indirect effects on Apple (e.g., reduced app downloads, reduced advertising revenue for Apple's services if creators shifted to other platforms), the temporary shutdown and subsequent reinstatement have a minimal impact. The overall effect on Apple's stock price is likely negligible.  Therefore, the probabilities of a price increase or decrease due to this news are approximately equal to the normal market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector under President-elect Donald Trump's second term, with expectations of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is expected to benefit from these policies. Analysts predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with tech stocks potentially rising by 25% in 2025. The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts, along with the anticipation of reduced regulatory hurdles, suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The content appears to be a general description of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a stock market index that includes AAPL. Since there is no company-specific news, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of AAPL. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to reassurances from President Trump and TikTok's service providers. However, skepticism is expressed by key figures within Congress regarding the legal foundation of this decision. If TikTok is ultimately allowed to continue operating in the US, it might indirectly impact companies like Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest, but it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Thus, the immediate impact on AAPL stock is neutral, and more context-specific factors related to Apple's own business performance and product cycles will likely hold greater sway.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum and highlights themes that could impact the global economy, including discussions on tariffs, Trump policies, and the technology sector's outlook. Given Apple's significant role in technology, uncertainty surrounding tariffs and economic policies may introduce volatility, leading to a higher risk of stock price decline. However, positive sentiments related to AI integration and Apple's established market presence provide some stability. Overall, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautious outlook amidst widespread uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its robust financial performance, AI integration, and commitment to sustainability. These are generally positive signals for investors. However, the article also mentions that other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter time frame, suggesting a more moderate growth outlook for Apple compared to other options. Given Navellier's focus on growth investing and the article referencing AI advancements, there's a positive sentiment overall. Considering previous rounds, first round was mixed, indicating that Navellier's recognition and the positive factors mentioned in the article make it more likely for the stock to rise. However, compared to other predictions with predictions around 0.7, this article feels very moderate, and my prediction should be close to 0.6.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The news focuses on the resolution of the TikTok ban in the US.  This event has virtually no direct impact on Apple's business. While some indirect, minor effects are possible (e.g., changes in app store revenue if user behavior shifts slightly), these are likely to be insignificant compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, mostly centered around uncertainty regarding broader economic factors and not directly related to this specific TikTok news. Therefore, the probability of a price change due solely to this news is considered negligible.  The probabilities below reflect a near equal chance of rise or fall, reflecting the baseline market volatility and not any specific influence of the TikTok situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, with a focus on lighter regulation and tax cuts. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of Big Tech, which is expected to benefit from these policies, particularly due to reduced regulatory hurdles and increased investment in AI. Analysts predict a favorable environment for tech stocks, with potential gains of up to 25% in 2025. The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL. However, the overall market volatility and unpredictable nature of Trump's policies introduce some uncertainty, which could temper the positive outlook slightly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. The article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty for investors. However, there is no direct mention of Apple, suggesting that the impact on Apple's stock price may be indirect and less significant compared to companies directly involved in the discussions. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall due to the uncertain economic climate, but with a significant degree of neutrality due to the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news content provided does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. It is a general description of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which includes AAPL among many other stocks. Since there is no company-specific news, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the stock price of AAPL. Considering the diverse predictions from other models, which may be based on different analyses or information not provided in the current news, we must take into account the trend and uncertainty in the market. However, given the lack of direct relevance of the news to AAPL, the most reasonable estimate is that the news will not significantly influence the stock price, suggesting probabilities should be closer to equal, but given the nature of market volatility and considering others' more pessimistic views, a slight inclination towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook could be considered.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to reassurances from President Trump and TikTok's service providers. However, skepticism is expressed by key figures within Congress regarding the legal foundation of this decision. If TikTok is ultimately allowed to continue operating in the US, it might indirectly impact companies like Meta, Snapchat, and Pinterest, but it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Thus, the immediate impact on AAPL stock is neutral, and more context-specific factors related to Apple's own business performance and product cycles will likely hold greater sway. Additionally, given the previous round predictions and trends, the consensus suggests a slightly higher skepticism about the stock price rise, but no significant impact overall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights an upcoming World Economic Forum with discussions on key topics such as tariffs, economic policies, and the tech sector's outlook, which may introduce uncertainty and volatility in the market. Although Apple is a strong player in the tech industry, its stock may be impacted more by broader economic factors discussed at the forum than by company-specific news. This uncertainty leads to a slight increase in chances of a stock price fall compared to the likelihood of a rise. Overall, while there are some positive sentiments around AI and Apple's position, the prevailing uncertainties lead to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing strong financials, AI integration, and sustainability efforts. Navellier's endorsement adds credibility. However, the article also suggests other stocks may offer faster returns. Considering previous rounds, initial sentiment was mixed, then slightly positive. The consistent endorsement from a respected investor and the positive factors mentioned lean towards a rise. I'm slightly more conservative than some earlier predictions given the 'greater promise' comment, and the understanding that aggregator articles typically don't carry as much weight than that of a investment bank. Overall, a positive signal, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the resolution of the TikTok ban, which has minimal direct impact on Apple.  While there could be extremely minor indirect effects (e.g., slight changes in app store revenue), these are negligible compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting uncertainty about broader economic factors unrelated to the TikTok situation.  The consensus leans slightly towards a belief that the stock is more likely to fall than rise, but the reasons given are primarily related to general market uncertainty and political/economic factors not specifically tied to this news. Given the lack of direct relevance and the wide range of previous predictions, I am assigning near-equal probabilities, reflecting baseline market volatility and not any specific influence from the TikTok news.  Slight weighting toward a fall is included to reflect the overall cautious sentiment in the prior models.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, with a focus on lighter regulation and tax cuts.

The positive sentiment from industry leaders and analysts suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise for AAPL. However, the overall market volatility and unpredictable nature of Trump's policies introduce some uncertainty, which could temper the positive outlook slightly. Considering the previous predictions, which range from neutral to slightly positive, the consensus leans towards a modest positive impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and highlights various themes that could impact the global economy, including discussions on tariffs, Trump policies, and the technology sector's outlook. Apple's stock price may be influenced by these discussions due to its significant role in technology and supply chain. However, there is no direct mention of Apple in the news. Given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and economic policies, there is a potential for volatility in the stock market, which might lead to a higher risk of stock price decline. Yet, Apple's established market presence and positive sentiments related to AI integration provide some stability.
