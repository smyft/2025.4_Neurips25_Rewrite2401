(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The comments by Jim Cramer reflect a mix of skepticism regarding Apple's current innovation trajectory, highlighted by Zuckerberg's criticism that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs. However, Cramer does not outright dismiss Apple's value; rather, he contrasts it with broader issues, including interest rates and market conditions affected by external factors like the California wildfires. Overall, the negative commentary regarding innovation could sway investor sentiment, but Cramer's broader economic discussion and Apple's strong brand and revenue potential might temper the stock's decline. Given this context, there is a moderate probability of the stock price falling due to negative sentiment but also a fair chance of it rising given the company's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is about upcoming IPOs in 2025 and does not directly mention or relate to Apple Inc. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price should be negligible. While IPOs can sometimes be indicative of overall market sentiment, this single headline provides insufficient direct information to significantly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including banking, retail, AI, and crypto.  While it mentions several companies including Apple competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia, there's no direct mention of Apple or any specific news that would significantly affect its stock price. The article highlights potential market volatility due to Trump's policies and the \"Magnificent 7\" (which Apple is a part of) appearing top-heavy.  This general market uncertainty makes it difficult to definitively predict Apple's stock movement based solely on this article. The lack of specific Apple-related news suggests the probability of a significant price change, either up or down, is relatively low.  The overall market sentiment may influence the stock, but this news piece alone does not provide a strong indicator for Apple specifically.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not inherently impact Apple's stock performance. Therefore, there is no clear basis to predict a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Apple is mentioned as a stock that Buffett thinks is 'an even better business' than Coca-Cola and American Express, and it is Berkshire's largest holding. However, the article concludes that Chevron is the best pick for income investors due to its higher dividend yield. The fact that Apple is Berkshire's largest holding and Buffett's positive comments about the company suggest a positive outlook, but the article does not provide any new or surprising information that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Jim Cramer dismisses the notion that nothing has been done since Steve Jobs' death as 'ill-advised,' which could positively influence investor sentiment. On the other hand, he criticizes the company's closed ecosystem and compares Apple to the 'axis of evil.' Additionally, broader economic concerns like wildfire impacts and governmental policy changes might create uncertainty. Thus, the overall message is mixed, with both positive and negative angles.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The comments made by Jim Cramer about Apple suggest a mixed sentiment. While he acknowledges that dismissing Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs is 'ill-advised,' he doesn't explicitly dismiss the company's value. However, Cramer's critique of Apple's lack of recent innovation and comparison to negative sentiments raises concerns that could lead to a decrease in investor confidence. Furthermore, broader economic issues such as the impact of the California wildfires and governmental policy concerns contribute to uncertainty. Thus, while there is some potential for the stock to rise given strong fundamentals and brand loyalty, the current sentiment might lean towards a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline about upcoming IPOs in 2025 is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is an established company, and the anticipation of new IPOs, while potentially indicative of overall market sentiment, isn't directly related to Apple's current performance or future prospects. The previous model predictions also largely reflected this sentiment, with most assigning around a 0.4-0.5 probability to both rising and falling, indicating no strong signal. Therefore, I'll maintain a neutral stance.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors. While it mentions several companies, including Apple competitors (Microsoft and Nvidia), there's no direct mention of Apple or any specific news that would significantly affect its stock price. The article highlights potential market volatility due to Trump's policies and the general market sentiment concerning the \"Magnificent 7\", of which Apple is a part.  This creates uncertainty. The lack of specific Apple-related news suggests the probability of a significant price change (up or down) is relatively low. The overall market sentiment and the general uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies will likely be the primary drivers of Apple's short-term price movements, rather than the Davos conference itself. Considering that previous models' predictions ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 probability of a rise and 0.4 to 0.5 probability of a fall, reflecting a general uncertainty,  I will lean slightly towards a higher probability of a fall due to the overall market uncertainty highlighted in the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not inherently impact Apple's stock performance. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal. Previous predictions also indicate that the news has negligible impact, with most models assigning nearly equal probabilities to rise and fall or failing to predict due to lack of relevant information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses the potential impact of Trump's second term on various sectors, including financials, industrials, airlines, and tech. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the article mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. This could create a positive environment for Apple. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. However, the article does not provide specific negative information about Apple. Therefore, based on the positive outlook for the tech sector and the potential benefits of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Apple is mentioned as a stock that Buffett thinks is 'an even better business' than Coca-Cola and American Express, and it is Berkshire's largest holding. However, the article concludes that Chevron is the best pick for income investors due to its higher dividend yield. Considering the positive comments about Apple from Warren Buffett and its position as Berkshire's largest holding, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. Additionally, the lack of any new or surprising negative information about Apple in the article suggests that the probability of the stock price falling is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Jim Cramer's critique of Apple Inc., particularly focusing on statements made by Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that Apple hasn't innovated since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer seems skeptical of such claims but highlights broader issues impacting the market like wildfires, governmental policies, and economic uncertainties. While Cramer acknowledges Apple's strong brand and revenue potential, the negative sentiment around innovation and broader economic challenges might negatively influence investor confidence. The overall tone is mixed, creating a balanced probability for both upward and downward movements in the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The comments made by Jim Cramer about Apple express a mixed sentiment, emphasizing concerns over innovation and broader economic issues driven by external factors like California wildfires and government policies. While Cramer critiques Apple's innovation trajectory, he does not outright dismiss the company's value or potential, suggesting that investor sentiment might be cautious but not overwhelmingly negative. The potential for stock price decline exists due to the specific criticisms of innovation, but the brand's strength and market presence also provide a basis for stability. Overall, given the mixed signals, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the negative sentiment surrounding innovation concerns and broader economic uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.46, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.54, Reasoning: The news headline about upcoming IPOs in 2025 is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Apple is an established company, and IPO speculation doesn't usually affect mature stocks significantly. The previous rounds of predictions consistently reflected this, with probabilities hovering around 0.4-0.5 for both rise and fall. I will maintain a neutral stance, but given no significant signal and following the general trend from previous predictions, I'll slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a persistent minor negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors.  While it mentions several companies, including Apple competitors (Microsoft and Nvidia), there is no direct mention of Apple or any specific news that would significantly affect its stock price. The article highlights several potential factors that could influence the broader market, and consequently, Apple:  Trump's policies, interest rate changes (due to commentary from banking CEOs), tariff impacts on retail, the AI race and its impact on Nvidia (and implicitly Apple), and general market sentiment toward the 'Magnificent 7' which includes Apple.  The overall tone suggests market uncertainty rather than specific positive or negative news related directly to Apple. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, some favoring a rise and others favoring a fall, reflecting this uncertainty.  Given the lack of specific Apple-related news and the general market volatility described, I predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, as negative market sentiment is more likely to drag a large-cap stock like Apple than specific positive developments in the absence of any concrete news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content about the Nasdaq Composite Index do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price.

Previous predictions from other models also indicate that the news has negligible impact, with most assigning nearly equal probabilities to rise and fall or failing to predict due to lack of relevant information. Therefore, there is no clear basis to predict a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Trump's second term on various sectors, including tech.

This could create a positive environment for Apple. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. However, the article also mentions potential risks for certain sectors, but does not provide specific negative information about Apple. Therefore, based on the positive outlook for the tech sector and the potential benefits of lighter regulation and increased investment in AI, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, focusing on the best pick for income investors.
