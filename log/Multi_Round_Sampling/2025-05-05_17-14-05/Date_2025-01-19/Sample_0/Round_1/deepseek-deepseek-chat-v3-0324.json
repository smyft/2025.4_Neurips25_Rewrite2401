      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7, crypto, Trump coin, AI, Trump, tariffs, Fed, and everything else that will dominate Davos\nNews Content: This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nCoverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport.\n\nI actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this).\n\nMy one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen.\n\nTo me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs \u2014 and I am very lucky to be in attendance.\n\nAnd this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty.\n\nRead more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025\n\nThe conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets.\n\nThis is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late.\n\nHere's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the \"streaming now\" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app.\n\nUnlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised!\n\nStory Continues\n\nNow, on to that guide...\n\nBig bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting.\n\nThe tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs \u2014 it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy.\n\nThe race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well.\n\nCrypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman.\n\nAnd of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday.\n\nStocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty.\n\nThe political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit \u2014 and what they say once touching down \u2014 could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary service disruption due to a new law could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, if TikTok remains banned, Apple could benefit from a shift in advertising revenue towards its App Store from other platforms like Meta and Snap. However, the uncertainty surrounding potential government actions and legal challenges creates risk that could weigh on investor confidence. Additionally, strong political statements from congressional leaders against TikTok may indicate a tough stance that could impact usership of apps available in the App Store, either positively or negatively depending on future developments. Overall, the balance of risks and opportunities suggests a moderate probability of price movement in both directions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and potential market impacts from discussions and policies emerging from it, particularly concerning potential Trump policies (tariffs) and interest rates. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned indirectly as part of the \"Magnificent 7,\" which are described as potentially 'top-heavy,' suggesting a possible correction. While AI and Crypto are also mentioned, those don't have as clear and direct of an effect on Apple's stock price. The overall tone is cautious due to uncertainties surrounding economic outlook, potential Trump tariffs, and the Fed's decisions. The article suggests potential volatility and mixed signals, making it slightly more probable that Apple's stock may experience a short-term pullback or stagnation given possible shifts in macroeconomic policy. The 'top-heavy' comment and macroeconomic uncertainty weigh negatively, while AI growth is already largely priced into the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article, \"What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.  The article provides a definition of a market index, not any news that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause any significant movement in the Apple stock price. Any price change would be attributable to other market forces and not this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the article does not provide direct information or specific catalysts that would immediately affect its stock price. However, the broader themes discussed\u2014such as AI advancements, potential tariffs, and market sentiment\u2014could indirectly influence AAPL. Given Apple's position as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and its exposure to global markets, any negative sentiment around tariffs or market volatility could pose risks. Conversely, positive developments in AI or strong earnings season performance could benefit AAPL. The lack of direct AAPL-specific news suggests a neutral to slightly positive bias, but with significant uncertainty due to macroeconomic and political factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). TikTok's situation and Apple's stock price are not closely related in this context. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. The news is more relevant to TikTok and social media sectors rather than Apple directly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any information specific to Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could be used to estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling. The news appears to be about upcoming IPOs in 2025, which is unrelated to Apple's current stock performance. Therefore, it is unlikely that this news would have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US, as a result of President Trump's directive to allow service providers to avoid penalties if they continue supporting TikTok. This could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple Inc., as they are one of the key platform providers for TikTok. However, there is uncertainty because several high-ranking officials have stated their opposition, suggesting future challenges might arise. On the other hand, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta may benefit, which could indirectly impact Apple's positioning in the market.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
