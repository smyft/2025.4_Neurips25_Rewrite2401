(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's temporary service disruption due to a new law could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, if TikTok remains banned, Apple could benefit from a shift in advertising revenue towards its App Store from other platforms like Meta and Snap. However, the uncertainty surrounding potential government actions and legal challenges creates risk that could weigh on investor confidence. Additionally, strong political statements from congressional leaders against TikTok may indicate a tough stance that could impact usership of apps available in the App Store, either positively or negatively depending on future developments. Overall, the balance of risks and opportunities suggests a moderate probability of price movement in both directions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and potential market impacts from discussions and policies emerging from it, particularly concerning potential Trump policies (tariffs) and interest rates. Apple (AAPL) is mentioned indirectly as part of the \"Magnificent 7,\" which are described as potentially 'top-heavy,' suggesting a possible correction. While AI and Crypto are also mentioned, those don't have as clear and direct of an effect on Apple's stock price. The overall tone is cautious due to uncertainties surrounding economic outlook, potential Trump tariffs, and the Fed's decisions. The article suggests potential volatility and mixed signals, making it slightly more probable that Apple's stock may experience a short-term pullback or stagnation given possible shifts in macroeconomic policy. The 'top-heavy' comment and macroeconomic uncertainty weigh negatively, while AI growth is already largely priced into the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article, \"What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.  The article provides a definition of a market index, not any news that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause any significant movement in the Apple stock price. Any price change would be attributable to other market forces and not this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the article does not provide direct information or specific catalysts that would immediately affect its stock price. However, the broader themes discussed\u2014such as AI advancements, potential tariffs, and market sentiment\u2014could indirectly influence AAPL. Given Apple's position as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and its exposure to global markets, any negative sentiment around tariffs or market volatility could pose risks. Conversely, positive developments in AI or strong earnings season performance could benefit AAPL. The lack of direct AAPL-specific news suggests a neutral to slightly positive bias, but with significant uncertainty due to macroeconomic and political factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). TikTok's situation and Apple's stock price are not closely related in this context. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. The news is more relevant to TikTok and social media sectors rather than Apple directly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any information specific to Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could be used to estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling. The news appears to be about upcoming IPOs in 2025, which is unrelated to Apple's current stock performance. Therefore, it is unlikely that this news would have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US, as a result of President Trump's directive to allow service providers to avoid penalties if they continue supporting TikTok. This could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple Inc., as they are one of the key platform providers for TikTok. However, there is uncertainty because several high-ranking officials have stated their opposition, suggesting future challenges might arise. On the other hand, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta may benefit, which could indirectly impact Apple's positioning in the market.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok indicates a potential temporary lifting of the ban, which could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple since it plays a significant role in facilitating app distribution. This might lead to a belief that advertising revenue may continue to flow through Apple's app ecosystem rather than shifting to competitors like Meta if TikTok can remain operational. However, uncertainty remains regarding the enforcement of the law and the political landscape, which could pose risks. Considering the mixed signals and overall context, I predict a slightly higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and potential market impacts from discussions and policies, particularly those related to Trump, tariffs, interest rates, AI, and crypto. Apple is mentioned as part of the \"Magnificent 7,\" which are considered potentially \"top-heavy,\" hinting at a possible correction. The article suggests volatility ahead of earnings season, with CEOs trying to 'talk up their businesses' during potentially 'rockier markets'. The overall sentiment is somewhat mixed, with both positive and negative catalysts at play. Tariffs and interest rates could negatively impact Apple, though potential AI advancements and CEO sentiment could balance things out. Considering previous predictions leaned towards a slight fall due to the \"top-heavy\" assessment, I will slightly adjust the probabilities here. The general uncertainty and potential for market volatility associated with the issues discussed at Davos is enough to lean slightly negative on the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.  It offers no information that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Previous predictions varied widely, reflecting the influence of other news sources and analyses.  Given the irrelevance of the headline, any stock price movement would be driven solely by broader market factors or other unrelated news, not this specific article. Therefore, the probabilities of price increase or decrease due to this news are extremely low, approximating a neutral position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the article does not provide direct information or specific catalysts that would immediately affect its stock price. However, the broader themes discussed\u2014such as AI advancements, potential tariffs, and market sentiment\u2014could indirectly influence AAPL. Given Apple's position as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and its exposure to global markets, any negative sentiment around tariffs or market volatility could pose risks. Conversely, positive developments in AI or strong earnings season performance could benefit AAPL. The lack of direct AAPL-specific news suggests a neutral to slightly positive bias, but with significant uncertainty due to macroeconomic and political factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The provided news headline and content primarily focus on TikTok's situation and its resolution, which is not closely related to Apple's stock price movement. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively low. The lack of direct information about Apple or its business operations suggests that this news is unlikely to cause significant movement in Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content, 'Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025', does not contain any specific information related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) that could directly influence its stock price. The news is about upcoming IPOs, which is unrelated to Apple's current stock performance. Considering the previous predictions from other models, most of them also conclude that the news has little to no direct impact on Apple's stock price, with some models providing probabilities close to 0.5 for both rising and falling due to the lack of direct relevance. However, given the nature of the news, which does not introduce any new risks or positive catalysts specifically for Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are low and relatively balanced.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US due to President Trump's directive. This directive indicates a temporary resolution for the ongoing tension between TikTok and the US government. Since Apple Inc. operates the App Store, which is a key distribution channel for TikTok, the rollback could have a positive impact on investor sentiment towards Apple. Although there is still uncertainty due to opposition from high-ranking officials, the immediate response seems to be a stabilizing factor for the stock price. On the other hand, the potential for future regulatory challenges means that the stock price may not experience a significant boost but could stabilize.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok transitioning from a potential ban to a possible restoration of services introduces a layer of uncertainty and opportunity for Apple Inc. If TikTok can continue operating, Apple stands to benefit from the advertisement revenues that may flow through its App Store, rather than shifting to competitors like Meta. However, the political landscape remains tense, with opposing views among lawmakers suggesting the potential for future regulatory challenges. The mixed implications of this news lead to a balanced view, leaning slightly toward a positive outlook due to the immediate relief for TikTok, which could sustain Apple\u2019s revenue streams. Based on this analysis, I assess a moderate probability for the stock price to rise, with some likelihood of it falling as uncertainty persists.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and highlights several factors that could influence market sentiment. While it doesn't directly mention Apple in a positive or negative light, several themes are relevant. The 'Magnificent 7' being 'top-heavy' suggests potential downside. Concerns around Trump's potential policies (tariffs) create uncertainty. However, AI developments could provide a boost. The general anticipation of increased market volatility means that overall sentiment is more negative, and that potential downside risks outweigh potential, if indirect, upside. Given the previous predictions and the somewhat negative tone of this article regarding broader market factors, I am adjusting my prediction toward a higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.51, Reasoning: The provided news headline, \"What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?\", is completely irrelevant to Apple Inc.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely to have any impact on Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, but this is due to other news sources being conflated with this irrelevant headline in previous iterations.  Analyzing only the provided information, the stock price movement should be largely driven by unrelated factors.  The slight upward trend in predictions across rounds is caused by other, not these irrelevant headlines.  Therefore, I assign near-equal probabilities to a rise or fall reflecting the lack of influence from this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto.

Given Apple's position as a 'Magnificent 7' stock and its exposure to global markets, any negative sentiment around tariffs or market volatility could pose risks. Conversely, positive developments in AI or strong earnings season performance could benefit AAPL. The lack of direct AAPL-specific news suggests a neutral to slightly positive bias, but with significant uncertainty due to macroeconomic and political factors. Considering the previous predictions, which were mixed but leaned slightly negative due to the 'top-heavy' comment and macroeconomic uncertainty, I estimate a balanced probability for both rise and fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc.
