      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: With 61% ownership of the shares, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, positive sentiment from Wall Street and projections of strong earnings within the tech industry contribute to the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. The prediction of a 25% increase in tech stocks due to favorable conditions also supports this outlook. However, potential volatility stemming from Trump's unpredictable policies could introduce some uncertainty, which affects stock price movement. Therefore, the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is relatively low given the current trends and expectations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Davos World Economic Forum and various themes that will dominate discussions, including the potential impact of Trump's policies, interest rate outlook from big bank CEOs, tariff implications for retail companies, AI advancements and competition in the chip market, the crypto industry's perspective on recent volatility and regulatory changes, and overall market risks amidst a 'top-heavy' stock market. While Apple is not explicitly mentioned, there is oblique allusion to big tech which may be seen as positive factor. The increased uncertainty emanating from potential Trump policies, particularly regarding tariffs, represents a considerable downside risk. However, there is no specific mention of Apple's initiatives in Davos. The overall tone leans toward caution, influenced by economic and political uncertainties. Given that Davos involves discussion of broad economic and market trends rather than company specific news, the impact to any given name, even a magnificant 7 member like Apple is muted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is neutral, presenting both the positive and negative aspects of high institutional ownership.  Given the lack of specific information on the insider sales and the inherent volatility of the market, predicting a definite rise or fall in price is difficult. I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a price drop due to the potential risk of coordinated institutional selling and the negative signal from insider sales, albeit this information is limited.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content ('What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?') does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any material events that would directly impact its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have any significant effect on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok being restored and the involvement of President Trump and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in this matter has both positive and negative implications for AAPL's stock price. On the positive side, TikTok's restoration means that AAPL, as the operator of the App Store, will continue to offer TikTok for download, potentially maintaining revenue streams. Additionally, Trump's executive order aims to provide clarity and assurance to service providers like Apple. However, the uncertainty surrounding the legal basis of Trump's actions and the potential for future legal challenges create negative implications. Overall, the probabilities reflect a cautiously optimistic outlook with a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. While the article mentions various companies and their CEOs, it does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it does mention the 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which includes Apple, and notes that these stocks are beginning to look top-heavy. The article also discusses the potential for market volatility due to Trump policies and the presence of crypto and AI-related discussions at the forum. Given the lack of specific information about Apple and the general uncertainty surrounding the market, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, recent actions suggest immediate price pressures could exist. These factors suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights a generally positive outlook for the technology sector as the incoming Trump administration is expected to reduce regulations and potentially create a favorable environment for companies like Apple. This sentiment is bolstered by statements from major industry figures indicating increased confidence and optimism about economic growth. However, there is also an undercurrent of volatility associated with Trump's unpredictable policies, which could introduce some risk. The predictions from previous rounds suggest a trend of cautious optimism about Apple's stock price, with several models reflecting a tendency towards expecting a rise, though some indicate heightened risks due to institutional behaviors and market uncertainties. Considering all these factors, I assess a moderate probability for price increase amidst balanced uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article discusses the themes dominating the World Economic Forum in Davos. While Apple isn't explicitly mentioned extensively, it's part of the 'Magnificent 7' which are discussed as potentially 'top-heavy'. The article's broader themes like potential Trump tariffs, AI competition with companies like Microsoft and Google, and crypto volatility indirectly impact market sentiment. The emphasis on Trump's policies introduces uncertainty and market volatility, as does discussion of interest rates from the banking sector. The overall analysis suggests more reasons for slight bearishness on the stock market since its overall sentiments. In the previous rounds, the difference between the hightest and lowest predictions are significant, the lowest prediction of stock rising probability is 0.4, while the highest prediction is 0.75. The predictions in previous rounds demonstrates a trend of believing that stock may fall. Given that Apple is a component of the magnificent seven and that these stocks are deemed to be top heavy, the market risks generally outweigh Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock.  While this can be seen as a positive indicator of confidence from large investors, it also introduces significant volatility risk.  A large, coordinated sell-off by these institutions could cause a substantial price drop.  The mention of recent insider sales further adds to negative sentiment. The lack of specifics regarding the volume and timing of these insider sales makes it difficult to precisely quantify their impact.  Considering the potential for institutional selling pressure and the negative signal from insider sales, combined with the inherent market volatility, the probability of a price drop appears slightly higher than a price rise.  The previous predictions show a range of sentiment from cautiously optimistic to more bearish, reflecting this inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content ('What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?') does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any material events that would directly impact its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have any significant effect on AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of specific information and the neutral nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the context of specific news that would directly affect its stock price, it is part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks mentioned as beginning to look top-heavy. The article highlights various themes including Trump policies, interest rates, tariffs, AI, and crypto, which could introduce volatility and uncertainty to the market. Given the lack of specific positive or negative information about Apple and considering the general market trends and uncertainties, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling. However, since the news does not specifically target Apple Inc. with negative or positive changes, the probabilities should remain relatively balanced, reflecting the overall market uncertainty and the indirect implications of the discussed themes on a major tech company like Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, recent actions suggest immediate price pressures could exist. These factors suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news outlines a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector, particularly given the anticipated regulatory relief and tax cuts under President-elect Trump's second term. This environment is likely to benefit major tech companies, including Apple, contributing to a stronger sentiment around the stock. Despite the optimism, there are underlying risks due to Trump's unpredictability and potential market volatility, which are reflected in the varying predictions from multiple models in previous rounds. Considering that the overall market sentiment, especially for tech stocks, leans slightly towards positive, I estimate a moderate probability of price increase for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The article discusses the Davos World Economic Forum and its potential implications for the market. While Apple isn't explicitly the focus, its membership in the 'Magnificent 7,' a group described as potentially 'top-heavy,' raises concerns. The discussions about Trump's policies, tariffs, AI competition (with mentions of Microsoft and Google vying with Nvidia), crypto volatility, and interest rate outlooks all contribute to the overall market sentiment. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and the 'top-heavy' assessment of the Magnificent Seven, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted. Prior predictions show a trend towards believing the stock may fall, with increased bearishness in the last round. Insider sales and the potential for institutional selling pressure further solidify this bearish view. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be moderately higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. This is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of significant price drops if these institutions decide to sell simultaneously.  The mention of recent insider sales adds to this negative sentiment, although the lack of specifics about the volume and timing of these sales limits the assessment of their impact.  The previous predictions show considerable divergence, ranging from strongly bullish to strongly bearish, highlighting the inherent uncertainty. Considering the potential for institutional selling pressure and the negative signal from insider sales, coupled with the general market volatility, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's generally strong fundamentals and continued growth in certain sectors limit how far this probability can be weighted. The overall uncertainty suggests a relatively balanced prediction that reflects the mixed signals presented in the news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content ('What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?') does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any material events that would directly impact its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, from cautiously optimistic to bearish, but none of them are based on direct news about Apple. Given the lack of specific information and the neutral nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Considering the lack of specific positive or negative information about Apple and the general market trends and uncertainties, the probabilities should remain relatively balanced.

The analysis of previous predictions shows a range of sentiments, from cautiously optimistic to more bearish, indicating inherent uncertainty. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a balanced view with a slight lean towards a potential fall in stock price due to the overall market risks and uncertainties.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price.

While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, recent actions suggest immediate price pressures could exist. These factors suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. Previous predictions also show a range of sentiment, with some predictions leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling.
