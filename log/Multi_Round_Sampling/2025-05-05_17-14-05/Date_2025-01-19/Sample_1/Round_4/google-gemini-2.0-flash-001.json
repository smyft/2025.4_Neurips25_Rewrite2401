(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the significant political and economic ramifications tied to the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, emphasizing potential impact on stock valuations, particularly for major players like Apple. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility. However, given Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising despite potential market headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news is somewhat neutral to slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While the situation with TikTok itself doesn't directly impact Apple's core business, the fact that Trump is stepping in to potentially allow TikTok to continue operating in the US averts a negative scenario for Apple. Banning the TikTok application would have damaged Apple's reputation, potentially causing public outrage and reduced confidence in the stock. The lack of an app ban doesn't necessarily mean positive sentiment for Apple, but it suggests averted negative effects. The longer-term implications of TikTok's future are uncertain, given congressional opposition and potential future regulatory changes. As such, the stock price is unlikely to be significantly impacted in either positive or negative direction. It is important to note that the Apple app store is not completely safe, since there remains a possibility of a ban in the future which creates uncertainty. Additionally, the news cycle continues to affect Apple and TikTok, so Apple's stock price may fluctuate due to the ongoing political considerations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the positives and negatives of high institutional ownership without leaning heavily towards a bullish or bearish prediction. Considering the lack of specific information about recent insider selling and the overall balanced perspective, it is reasonable to assign only a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, reflecting the risk associated with the potential for coordinated institutional selling. However, the news alone does not provide enough information for strong prediction. Other market factors and Apple's own performance will play a far more significant role in determining the future stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more closely related to its own product launches, financial performance, and market share dynamics rather than developments in the social media space like TikTok. Therefore, this news is likely to have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that TikTok is a competitor to social media platforms and considering the broader tech landscape, one might argue there's an indirect relationship, but it's too tenuous to significantly influence Apple's stock price in this context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions several companies and their CEOs, including Apple's potential competitors in the AI space, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, who will be attending the event. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market and the possibility of CEOs challenging or trying to get on his good side. However, Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy. Given the lack of direct news about Apple and the general uncertainty surrounding the event, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, considering the potential for market-moving news and the current market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and its potential implications on the economy, particularly the uncertain political landscape with the incoming Trump administration. While Apple's presence as part of the 'Magnificent 7' suggests some market strength, the overall tone highlights potential volatility and uncertainty. Influential CEOs will provide insights into economic outlooks, particularly regarding interest rates and tariffs, which may affect investor sentiment. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and previous resilience in uncertain market conditions, I estimate a modestly higher probability for the stock price to rise. However, the presence of risks, such as political developments and market reactions to upcoming announcements, tempers this optimism. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance for a positive movement compared to a negative one.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and subsequent restoration due to Trump's intervention has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). While a complete TikTok ban could have disrupted app store dynamics (though not directly benefit Apple), the current situation maintains the status quo. The uncertainty surrounding the legal challenges from Capitol Hill and the long-term viability of a workaround adds some risk. However, the restoration of service, even temporarily, reduces the immediate negative impact on app store activity. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight overall bias toward a positive outcome or neutral impact, given the resolved immediate threat. The article also mentions potential gain for Meta (META), Reddit (RDDT), SnapChat (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) and other competitors of TikTok should it be forced to go dark.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), highlighting both the potential upside (due to institutional investor confidence) and downside (due to the risk of large-scale selling).  While high institutional ownership is generally viewed positively, the article emphasizes the risk of coordinated selling, potentially causing a significant price drop.  The mention of recent insider selling further adds to the negative sentiment. However, the lack of specifics regarding the scale and timing of these insider sales makes it difficult to quantify the impact.  Considering the balanced nature of the article and the inherent risk associated with high institutional ownership, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall than a price rise. The overall sentiment leans towards neutral to slightly negative, given the potential for large institutional investors' actions to significantly influence Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions show a spread of opinions, ranging from a 45% probability of a price fall to 70% probability of a rise, illustrating the uncertainty associated with this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc.

Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it can be inferred that the tech industry's regulatory environment and market dynamics are being closely watched. Given that the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business, product launches, or financial performance, it is reasonable to assume a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of probabilities, but most suggest a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, given the overall positive sentiment towards tech stocks and potential policy shifts under Trump that could favor large tech companies like Apple. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple and the general market trends, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy, the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies could affect the stock price. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility, but the lack of direct negative news about Apple suggests a more positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions. The consensus among other models indicates a mix of probabilities with a slight edge for falling, possibly due to uncertainties around Trump's commitments and institutional sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights significant political and economic discourse surrounding the World Economic Forum in Davos. The potential impact of Trump's policies and statements on U.S. international relations could introduce volatility in the markets. However, Apple is part of the influential 'Magnificent 7' and has historically showcased resilience amid uncertainties. The presence of major CEOs may suggest a collaborative atmosphere aimed at navigating the evolving landscape. While there are some bearish sentiments around potential market corrections, the overall strong fundamentals of Apple favor a slightly higher probability of a price rise in the near term, despite the mentioned risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's situation in the US has indirect implications for Apple. The immediate crisis of a TikTok ban is averted (at least temporarily) due to Trump's intervention, which is generally positive for Apple as it avoids potential disruptions to its app store. However, the long-term uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, the ongoing legal challenges, and congressional opposition temper any significant positive impact. Furthermore, while alternative social media platforms might benefit, Apple's gains are more indirect and less substantial. Considering the balance between averted immediate risk and lingering uncertainty, along with others' predictions, I adjust the probability slightly towards neutral, but tilting towards a rise to reflect that the averted ban reduces negative sentiment and reflects Trump and Apple's general cozying up between them.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), a double-edged sword.  While this signifies confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a substantial price drop if these institutions simultaneously sell.  The mention of recent insider selling adds to the negative sentiment, though specifics are lacking.  The news lacks a clear positive catalyst. Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 40% to 70% probability of a price rise, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the potential for significant downward pressure from coordinated institutional selling, and the lack of strong positive news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.  However, the absence of concrete detail on the insider selling and the overall strength of Apple limits the downside prediction, and a significant rise remains possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy, the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies could affect the stock price. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling.

Apple, as a key player in the App Store, may have faced some risk if TikTok was permanently banned. However, the news has outlined immediate steps that mitigate this risk, potentially reducing investor concerns. There is still ambiguity concerning the long-term implications due to political and legislative uncertainties. Other models suggest a mixture of probabilities with a slight edge for stock price stability or a minor rise owing to the mitigated immediate risk and positive sentiment from Trump's intervention.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news surrounding the World Economic Forum in Davos indicates a significant focus on the political and economic implications of the upcoming Trump administration. While Apple's presence as part of the 'Magnificent 7' suggests it is viewed favorably in the market, the overall tone surrounding volatility and uncertainty due to political developments tempers optimism. Historical trends show that Apple has maintained resilience in uncertain markets, benefiting from strong fundamentals. However, with references to potential tariffs and market dynamics discussed by industry leaders, there is a slight edge towards caution. Ultimately, given the mixed sentiments from other predictions, I estimate a modest probability of rise outweighing that of fall, but the ongoing uncertainties limit the potential for significant positive movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's situation has indirect implications for Apple. The averted immediate crisis of a TikTok ban due to Trump's intervention is mildly positive for Apple as it prevents app store disruptions. However, the long-term uncertainty concerning TikTok's future, ongoing legal hurdles, and Congressional resistance limit any substantial positive impact. While alternative social media platforms could gain users, Apple's benefits are indirect. Taking into account that it's unlikely that there will be a TikTok ban in the short term and the other users prediction trends show a slightly higher rate of rising, I increase the probability of stock price rise to 0.55. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a significant price drop if these institutions decide to sell simultaneously. The mention of recent insider selling adds to the negative sentiment, although the article lacks specifics on the extent of these sales.  The lack of other significant positive news in the article makes it difficult to assign a high probability to a price increase.  Previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the situation. Considering the potential for a large price drop due to coordinated selling by institutional investors, and the lack of compelling positive news, I lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's overall strength limits the extent of the downside prediction, and a significant rise remains possible. The analysis considers the balanced perspective of the article and the significant influence that large institutional investors can exert on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc.
