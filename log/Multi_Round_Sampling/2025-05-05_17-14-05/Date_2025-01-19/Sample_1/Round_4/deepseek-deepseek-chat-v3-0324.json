(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the significant political and economic ramifications tied to the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, emphasizing potential impact on stock valuations, particularly for major players like Apple. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility. However, given Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising despite potential market headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news is somewhat neutral to slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While the situation with TikTok itself doesn't directly impact Apple's core business, the fact that Trump is stepping in to potentially allow TikTok to continue operating in the US averts a negative scenario for Apple. Banning the TikTok application would have damaged Apple's reputation, potentially causing public outrage and reduced confidence in the stock. The lack of an app ban doesn't necessarily mean positive sentiment for Apple, but it suggests averted negative effects. The longer-term implications of TikTok's future are uncertain, given congressional opposition and potential future regulatory changes. As such, the stock price is unlikely to be significantly impacted in either positive or negative direction. It is important to note that the Apple app store is not completely safe, since there remains a possibility of a ban in the future which creates uncertainty. Additionally, the news cycle continues to affect Apple and TikTok, so Apple's stock price may fluctuate due to the ongoing political considerations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the positives and negatives of high institutional ownership without leaning heavily towards a bullish or bearish prediction. Considering the lack of specific information about recent insider selling and the overall balanced perspective, it is reasonable to assign only a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, reflecting the risk associated with the potential for coordinated institutional selling. However, the news alone does not provide enough information for strong prediction. Other market factors and Apple's own performance will play a far more significant role in determining the future stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more closely related to its own product launches, financial performance, and market share dynamics rather than developments in the social media space like TikTok. Therefore, this news is likely to have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that TikTok is a competitor to social media platforms and considering the broader tech landscape, one might argue there's an indirect relationship, but it's too tenuous to significantly influence Apple's stock price in this context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions several companies and their CEOs, including Apple's potential competitors in the AI space, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, who will be attending the event. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market and the possibility of CEOs challenging or trying to get on his good side. However, Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy. Given the lack of direct news about Apple and the general uncertainty surrounding the event, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, considering the potential for market-moving news and the current market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and its potential implications on the economy, particularly the uncertain political landscape with the incoming Trump administration. While Apple's presence as part of the 'Magnificent 7' suggests some market strength, the overall tone highlights potential volatility and uncertainty. Influential CEOs will provide insights into economic outlooks, particularly regarding interest rates and tariffs, which may affect investor sentiment. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and previous resilience in uncertain market conditions, I estimate a modestly higher probability for the stock price to rise. However, the presence of risks, such as political developments and market reactions to upcoming announcements, tempers this optimism. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance for a positive movement compared to a negative one.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and subsequent restoration due to Trump's intervention has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). While a complete TikTok ban could have disrupted app store dynamics (though not directly benefit Apple), the current situation maintains the status quo. The uncertainty surrounding the legal challenges from Capitol Hill and the long-term viability of a workaround adds some risk. However, the restoration of service, even temporarily, reduces the immediate negative impact on app store activity. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight overall bias toward a positive outcome or neutral impact, given the resolved immediate threat. The article also mentions potential gain for Meta (META), Reddit (RDDT), SnapChat (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) and other competitors of TikTok should it be forced to go dark.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), highlighting both the potential upside (due to institutional investor confidence) and downside (due to the risk of large-scale selling).  While high institutional ownership is generally viewed positively, the article emphasizes the risk of coordinated selling, potentially causing a significant price drop.  The mention of recent insider selling further adds to the negative sentiment. However, the lack of specifics regarding the scale and timing of these insider sales makes it difficult to quantify the impact.  Considering the balanced nature of the article and the inherent risk associated with high institutional ownership, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall than a price rise. The overall sentiment leans towards neutral to slightly negative, given the potential for large institutional investors' actions to significantly influence Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions show a spread of opinions, ranging from a 45% probability of a price fall to 70% probability of a rise, illustrating the uncertainty associated with this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it can be inferred that the tech industry's regulatory environment and market dynamics are being closely watched. Given that the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business, product launches, or financial performance, it is reasonable to assume a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of probabilities, but most suggest a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, given the overall positive sentiment towards tech stocks and potential policy shifts under Trump that could favor large tech companies like Apple. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple and the general market trends, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy, the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies could affect the stock price. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility, but the lack of direct negative news about Apple suggests a more positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions. The consensus among other models indicates a mix of probabilities with a slight edge for falling, possibly due to uncertainties around Trump's commitments and institutional sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights significant political and economic discourse surrounding the World Economic Forum in Davos. The potential impact of Trump's policies and statements on U.S. international relations could introduce volatility in the markets. However, Apple is part of the influential 'Magnificent 7' and has historically showcased resilience amid uncertainties. The presence of major CEOs may suggest a collaborative atmosphere aimed at navigating the evolving landscape. While there are some bearish sentiments around potential market corrections, the overall strong fundamentals of Apple favor a slightly higher probability of a price rise in the near term, despite the mentioned risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's situation in the US has indirect implications for Apple. The immediate crisis of a TikTok ban is averted (at least temporarily) due to Trump's intervention, which is generally positive for Apple as it avoids potential disruptions to its app store. However, the long-term uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, the ongoing legal challenges, and congressional opposition temper any significant positive impact. Furthermore, while alternative social media platforms might benefit, Apple's gains are more indirect and less substantial. Considering the balance between averted immediate risk and lingering uncertainty, along with others' predictions, I adjust the probability slightly towards neutral, but tilting towards a rise to reflect that the averted ban reduces negative sentiment and reflects Trump and Apple's general cozying up between them.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), a double-edged sword.  While this signifies confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a substantial price drop if these institutions simultaneously sell.  The mention of recent insider selling adds to the negative sentiment, though specifics are lacking.  The news lacks a clear positive catalyst. Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 40% to 70% probability of a price rise, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the potential for significant downward pressure from coordinated institutional selling, and the lack of strong positive news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.  However, the absence of concrete detail on the insider selling and the overall strength of Apple limits the downside prediction, and a significant rise remains possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy, the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies could affect the stock price. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility, but the lack of direct negative news about Apple suggests a more positive outlook. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of probabilities, but most suggest a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, given the overall positive sentiment towards tech stocks and potential policy shifts under Trump that could favor large tech companies like Apple.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, and how President Trump's actions have led to a temporary restoration of the service. Apple, as a key player in the App Store, may have faced some risk if TikTok was permanently banned. However, the news has outlined immediate steps that mitigate this risk, potentially reducing investor concerns. There is still ambiguity concerning the long-term implications due to political and legislative uncertainties. Other models suggest a mixture of probabilities with a slight edge for stock price stability or a minor rise owing to the mitigated immediate risk and positive sentiment from Trump's intervention.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.56, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.44, Reasoning: The news surrounding the World Economic Forum in Davos indicates a significant focus on the political and economic implications of the upcoming Trump administration. While Apple's presence as part of the 'Magnificent 7' suggests it is viewed favorably in the market, the overall tone surrounding volatility and uncertainty due to political developments tempers optimism. Historical trends show that Apple has maintained resilience in uncertain markets, benefiting from strong fundamentals. However, with references to potential tariffs and market dynamics discussed by industry leaders, there is a slight edge towards caution. Ultimately, given the mixed sentiments from other predictions, I estimate a modest probability of rise outweighing that of fall, but the ongoing uncertainties limit the potential for significant positive movement.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's situation has indirect implications for Apple. The averted immediate crisis of a TikTok ban due to Trump's intervention is mildly positive for Apple as it prevents app store disruptions. However, the long-term uncertainty concerning TikTok's future, ongoing legal hurdles, and Congressional resistance limit any substantial positive impact. While alternative social media platforms could gain users, Apple's benefits are indirect. Taking into account that it's unlikely that there will be a TikTok ban in the short term and the other users prediction trends show a slightly higher rate of rising, I increase the probability of stock price rise to 0.55. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), which is a double-edged sword. While it suggests confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a significant price drop if these institutions decide to sell simultaneously. The mention of recent insider selling adds to the negative sentiment, although the article lacks specifics on the extent of these sales.  The lack of other significant positive news in the article makes it difficult to assign a high probability to a price increase.  Previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the situation. Considering the potential for a large price drop due to coordinated selling by institutional investors, and the lack of compelling positive news, I lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's overall strength limits the extent of the downside prediction, and a significant rise remains possible. The analysis considers the balanced perspective of the article and the significant influence that large institutional investors can exert on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc.

Considering the previous predictions from various models, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, and how President Trump's actions have led to a temporary restoration of the service. Apple, as a key player in the App Store, may have faced some risk if TikTok was permanently banned. However, the news has outlined immediate steps that mitigate this risk, potentially reducing investor concerns. There is still ambiguity concerning the long-term implications due to political and legislative uncertainties. Other models suggest a mixture of probabilities with a slight edge for stock price stability or a minor rise owing to the mitigated immediate risk and positive sentiment from Trump's intervention.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.
