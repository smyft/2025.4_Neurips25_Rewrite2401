      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: With 61% ownership of the shares, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the significant political and economic ramifications tied to the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, emphasizing potential impact on stock valuations, particularly for major players like Apple. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility. However, given Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising despite potential market headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news is somewhat neutral to slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While the situation with TikTok itself doesn't directly impact Apple's core business, the fact that Trump is stepping in to potentially allow TikTok to continue operating in the US averts a negative scenario for Apple. Banning the TikTok application would have damaged Apple's reputation, potentially causing public outrage and reduced confidence in the stock. The lack of an app ban doesn't necessarily mean positive sentiment for Apple, but it suggests averted negative effects. The longer-term implications of TikTok's future are uncertain, given congressional opposition and potential future regulatory changes. As such, the stock price is unlikely to be significantly impacted in either positive or negative direction. It is important to note that the Apple app store is not completely safe, since there remains a possibility of a ban in the future which creates uncertainty. Additionally, the news cycle continues to affect Apple and TikTok, so Apple's stock price may fluctuate due to the ongoing political considerations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the positives and negatives of high institutional ownership without leaning heavily towards a bullish or bearish prediction. Considering the lack of specific information about recent insider selling and the overall balanced perspective, it is reasonable to assign only a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, reflecting the risk associated with the potential for coordinated institutional selling. However, the news alone does not provide enough information for strong prediction. Other market factors and Apple's own performance will play a far more significant role in determining the future stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more closely related to its own product launches, financial performance, and market share dynamics rather than developments in the social media space like TikTok. Therefore, this news is likely to have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that TikTok is a competitor to social media platforms and considering the broader tech landscape, one might argue there's an indirect relationship, but it's too tenuous to significantly influence Apple's stock price in this context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions several companies and their CEOs, including Apple's potential competitors in the AI space, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, who will be attending the event. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market and the possibility of CEOs challenging or trying to get on his good side. However, Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy. Given the lack of direct news about Apple and the general uncertainty surrounding the event, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, considering the potential for market-moving news and the current market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
