(AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news discusses the significant political and economic ramifications tied to the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, emphasizing potential impact on stock valuations, particularly for major players like Apple. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility. However, given Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising despite potential market headwinds.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: This news is somewhat neutral to slightly positive for Apple (AAPL). While the situation with TikTok itself doesn't directly impact Apple's core business, the fact that Trump is stepping in to potentially allow TikTok to continue operating in the US averts a negative scenario for Apple. Banning the TikTok application would have damaged Apple's reputation, potentially causing public outrage and reduced confidence in the stock. The lack of an app ban doesn't necessarily mean positive sentiment for Apple, but it suggests averted negative effects. The longer-term implications of TikTok's future are uncertain, given congressional opposition and potential future regulatory changes. As such, the stock price is unlikely to be significantly impacted in either positive or negative direction. It is important to note that the Apple app store is not completely safe, since there remains a possibility of a ban in the future which creates uncertainty. Additionally, the news cycle continues to affect Apple and TikTok, so Apple's stock price may fluctuate due to the ongoing political considerations.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the positives and negatives of high institutional ownership without leaning heavily towards a bullish or bearish prediction. Considering the lack of specific information about recent insider selling and the overall balanced perspective, it is reasonable to assign only a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, reflecting the risk associated with the potential for coordinated institutional selling. However, the news alone does not provide enough information for strong prediction. Other market factors and Apple's own performance will play a far more significant role in determining the future stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock price movement is more closely related to its own product launches, financial performance, and market share dynamics rather than developments in the social media space like TikTok. Therefore, this news is likely to have a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. However, given that TikTok is a competitor to social media platforms and considering the broader tech landscape, one might argue there's an indirect relationship, but it's too tenuous to significantly influence Apple's stock price in this context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. The article mentions several companies and their CEOs, including Apple's potential competitors in the AI space, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, who will be attending the event. The article also mentions the potential for Trump's policies to impact the market and the possibility of CEOs challenging or trying to get on his good side. However, Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy. Given the lack of direct news about Apple and the general uncertainty surrounding the event, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, considering the potential for market-moving news and the current market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and its potential implications on the economy, particularly the uncertain political landscape with the incoming Trump administration. While Apple's presence as part of the 'Magnificent 7' suggests some market strength, the overall tone highlights potential volatility and uncertainty. Influential CEOs will provide insights into economic outlooks, particularly regarding interest rates and tariffs, which may affect investor sentiment. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and previous resilience in uncertain market conditions, I estimate a modestly higher probability for the stock price to rise. However, the presence of risks, such as political developments and market reactions to upcoming announcements, tempers this optimism. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance for a positive movement compared to a negative one.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and subsequent restoration due to Trump's intervention has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). While a complete TikTok ban could have disrupted app store dynamics (though not directly benefit Apple), the current situation maintains the status quo. The uncertainty surrounding the legal challenges from Capitol Hill and the long-term viability of a workaround adds some risk. However, the restoration of service, even temporarily, reduces the immediate negative impact on app store activity. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight overall bias toward a positive outcome or neutral impact, given the resolved immediate threat. The article also mentions potential gain for Meta (META), Reddit (RDDT), SnapChat (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) and other competitors of TikTok should it be forced to go dark.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), highlighting both the potential upside (due to institutional investor confidence) and downside (due to the risk of large-scale selling).  While high institutional ownership is generally viewed positively, the article emphasizes the risk of coordinated selling, potentially causing a significant price drop.  The mention of recent insider selling further adds to the negative sentiment. However, the lack of specifics regarding the scale and timing of these insider sales makes it difficult to quantify the impact.  Considering the balanced nature of the article and the inherent risk associated with high institutional ownership, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall than a price rise. The overall sentiment leans towards neutral to slightly negative, given the potential for large institutional investors' actions to significantly influence Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions show a spread of opinions, ranging from a 45% probability of a price fall to 70% probability of a rise, illustrating the uncertainty associated with this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, are reportedly cozying up to Trump, contributing funds to his inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship with the incoming administration. Analysts like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, with less regulatory pressure and stronger AI initiatives, which could benefit Apple. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok returning after Trump's comments does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it can be inferred that the tech industry's regulatory environment and market dynamics are being closely watched. Given that the news does not directly relate to Apple's core business, product launches, or financial performance, it is reasonable to assume a neutral effect on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of probabilities, but most suggest a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling, given the overall positive sentiment towards tech stocks and potential policy shifts under Trump that could favor large tech companies like Apple. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple and the general market trends, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy, the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies could affect the stock price. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and historical resilience in uncertain markets, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. The presence of influential CEOs and potential policy changes from the Trump administration could introduce volatility, but the lack of direct negative news about Apple suggests a more positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the potential ban and reinstatement of TikTok in the US, which may affect Apple's App Store and Cloud Services operations. With assurances from President Trump and TikTok's statement that their service is being restored, there's less direct negative impact on Apple. Moreover, the potential for increased engagement from Meta's Instagram or others capturing defectors could provide indirect benefits. Yet, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty linger, possibly tempering immediate positive reactions. The consensus among other models indicates a mix of probabilities with a slight edge for falling, possibly due to uncertainties around Trump's commitments and institutional sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news highlights significant political and economic discourse surrounding the World Economic Forum in Davos. The potential impact of Trump's policies and statements on U.S. international relations could introduce volatility in the markets. However, Apple is part of the influential 'Magnificent 7' and has historically showcased resilience amid uncertainties. The presence of major CEOs may suggest a collaborative atmosphere aimed at navigating the evolving landscape. While there are some bearish sentiments around potential market corrections, the overall strong fundamentals of Apple favor a slightly higher probability of a price rise in the near term, despite the mentioned risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's situation in the US has indirect implications for Apple. The immediate crisis of a TikTok ban is averted (at least temporarily) due to Trump's intervention, which is generally positive for Apple as it avoids potential disruptions to its app store. However, the long-term uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future, the ongoing legal challenges, and congressional opposition temper any significant positive impact. Furthermore, while alternative social media platforms might benefit, Apple's gains are more indirect and less substantial. Considering the balance between averted immediate risk and lingering uncertainty, along with others' predictions, I adjust the probability slightly towards neutral, but tilting towards a rise to reflect that the averted ban reduces negative sentiment and reflects Trump and Apple's general cozying up between them.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's high institutional ownership (61%), a double-edged sword.  While this signifies confidence from large investors, it also increases the risk of a substantial price drop if these institutions simultaneously sell.  The mention of recent insider selling adds to the negative sentiment, though specifics are lacking.  The news lacks a clear positive catalyst. Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 40% to 70% probability of a price rise, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering the potential for significant downward pressure from coordinated institutional selling, and the lack of strong positive news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.  However, the absence of concrete detail on the insider selling and the overall strength of Apple limits the downside prediction, and a significant rise remains possible.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights potential policy shifts under Trump's second term, including lighter regulation and tax cuts, which are generally favorable for the technology sector, including Apple Inc.

Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling. However, the market's inherent volatility under Trump's unpredictable approach introduces some risk. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the stock market. Although Apple is only indirectly mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks that are looking top-heavy, the overall uncertainty and potential negative impact of Trump's policies could affect the stock price.

Apple, as a key player in the App Store, may have faced some risk if TikTok was permanently banned. However, the news has outlined immediate steps that mitigate this risk, potentially reducing investor concerns. There is still ambiguity concerning the long-term implications due to political and legislative uncertainties. Other models suggest a mixture of probabilities with a slight edge for stock price stability or a minor rise owing to the mitigated immediate risk and positive sentiment from Trump's intervention.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
