      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty around its stock. However, Apple's resilience as a company with strong demand could mitigate potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious stance on stock movement amidst the uncertainty presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and potential market impacts related to Trump policies, interest rates, AI, crypto, and the overall market outlook. While Apple isn't directly mentioned as a primary focus of any particular discussion at Davos, it is implicitly linked through several factors. Firstly, the article references the 'Magnificent 7' being potentially 'top-heavy'. Apple is a major constituent of this group, and any concern about this group's valuation will impact investor sentiment of AAPL. Secondly, broad interest rate outlook discussions may indirectly affect Apple, as interest rates do have an impact on big tech. Also, AI is mentioned as another major discussion area. So any positive or negative news in those spheres have a small chance of impacting AAPL. Considering these somewhat indirect connections, the analysis leads to a slightly negative outlook. The article leans more toward caution regarding market conditions and potential headwinds from Trump policies and interest rates, leading to a higher probability of a slight dip.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including banking, retail, AI, and crypto.  While it mentions several companies including Apple competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia, there's no direct mention of Apple or any specific news that would significantly affect its stock price. The article highlights potential market volatility due to Trump's policies and the \"Magnificent 7\" (which Apple is a part of) appearing top-heavy.  This general market uncertainty makes it difficult to definitively predict Apple's stock movement based solely on this article. The lack of specific Apple-related news suggests the probability of a significant price change, either up or down, is relatively low.  The overall market sentiment may influence the stock, but this news piece alone does not provide a strong basis for a confident prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant stock price movements based on their trading decisions. Institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign due to their access to capital and analytical resources, but it also introduces vulnerability if large institutions decide to sell simultaneously. The article mentions recent insider sales, which could be a bearish signal, but insider ownership is under 1%, minimizing its impact. The general public owns 37%, which is substantial but not enough to counter institutional influence. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong institutional confidence versus potential large-scale selling\u2014the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to stability or a rise due to the overall positive perception of institutional ownership.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its specific business operations, financial performance, or any announced developments that could impact its stock price. The news appears to be a general overview of upcoming IPOs in 2025, which does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or any factors that would directly influence its stock price. As a result, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Apple is mentioned as one of the stocks owned by Buffett, but it's not considered the best for income investors due to its low dividend yield. However, Buffett has praised Apple as 'an even better business' than some of his other long-term holdings, and it's Berkshire's largest holding. The article does not contain any significantly negative information about Apple, and the overall tone is neutral to positive. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, as the mention of Apple in a positive light alongside other successful stocks could have a slight positive impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US, as a result of President Trump's directive to allow service providers to avoid penalties if they continue supporting TikTok. This could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple Inc., as they are one of the key platform providers for TikTok. However, there is uncertainty because several high-ranking officials have stated their opposition, suggesting future challenges might arise. On the other hand, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta may benefit, which could indirectly impact Apple's positioning in the market.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the World Economic Forum in Davos highlights potential volatility in the market due to various factors, including Trump policies, tariffs, and interest rates. Although Apple is not the main focus, it is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and could be affected indirectly by the discussions and sentiment surrounding these broader issues. The overall tone of the news suggests caution and uncertainty about market conditions, which typically favors a lower probability of stock price increase. Given the mixed influences and the current market environment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.43, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.57, Reasoning: The news article provides a broad overview of topics to be discussed at Davos, including Trump policies, interest rates, AI, crypto, and the Magnificent 7 stocks, of which Apple is a part. While Apple is not directly mentioned, the overall market uncertainty and potential headwinds from Trump policies could impact the stock. The mention of the 'Magnificent 7' being potentially 'top-heavy' is also a potential concern. Given these overarching themes, I am adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly more negative outlook than some of the previous rounds. However, the fact that many predictions hovered around 0.4-0.6 for rise/fall indicates a general consensus of uncertainty, suggesting significant movement in either direction is unlikely based solely on this article.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Davos World Economic Forum and its potential impact on various sectors, but lacks specific information directly affecting Apple.  While Apple is indirectly implicated through mentions of the 'Magnificent Seven', interest rates, and AI, the overall impact is uncertain. The article highlights potential market volatility stemming from Trump-related policies and general concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven', which could negatively affect Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong position and resilience might mitigate these effects.  The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise and 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price fall, indicating significant uncertainty and a balanced outlook. Considering the lack of direct Apple-specific news in the provided article and the prevailing uncertainty reflected in previous predictions, I lean toward a neutral prediction with slightly higher probability of a price fall, reflecting potential market volatility and general concern about the tech sector.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant stock price movements based on their trading decisions.

The content appears to be general information about upcoming IPOs and does not contain any direct references to Apple's business operations, financial performance, or announced developments that could impact its stock price. Given the lack of specific information related to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced with a slight inclination towards stability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Apple is mentioned as one of the stocks owned by Buffett, but it's not considered the best for income investors due to its low dividend yield. However, Buffett has praised Apple as 'an even better business' than some of his other long-term holdings, and it's Berkshire's largest holding. Considering the positive mention of Apple alongside other successful stocks and the lack of significantly negative information, the overall tone is neutral to positive. This could have a slight positive impact on investor sentiment. Additionally, the analysis of previous predictions shows a range of opinions, but most models seem to suggest a neutral or slightly positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US, as a result of President Trump's directive to allow service providers to avoid penalties if they continue supporting TikTok.

This implies that market sentiment could be cautious, especially with discussions of potential volatility influencing investor outlook. Although Apple may not be the direct focus of the discussions, its association with broader tech sector concerns contributes to an uncertain market environment. Given the emphasis on potential risks and negative sentiments surrounding tariffs and economic policies, the overall probabilities lean towards a higher risk of stock price decline despite Apple's strong market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and mentions several factors that could influence the market, including Trump's policies, interest rates, discussions around AI, and crypto. While Apple is not directly mentioned, it is an element of the 'Magnificent 7', and views of this group influence investor sentiment. The article also suggests the 'Magnificent 7' is top-heavy, so it will suffer. Given that broad interests rate discussions have an impact on big tech and potentially negative news in the tariffs have a chance of impacting Apple, and the possible overall uncertainties that could affect market conditions. The previous rounds of predictions leaned slightly negative or neutral, reflecting the general uncertainty in this article, so I will go with negative.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Davos World Economic Forum and its potential impact on various sectors, with indirect implications for Apple.  Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7,' and concerns about this group's valuation, interest rate discussions, and the overall market outlook could influence its stock. However, the lack of specific Apple-related news makes it challenging to predict a significant price movement.  The prevailing uncertainty, reflected in the previous predictions ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 probability for both price rise and fall, suggests that a significant change in either direction is unlikely. The overall tone suggests caution and potential market volatility. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher chance of a minor price decline due to general market uncertainty, reflecting the broader economic and political discussions at Davos, and the potential for negative sentiment towards the 'Magnificent 7' as a whole.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant stock price movements based on their trading decisions.

The news article also mentions that competitors like Meta could benefit if TikTok remains banned. Taking into account the mixed reactions from officials and the potential positive and negative impacts on Apple's standing in the market, the overall impact seems to tilt towards a moderately positive outlook.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news surrounding the World Economic Forum in Davos indicates several uncertainties, particularly regarding Trump policies, tariffs, and the overall economic outlook. Although Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7', which is highlighted as potentially 'top-heavy', there is no specific positive news about Apple itself. The general market environment appears cautious, which suggests a slightly higher probability of a price decline as investor sentiment could be negatively influenced by the discussion of tariffs and economic policies. Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, this analysis leads to an estimated probability of a decline in stock price being higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential market impact, particularly regarding Trump's policies, tariffs, interest rates, AI, crypto, and the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Apple is a component of the 'Magnificent 7', making it indirectly influenced by discussions and sentiments surrounding these broader issues and market volatility. There is also concern that the 'Magnificent 7' might be 'top heavy'. Prior predictions reveal a general trend toward a cautious outlook, indicating a balanced (although leaning negative) view on the stock's trajectory despite Apple's market strength. The mixed potential impacts of these factors suggest an increase in probability of stock price decreasing. Round 0's deepseek had a point about ownership percentage which is interesting, but the news content provided to it was different. The majority now believe probability of falling is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the Davos World Economic Forum and its potential impact on various sectors, including banking, retail, AI, and crypto. While Apple (AAPL) is not the central focus, its inclusion in the 'Magnificent 7' makes it indirectly susceptible to market sentiment surrounding the broader economic and political discussions.  The overall tone suggests potential volatility due to Trump's policies, interest rates, and general market outlook. The 'Magnificent 7' are described as potentially 'top-heavy,' suggesting some concern over their valuations.  However, Apple's strong market position and resilience might mitigate some negative impacts.  Analysis of previous predictions shows a range from 0.4 to 0.6 probability for both price increase and decrease.  This reflects significant uncertainty and a general consensus that a major price swing is unlikely based solely on this article. Considering the indirect exposure and overall uncertainty, I assign slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise, reflecting the potential for negative sentiment toward the tech sector, concerns about general market volatility, and the unclear impacts of Trump's policies and interest rates.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant stock price movements based on their trading decisions.

The previous predictions from various models also suggest a range of opinions but generally indicate a neutral or slightly cautious outlook due to broader market uncertainties and indirect implications. Therefore, the probabilities are balanced with a slight inclination towards stability, but given the overall neutral tone and lack of direct impact, a slight edge is given to a potential rise due to the positive perception of Apple's institutional ownership and its strong market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, focusing on the best pick for income investors.
