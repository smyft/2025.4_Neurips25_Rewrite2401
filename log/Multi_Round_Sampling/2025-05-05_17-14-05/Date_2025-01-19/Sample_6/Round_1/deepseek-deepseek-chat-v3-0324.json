(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty around its stock. However, Apple's resilience as a company with strong demand could mitigate potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious stance on stock movement amidst the uncertainty presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and potential market impacts related to Trump policies, interest rates, AI, crypto, and the overall market outlook. While Apple isn't directly mentioned as a primary focus of any particular discussion at Davos, it is implicitly linked through several factors. Firstly, the article references the 'Magnificent 7' being potentially 'top-heavy'. Apple is a major constituent of this group, and any concern about this group's valuation will impact investor sentiment of AAPL. Secondly, broad interest rate outlook discussions may indirectly affect Apple, as interest rates do have an impact on big tech. Also, AI is mentioned as another major discussion area. So any positive or negative news in those spheres have a small chance of impacting AAPL. Considering these somewhat indirect connections, the analysis leads to a slightly negative outlook. The article leans more toward caution regarding market conditions and potential headwinds from Trump policies and interest rates, leading to a higher probability of a slight dip.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including banking, retail, AI, and crypto.  While it mentions several companies including Apple competitors like Microsoft and Nvidia, there's no direct mention of Apple or any specific news that would significantly affect its stock price. The article highlights potential market volatility due to Trump's policies and the \"Magnificent 7\" (which Apple is a part of) appearing top-heavy.  This general market uncertainty makes it difficult to definitively predict Apple's stock movement based solely on this article. The lack of specific Apple-related news suggests the probability of a significant price change, either up or down, is relatively low.  The overall market sentiment may influence the stock, but this news piece alone does not provide a strong basis for a confident prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights that institutional investors own 61% of Apple's shares, which can lead to significant stock price movements based on their trading decisions. Institutional ownership is generally seen as a positive sign due to their access to capital and analytical resources, but it also introduces vulnerability if large institutions decide to sell simultaneously. The article mentions recent insider sales, which could be a bearish signal, but insider ownership is under 1%, minimizing its impact. The general public owns 37%, which is substantial but not enough to counter institutional influence. Given the mixed signals\u2014strong institutional confidence versus potential large-scale selling\u2014the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge to stability or a rise due to the overall positive perception of institutional ownership.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its specific business operations, financial performance, or any announced developments that could impact its stock price. The news appears to be a general overview of upcoming IPOs in 2025, which does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or any factors that would directly influence its stock price. As a result, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be neutral, with a slight inclination towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's ownership of six Dow Jones stocks, with a focus on the best pick for income investors. Apple is mentioned as one of the stocks owned by Buffett, but it's not considered the best for income investors due to its low dividend yield. However, Buffett has praised Apple as 'an even better business' than some of his other long-term holdings, and it's Berkshire's largest holding. The article does not contain any significantly negative information about Apple, and the overall tone is neutral to positive. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, as the mention of Apple in a positive light alongside other successful stocks could have a slight positive impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential rollback on the ban of TikTok in the US, as a result of President Trump's directive to allow service providers to avoid penalties if they continue supporting TikTok. This could positively influence investor sentiment towards Apple Inc., as they are one of the key platform providers for TikTok. However, there is uncertainty because several high-ranking officials have stated their opposition, suggesting future challenges might arise. On the other hand, if TikTok remains banned, competitors like Meta may benefit, which could indirectly impact Apple's positioning in the market.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
