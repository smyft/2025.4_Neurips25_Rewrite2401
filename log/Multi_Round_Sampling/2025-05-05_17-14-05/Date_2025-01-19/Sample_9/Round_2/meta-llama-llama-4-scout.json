(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty around its stock. However, Apple's resilience as a company with strong demand could mitigate potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious stance on stock movement amidst the uncertainty presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on upcoming IPOs in 2025 and does not directly relate to Apple's current business operations or financial performance. While IPOs can indirectly affect market sentiment and investor appetite for tech stocks in general, the link to Apple is weak. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely negligible. A neutral stance is appropriate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed. While he criticizes Zuckerberg's assessment of Apple's post-Jobs innovation, calling it \"one of the most offensive interviews I've heard,\" he doesn't offer a concrete negative outlook on Apple's stock.  The news piece focuses more on other market factors (California wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) and Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's business practices. Cramer's overall commentary is not strongly bullish or bearish on AAPL specifically. The negative sentiment from Zuckerberg is countered by the lack of substantial negative commentary from Cramer, and the article itself notes that Apple remains a significant player with many hedge fund holders. Given this lack of clear direction from the news, the probabilities lean towards a slightly higher likelihood of no significant price movement rather than a dramatic rise or fall. Thus, relatively even probabilities are assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its robust financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach add credibility to the recommendation. The company reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating strong financial health. Additionally, Apple's integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. Given these positive factors, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and potential reprieve from President Trump has implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company operates the App Store where TikTok is available. The news does not directly impact Apple's core business or financials but can be seen as a slight positive for Apple as it shows the company is complying with the law and Trump's administration is open to negotiations. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the indirect nature of the news. The probability of a significant stock price movement is low, but if there is a movement, it is more likely to be positive than negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology. The article mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the World Economic Forum in Davos, tariffs, AI, crypto, and Trump's policies. These elements introduce market uncertainties affecting broad indices rather than a single company like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While specific impacts on AAPL aren't highlighted, the overall market sentiment could potentially affect its stock price depending on broader economic outcomes or CEO presentations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum and the political landscape surrounding economic policies and tariffs, which can introduce uncertainty in the market. Apple's stock price may be affected by broader market sentiments during this period. However, the focus on tech and AI at Davos could be beneficial for Apple, given its involvement in these sectors. With the mixed signals from previous predictions and the importance of upcoming earnings season, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise reflecting potential positive sentiment and good earnings, balanced by the market volatility introduced by political developments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on IPOs in 2025. This has very little to do with Apple's current stock price. In the first round, models mostly assigned probabilities close to 0.5, indicating no anticipated movement. I also consider that many models may have access to information that I am not. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assign probabilities close to 0.5.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical comments about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death.  Cramer finds Zuckerberg's statements \"offensive\" but doesn't offer a strong bearish prediction for Apple's stock. The article also mentions various other market factors (wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) which could impact Apple indirectly but are not directly tied to the company's performance.  While Zuckerberg's comments are negative, their impact is mitigated by the lack of concrete negative predictions from Cramer and the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's continued strong presence in the market and significant hedge fund holdings.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting significant uncertainty and a lack of clear directional bias from this news alone. Therefore, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most plausible, considering Apple's resilience and the lack of strong negative signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach lend credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, the integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. While previous predictions varied, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to these factors. However, broader market conditions and economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology.

Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that Apple's stock is likely to rise due to the positive sentiment from Big Tech leaders and the expected favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the World Economic Forum in Davos, tariffs, AI, crypto, and Trump's policies.
