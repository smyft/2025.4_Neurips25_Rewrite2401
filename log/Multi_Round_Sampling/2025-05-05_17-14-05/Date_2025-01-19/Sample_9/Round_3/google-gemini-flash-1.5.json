(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty around its stock. However, Apple's resilience as a company with strong demand could mitigate potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious stance on stock movement amidst the uncertainty presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on upcoming IPOs in 2025 and does not directly relate to Apple's current business operations or financial performance. While IPOs can indirectly affect market sentiment and investor appetite for tech stocks in general, the link to Apple is weak. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely negligible. A neutral stance is appropriate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed. While he criticizes Zuckerberg's assessment of Apple's post-Jobs innovation, calling it \"one of the most offensive interviews I've heard,\" he doesn't offer a concrete negative outlook on Apple's stock.  The news piece focuses more on other market factors (California wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) and Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's business practices. Cramer's overall commentary is not strongly bullish or bearish on AAPL specifically. The negative sentiment from Zuckerberg is countered by the lack of substantial negative commentary from Cramer, and the article itself notes that Apple remains a significant player with many hedge fund holders. Given this lack of clear direction from the news, the probabilities lean towards a slightly higher likelihood of no significant price movement rather than a dramatic rise or fall. Thus, relatively even probabilities are assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its robust financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach add credibility to the recommendation. The company reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating strong financial health. Additionally, Apple's integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. Given these positive factors, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and potential reprieve from President Trump has implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company operates the App Store where TikTok is available. The news does not directly impact Apple's core business or financials but can be seen as a slight positive for Apple as it shows the company is complying with the law and Trump's administration is open to negotiations. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the indirect nature of the news. The probability of a significant stock price movement is low, but if there is a movement, it is more likely to be positive than negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology. The article mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the World Economic Forum in Davos, tariffs, AI, crypto, and Trump's policies. These elements introduce market uncertainties affecting broad indices rather than a single company like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While specific impacts on AAPL aren't highlighted, the overall market sentiment could potentially affect its stock price depending on broader economic outcomes or CEO presentations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum and the political landscape surrounding economic policies and tariffs, which can introduce uncertainty in the market. Apple's stock price may be affected by broader market sentiments during this period. However, the focus on tech and AI at Davos could be beneficial for Apple, given its involvement in these sectors. With the mixed signals from previous predictions and the importance of upcoming earnings season, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise reflecting potential positive sentiment and good earnings, balanced by the market volatility introduced by political developments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on IPOs in 2025. This has very little to do with Apple's current stock price. In the first round, models mostly assigned probabilities close to 0.5, indicating no anticipated movement. I also consider that many models may have access to information that I am not. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assign probabilities close to 0.5.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical comments about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death.  Cramer finds Zuckerberg's statements \"offensive\" but doesn't offer a strong bearish prediction for Apple's stock. The article also mentions various other market factors (wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) which could impact Apple indirectly but are not directly tied to the company's performance.  While Zuckerberg's comments are negative, their impact is mitigated by the lack of concrete negative predictions from Cramer and the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's continued strong presence in the market and significant hedge fund holdings.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting significant uncertainty and a lack of clear directional bias from this news alone. Therefore, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most plausible, considering Apple's resilience and the lack of strong negative signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach lend credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, the integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. While previous predictions varied, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to these factors. However, broader market conditions and economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology. The article mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that Apple's stock is likely to rise due to the positive sentiment from Big Tech leaders and the expected favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the World Economic Forum in Davos, tariffs, AI, crypto, and Trump's policies. These elements introduce market uncertainties affecting broad indices rather than a single company like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While specific impacts on AAPL aren't highlighted, the overall market sentiment could potentially affect its stock price depending on broader economic outcomes or CEO presentations. The previous predictions show a mix of opinions with some models leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise while others suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will address significant economic issues including tariffs and AI, both of which impact tech companies like Apple. While there is uncertainty due to political implications and potential market volatility, Apple's established presence in the AI sector and strong financial health provide some support for a potential stock price increase. Previous predictions were mixed, indicating cautious optimism. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses upcoming IPOs in 2025. This information is unlikely to have a direct and immediate impact on Apple's stock price. IPOs generally influence the overall market sentiment and investor appetite for tech stocks, but the correlation with Apple is weak. Most previous rounds assigned probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting negligible anticipated movement. Considering the nature of the news and past predictions, my estimation remains largely neutral. However, slight negative consideration is given that investors' intention might shift from large stablished company like Apple to companies participating in IPOs.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical comments about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs.  Zuckerberg's comments are overtly negative, portraying Apple as stagnant and anti-competitive. However, Cramer, while acknowledging the negativity, doesn't issue a strong sell recommendation.  The news also covers various other macroeconomic factors (California wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) that could influence the market generally, but not specifically target Apple.  The article itself highlights Apple's substantial number of hedge fund holders, suggesting continued institutional confidence.  Previous model predictions are mixed, showing a lack of clear consensus on the impact of this news.  Given the contradictory signals \u2013 negative comments from Zuckerberg countered by a lack of a strong negative reaction from Cramer and the ongoing institutional investment \u2013 I believe the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. A slight negative bias is introduced due to Zuckerberg's public criticism; however, this is balanced by the lack of stronger negative sentiment from a credible market analyst like Cramer and the broader positive factors indicating ongoing institutional confidence. Thus, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price holding steady or experiencing only minor downward movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach lend credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, the integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. While previous predictions varied, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to these factors. However, broader market conditions and economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses TikTok's temporary shutdown in the US and the potential reprieve from President Trump. This situation indirectly affects Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company operates the App Store where TikTok is available. The news indicates that Apple is complying with the law, and Trump's administration is open to negotiations. This compliance and the potential for a reprieve could be seen as a slight positive for Apple, as it shows the company is adhering to legal requirements and has a positive relationship with the administration. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the indirect nature of the news. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, reflecting potential positive sentiment, balanced by the market volatility introduced by political developments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology.
