(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will feature major executives and global economic discussions likely impacting market sentiment. The focus on tariffs, Trump policies, and economic forecasts may introduce volatility in the market. Given that Apple is a significant player in technology and supply chain, discussions about tariffs and the economic outlook might create uncertainty around its stock. However, Apple's resilience as a company with strong demand could mitigate potential negative impacts. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious stance on stock movement amidst the uncertainty presented in the news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on upcoming IPOs in 2025 and does not directly relate to Apple's current business operations or financial performance. While IPOs can indirectly affect market sentiment and investor appetite for tech stocks in general, the link to Apple is weak. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price is likely negligible. A neutral stance is appropriate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed. While he criticizes Zuckerberg's assessment of Apple's post-Jobs innovation, calling it \"one of the most offensive interviews I've heard,\" he doesn't offer a concrete negative outlook on Apple's stock.  The news piece focuses more on other market factors (California wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) and Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's business practices. Cramer's overall commentary is not strongly bullish or bearish on AAPL specifically. The negative sentiment from Zuckerberg is countered by the lack of substantial negative commentary from Cramer, and the article itself notes that Apple remains a significant player with many hedge fund holders. Given this lack of clear direction from the news, the probabilities lean towards a slightly higher likelihood of no significant price movement rather than a dramatic rise or fall. Thus, relatively even probabilities are assigned.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its robust financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach add credibility to the recommendation. The company reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating strong financial health. Additionally, Apple's integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. Given these positive factors, the stock is likely to experience upward momentum in the short to medium term. However, market conditions and broader economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's temporary shutdown and potential reprieve from President Trump has implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company operates the App Store where TikTok is available. The news does not directly impact Apple's core business or financials but can be seen as a slight positive for Apple as it shows the company is complying with the law and Trump's administration is open to negotiations. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the indirect nature of the news. The probability of a significant stock price movement is low, but if there is a movement, it is more likely to be positive than negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology. The article mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the World Economic Forum in Davos, tariffs, AI, crypto, and Trump's policies. These elements introduce market uncertainties affecting broad indices rather than a single company like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While specific impacts on AAPL aren't highlighted, the overall market sentiment could potentially affect its stock price depending on broader economic outcomes or CEO presentations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum and the political landscape surrounding economic policies and tariffs, which can introduce uncertainty in the market. Apple's stock price may be affected by broader market sentiments during this period. However, the focus on tech and AI at Davos could be beneficial for Apple, given its involvement in these sectors. With the mixed signals from previous predictions and the importance of upcoming earnings season, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise reflecting potential positive sentiment and good earnings, balanced by the market volatility introduced by political developments.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on IPOs in 2025. This has very little to do with Apple's current stock price. In the first round, models mostly assigned probabilities close to 0.5, indicating no anticipated movement. I also consider that many models may have access to information that I am not. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assign probabilities close to 0.5.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical comments about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death.  Cramer finds Zuckerberg's statements \"offensive\" but doesn't offer a strong bearish prediction for Apple's stock. The article also mentions various other market factors (wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) which could impact Apple indirectly but are not directly tied to the company's performance.  While Zuckerberg's comments are negative, their impact is mitigated by the lack of concrete negative predictions from Cramer and the overall positive sentiment stemming from Apple's continued strong presence in the market and significant hedge fund holdings.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting significant uncertainty and a lack of clear directional bias from this news alone. Therefore, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is most plausible, considering Apple's resilience and the lack of strong negative signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach lend credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, the integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. While previous predictions varied, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to these factors. However, broader market conditions and economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology. The article mentions that Big Tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, are cozying up to Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI. Additionally, Wedbush's Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech. This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that Apple's stock is likely to rise due to the positive sentiment from Big Tech leaders and the expected favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the World Economic Forum in Davos, tariffs, AI, crypto, and Trump's policies. These elements introduce market uncertainties affecting broad indices rather than a single company like Apple Inc. (AAPL). While specific impacts on AAPL aren't highlighted, the overall market sentiment could potentially affect its stock price depending on broader economic outcomes or CEO presentations. The previous predictions show a mix of opinions with some models leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise while others suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to uncertainties.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos, which will address significant economic issues including tariffs and AI, both of which impact tech companies like Apple. While there is uncertainty due to political implications and potential market volatility, Apple's established presence in the AI sector and strong financial health provide some support for a potential stock price increase. Previous predictions were mixed, indicating cautious optimism. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses upcoming IPOs in 2025. This information is unlikely to have a direct and immediate impact on Apple's stock price. IPOs generally influence the overall market sentiment and investor appetite for tech stocks, but the correlation with Apple is weak. Most previous rounds assigned probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting negligible anticipated movement. Considering the nature of the news and past predictions, my estimation remains largely neutral. However, slight negative consideration is given that investors' intention might shift from large stablished company like Apple to companies participating in IPOs.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical comments about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs.  Zuckerberg's comments are overtly negative, portraying Apple as stagnant and anti-competitive. However, Cramer, while acknowledging the negativity, doesn't issue a strong sell recommendation.  The news also covers various other macroeconomic factors (California wildfires, interest rates, AI regulations) that could influence the market generally, but not specifically target Apple.  The article itself highlights Apple's substantial number of hedge fund holders, suggesting continued institutional confidence.  Previous model predictions are mixed, showing a lack of clear consensus on the impact of this news.  Given the contradictory signals \u2013 negative comments from Zuckerberg countered by a lack of a strong negative reaction from Cramer and the ongoing institutional investment \u2013 I believe the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. A slight negative bias is introduced due to Zuckerberg's public criticism; however, this is balanced by the lack of stronger negative sentiment from a credible market analyst like Cramer and the broader positive factors indicating ongoing institutional confidence. Thus, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price holding steady or experiencing only minor downward movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, emphasizing its strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives. Navellier's reputation and quantitative approach lend credibility to the recommendation. Apple reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase and a 15% rise in operating income, indicating robust financial health. Additionally, the integration of AI technologies and commitment to sustainability could attract investor interest. While previous predictions varied, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to these factors. However, broader market conditions and economic factors could introduce some volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses TikTok's temporary shutdown in the US and the potential reprieve from President Trump. This situation indirectly affects Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company operates the App Store where TikTok is available. The news indicates that Apple is complying with the law, and Trump's administration is open to negotiations. This compliance and the potential for a reprieve could be seen as a slight positive for Apple, as it shows the company is adhering to legal requirements and has a positive relationship with the administration. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the indirect nature of the news. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, reflecting potential positive sentiment, balanced by the market volatility introduced by political developments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors, including technology.

The previous predictions show a mix of opinions with some models leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise while others suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to uncertainties.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos, which highlights key economic issues including tariffs and AI\u2014factors that could significantly affect technology companies like Apple. While there are uncertainties stemming from political developments and market volatility, Apple's established position in AI and strong financial health are likely to support its stock. The mixed predictions from previous rounds indicate both optimism and caution, yet there's an overall trend leaning towards a higher probability of stock price increases as tech companies engage positively with regulatory discussions. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by considerations of broader market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on IPOs in 2025, which has a very indirect and weak connection to Apple's current stock price. IPOs could affect the general investor sentiment, but the impact on Apple is likely negligible. The predictions from previous rounds generally hover around 0.5, indicating an expectation of no significant stock movement. There's a slight chance that some investors might shift focus from established companies like Apple towards the new IPOs, so I'll assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. Taking all aspects into consideration, there would be a slight decrease in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Zuckerberg's comments are strongly negative, but Cramer, while acknowledging the negativity, doesn't offer a strong sell recommendation.  The article also highlights Apple's large number of hedge fund holders, suggesting sustained institutional confidence. Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty.  While Zuckerberg's criticism is a significant negative factor, its impact is tempered by the lack of a strong bearish counter-reaction from Cramer and the ongoing institutional investment.  The significant number of hedge fund holders and Apple's overall market position suggest resilience against short-term negative sentiment. Therefore the probabilities favor a slightly higher chance of the stock price holding steady or experiencing only a minor downward adjustment than a significant rise. The overall uncertainty and lack of a decisively negative or positive outlook from key market analysts leads to a probability distribution closer to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.

However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive due to the indirect nature of the news. The previous predictions from various models show a mix of opinions, with some assigning higher probabilities to a stock price rise and others to a fall. Given the compliance of Apple with the law and the potential positive sentiment from Trump's administration being open to negotiations, there is a moderate probability of the stock price rising.
