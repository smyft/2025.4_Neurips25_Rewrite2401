(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Stock playbook for Trump's second term: Top sector winners and losers\nNews Content: Investors brace for a bumpy ride as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts \u2014 including lighter regulation and tax cuts.\n\nThose two priorities have Wall Street upbeat, while cooling inflation and strong earnings have also fueled investor optimism. This past week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) clocked its best weekly performance since the election. Since Nov. 5, the S&P 500 has climbed 3.6%.\n\nYet some areas of the market could be at risk, as Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with several top CEOs and Wall Street analysts about what Trump 2.0 means for businesses and investors. Here\u2019s what they told me about the incoming administration\u2019s expected impact across various sectors.\n\nWinning trades under Trump: Financials, industrials, airlines, crypto\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade as investors bet on looser regulation and increased M&A activity. Just this week, the nation\u2019s largest banks reported a surge in corporate profits.\n\n\"There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the US election,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said on the bank\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025.\"\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum cited a \u201csignificant amount of increase of optimism in the overall environment,\u201d telling reporters following the bank\u2019s earnings results that \u201cwe\u2019re in an animal-spirits moment right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have a more level, less volatile regulatory environment,\u201d Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told me on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Morning Brief. \u201cHaving banks manage their business on whether or not [Senator] Elizabeth Warren is going to attack them or not is absurd. You can't run a business that way.\u201d\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Mac Sykes expects lighter oversight of the banking industry to be a catalyst for the group, telling Yahoo Finance that deregulation will \u201cbenefit the banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a 10% hit that was coming [from Basel III endgame], and that probably will go to neutral,\u201d Sykes said. He also added that increased M&A within the sector will allow smaller players to take advantage of synergies, an outcome that\u2019s being \u201cunderappreciated by investors.\u201d\n\nIndustrials\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie told me last month that the industrial sector is gaining confidence after months of contraction, adding \u201cseveral companies are expecting better growth in 2025 \u2026 It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHEICO (HEI) co-president Eric Mendelson is among the group\u2019s business leaders who see Trump\u2019s policies boosting investor confidence in the economy, creating a \u201cvery positive environment\u201d for the industrial sector.\n\nAnd Elon Musk\u2019s influence on the incoming administration could be another catalyst. Robert Cardillo, chief strategist of Planet Labs (PL), told me last month at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference that Musk\u2019s impact will likely be \u201cgood news\u201d for the sector.\n\nAirlines\n\nIndustry leaders and experts are expecting the incoming administration to create a supportive backdrop for the sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constructive in a lot of ways \u2026 The tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry,\u201d Southwest (LUV) CEO Bob Jordan told me last month.\n\nAnd industry watchers are predicting significant changes to the air transportation and aerospace sector, including plans to scale back the Biden administration's consumer protection initiatives and reduce regulations affecting the commercial space and advanced air mobility industries, according to recent analysis from Pillsbury law firm\u2019s aviation team.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate seeing support from the Trump Administration for joint-ventures, mergers and/or acquisition efforts by smaller airlines to compete more effectively with the larger U.S. airlines,\u201d Pillsbury\u2019s Charles Donley, Edward Sauer, and Laura Jennings Ochoa wrote.\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed by top industry analysts.\n\n\u201cBetween the new administration\u2019s stance as well as some of the smaller airlines struggling, there's a better chance of M&A now \u2026 that's an upside for the group and definitely a higher likelihood in 2025 than what we've seen these past few years,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Savanthi Syth told me.\n\nTech\n\nBig Tech leaders are cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump due to his plans to peel back regulations and invest heavily in AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella are among tech leaders who contributed funds to Trump\u2019s inauguration campaign as Big Tech tries to win the backing of the new administration.\n\nNasdaqGS - Delayed Quote\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n612.77\n\n-\n\n+(0.24%)\n\nAt close: January 17 at 4:00:01 PM EST  METAAAPL GOOGL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives expects the technology sector to be a big winner this year, predicting a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario for Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe expect tech stocks to be up 25% in 2025 as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump in the White House with Khan/FTC days in the rear-view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance\u2019s Invest conference that he\u2019s hopeful the incoming Trump administration will foster \u201ca lot more innovation and less regulation,\u201d laying the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n\n\u201cIf we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A. \u2026 If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nLosing trades under Trump: Automakers, retailers, construction\n\nAutomakers\n\nPlans by the incoming administration to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s EV policies on day one, along with threats of tariffs, pose a risk to the automotive sector.\n\nTom Donnelly, president and CEO of Mazda North American Operations, told me it\u2019s \u201cpotentially\u201d more difficult to do business under Trump given the unpredictability surrounding his administration and the potential for more tariffs. He told Yahoo Finance that Mazda has been \u201cscenario planning\u201d for months, which includes potentially shifting some of its production from Mexico to its plant in Alabama.\n\n\u201cUncertainty isn\u2019t beneficial,\u201d Donnelly told me. \u201cWhat's clear is no business in any industry can absorb the magnitude of what's being talked about here.\u201d\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has threatened a slew of tariffs, ranging from a gradual implementation to a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico, in particular, are expected to be an overhang for the auto sector this year. Evercore\u2019s Chris McNally remains \u201crelatively cautious\u201d on the entire legacy auto group until there\u2019s a resolution on Trump\u2019s tariff threats, warning of an earnings hit to some of the industry\u2019s largest players.\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors (GM) has the highest negative EPS exposure to a 25% Mexico Tariff in the whopping range of 45%-50% EPS hit if implemented,\u201d McNally wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan sees Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior as a risk to the industry and expects Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs to \u201ccontinue to pressure\u201d auto stocks until the industry gains some clarity.\n\nDiscount retailers\n\nDiscount retailers are among the stocks most at risk of tariffs, as the group relies heavily on Chinese imports.\n\nFor example, nearly a third of products sold at Boot Barn (BOOT) are produced in China, while 25% are produced in Mexico, according to recent analysis from Bank of America\u2019s Christopher Nardone.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Michael Creedon noted on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call that the retailer has policies in place to mitigate risk associated with tariffs, including the ability to \u201celiminate the product altogether.\u201d\n\nConstruction\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, along with tariffs, is a risk to the construction industry.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants could increase costs for materials and labor. Higher tariffs on China could slow its economy, causing land developers to slow their investments,\u201d S&P Global Ratings wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe team notes that softwood lumber, which is used to frame buildings, is often imported from Canada, while drywall and cement component gypsum is often imported from both Mexico and Canada.\n\nAnd that sentiment was echoed by Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner, who warned that higher costs will slow building activity.\n\n\u201cPolicy initiatives of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised tariffs on imported goods that include construction materials and mass deportations that will impact builders\u2019 labor forces, surely have come into play as builders slow down in terms of initiating new building projects,\u201d Berner wrote.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, positive sentiment from Wall Street and projections of strong earnings within the tech industry contribute to the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. However, given the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility, there is also a small chance of a negative impact. Overall, the probability of a price rise is higher due to the prevailing optimism about lighter regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is about upcoming IPOs in 2025 and does not directly mention or relate to Apple Inc. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price should be negligible. While IPOs can sometimes be indicative of overall market sentiment, this single headline provides insufficient direct information to significantly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the situation factually without strong positive or negative bias.  Considering the potential for large institutional sell-offs alongside the negative signal of insider selling, the probability of a price fall, although not decisively high, is considered slightly higher than a price rise.  This analysis is limited by the lack of specific details on the insider selling and the absence of other relevant market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Therefore, the news is considered neutral and unlikely to impact AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses various market-moving topics that will be addressed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, including Trump's policies, tariffs, AI, and crypto. However, there is no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific news that would significantly impact its stock price. Given that the news is more focused on general market trends and not specifically on Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement of Apple will be less affected by this news. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its strong financial performance, integration of AI innovations, and commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing. Given Navellier's reputation for identifying high-growth stocks and the positive factors highlighted in the article, it is reasonable to infer that this news could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns in a shorter time frame, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for the technology sector overall, which is beneficial for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is a major player in that space. The expectation of lighter regulations and support for AI initiatives under President-elect Trump's administration casts a positive light on Big Tech. Analysts predict a significant upswing for technology stocks in the coming years, and since Apple is well-positioned within this sector, the probability of its stock price rising is notably higher. However, there remains a concern regarding potential market volatility due to Trump's unpredictable nature, which introduces some risk of a price fall. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on upcoming IPOs in 2025. This information is not directly related to Apple's current financial performance or immediate prospects. While a healthy IPO market can signal broader economic optimism, its impact on an established company like Apple is indirect and likely minimal in the short term. The previous rounds of predictions show varied interpretations, ranging from optimistic assessments based on perceived tech sector support to neutral stances recognizing the lack of a direct link to Apple. Given the lack of a direct connection and considering the context provided by previous predictions, the sentiment leans slightly towards neutral. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is nearly equal, with a very slight nudge towards the possibility of positive future sentiment. However, there is no direct cause with Apple. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock.  While this can be interpreted as a positive signal reflecting institutional confidence, it also highlights a significant risk factor.  Large-scale selling by these institutions could trigger a substantial price drop. The mention of recent insider sales further adds to the negative sentiment. However, the news lacks crucial details such as the volume and timing of these insider sales, limiting the assessment's precision.  The overall tone is neutral, presenting facts without strong positive or negative bias. Considering the potential for coordinated institutional selling and the negative signal from insider sales, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the absence of concrete details makes a definitive prediction challenging.  The previous predictions show varying opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall or neutrality. Considering the inherent uncertainty and the lack of strong directional indicators within the news itself, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the potential for a negative market reaction from institutional selling.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content, 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?', does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Therefore, the news is considered neutral and unlikely to impact AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are equal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific news that would significantly impact its stock price. The discussion revolves around the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the global market, including topics like Trump's policies, tariffs, AI, and crypto. However, the general tone of the news seems to be more focused on overall market trends and the performance of tech companies in general. Given that there is no direct mention of Apple or its competitors, and considering the current market conditions and sentiment, the news is considered neutral. The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the general optimism about the tech sector and the global economy. However, without specific details on how Apple's stock might be directly affected, the prediction leans towards a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its strong financial performance, integration of AI innovations, and commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing. Given Navellier's reputation for identifying high-growth stocks and the positive factors highlighted in the article, it is reasonable to infer that this news could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns in a shorter time frame, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors and the overall positive tone of the article, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the events surrounding TikTok and its relationship with the US government, particularly under former President-elect Donald Trump. While the news indirectly touches upon regulatory issues and the involvement of President-elect Trump, it doesn't directly pertain to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions show varied opinions, ranging from neutral to potentially optimistic due to Trump administration policies favoring tech companies. However, since there is no information explicitly related to Apple Inc., the impact on AAPL's stock price is more likely to be minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
