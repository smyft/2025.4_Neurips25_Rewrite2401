(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, positive sentiment from Wall Street and projections of strong earnings within the tech industry contribute to the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. However, given the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility, there is also a small chance of a negative impact. Overall, the probability of a price rise is higher due to the prevailing optimism about lighter regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline is about upcoming IPOs in 2025 and does not directly mention or relate to Apple Inc. Therefore, the immediate impact on Apple's stock price should be negligible. While IPOs can sometimes be indicative of overall market sentiment, this single headline provides insufficient direct information to significantly influence Apple's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights the significant institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock. While high institutional ownership can be seen as positive, indicating confidence from large investors, it also introduces a risk factor.  Large institutional investors selling simultaneously could trigger a significant price drop.  The news also mentions recent insider sales, which is a negative signal. However, the article itself does not provide specifics on the volume or timing of these sales, which would significantly influence the impact. The overall tone of the article is relatively neutral; it presents the situation factually without strong positive or negative bias.  Considering the potential for large institutional sell-offs alongside the negative signal of insider selling, the probability of a price fall, although not decisively high, is considered slightly higher than a price rise.  This analysis is limited by the lack of specific details on the insider selling and the absence of other relevant market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Therefore, the news is considered neutral and unlikely to impact AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses various market-moving topics that will be addressed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, including Trump's policies, tariffs, AI, and crypto. However, there is no direct mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific news that would significantly impact its stock price. Given that the news is more focused on general market trends and not specifically on Apple, it's reasonable to assume that the stock price movement of Apple will be less affected by this news. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) being one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its strong financial performance, integration of AI innovations, and commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing. Given Navellier's reputation for identifying high-growth stocks and the positive factors highlighted in the article, it is reasonable to infer that this news could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article also mentions that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns in a shorter time frame, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive outlook for the technology sector overall, which is beneficial for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is a major player in that space. The expectation of lighter regulations and support for AI initiatives under President-elect Trump's administration casts a positive light on Big Tech. Analysts predict a significant upswing for technology stocks in the coming years, and since Apple is well-positioned within this sector, the probability of its stock price rising is notably higher. However, there remains a concern regarding potential market volatility due to Trump's unpredictable nature, which introduces some risk of a price fall. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on upcoming IPOs in 2025. This information is not directly related to Apple's current financial performance or immediate prospects. While a healthy IPO market can signal broader economic optimism, its impact on an established company like Apple is indirect and likely minimal in the short term. The previous rounds of predictions show varied interpretations, ranging from optimistic assessments based on perceived tech sector support to neutral stances recognizing the lack of a direct link to Apple. Given the lack of a direct connection and considering the context provided by previous predictions, the sentiment leans slightly towards neutral. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is nearly equal, with a very slight nudge towards the possibility of positive future sentiment. However, there is no direct cause with Apple. \nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership (61%) of Apple stock.  While this can be interpreted as a positive signal reflecting institutional confidence, it also highlights a significant risk factor.  Large-scale selling by these institutions could trigger a substantial price drop. The mention of recent insider sales further adds to the negative sentiment. However, the news lacks crucial details such as the volume and timing of these insider sales, limiting the assessment's precision.  The overall tone is neutral, presenting facts without strong positive or negative bias. Considering the potential for coordinated institutional selling and the negative signal from insider sales, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the absence of concrete details makes a definitive prediction challenging.  The previous predictions show varying opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall or neutrality. Considering the inherent uncertainty and the lack of strong directional indicators within the news itself, a relatively neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the potential for a negative market reaction from institutional selling.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content, 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?', does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any direct factors that could influence its stock price. The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not provide actionable insights for AAPL's stock movement. Therefore, the news is considered neutral and unlikely to impact AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are equal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any company-specific news that would significantly impact its stock price. The discussion revolves around the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and its potential impact on the global market, including topics like Trump's policies, tariffs, AI, and crypto. However, the general tone of the news seems to be more focused on overall market trends and the performance of tech companies in general. Given that there is no direct mention of Apple or its competitors, and considering the current market conditions and sentiment, the news is considered neutral. The probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the general optimism about the tech sector and the global economy. However, without specific details on how Apple's stock might be directly affected, the prediction leans towards a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing its strong financial performance, integration of AI innovations, and commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing.

However, the article also mentions that there may be other stocks with greater promise for delivering higher returns in a shorter time frame, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors and the overall positive tone of the article, the probability of the stock price rising due to this news is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the events surrounding TikTok and its relationship with the US government, particularly under former President-elect Donald Trump. While the news indirectly touches upon regulatory issues and the involvement of President-elect Trump, it doesn't directly pertain to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Previous predictions show varied opinions, ranging from neutral to potentially optimistic due to Trump administration policies favoring tech companies. However, since there is no information explicitly related to Apple Inc., the impact on AAPL's stock price is more likely to be minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector due to the expected policy changes under President-elect Trump's administration, including lighter regulation and support for AI initiatives. Apple Inc. (AAPL), as a significant player in the tech sector, stands to benefit from this positive sentiment. Analysts project a favorable future for tech stocks, which suggests a higher likelihood of stock price increases for companies like Apple. However, there remains a degree of uncertainty due to the unpredictability of Trump's approach and potential market volatility. Considering this analysis, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on IPOs in 2025, which has an indirect impact on Apple. The previous rounds showed a mixed response, with most gravitating toward a near-neutral position, acknowledging the lack of a direct link to Apple. However, a healthy IPO market generally indicates investor confidence, which could subtly benefit established players like Apple. Given this indirect and potentially lagged positive effect, I lean slightly more positive compared to explicitly neutral. Also, others' prediction have been quite split, indicating a high volatility or high dependency on hidden factors. Thus, I make an conservative prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the high institutional ownership of Apple (61%), highlighting both the potential for significant price movements based on their collective actions and the implied confidence in the company from these investors.  The mention of recent insider selling is a negative factor, though the lack of specifics on the sale's volume and timing limits its impact assessment.  The overall news is rather neutral, presenting facts without strong bias. Analyzing previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in this situation. The high institutional ownership represents a double-edged sword: While it suggests confidence, it also increases vulnerability to coordinated selling. Given the lack of strongly positive news and the potential for negative reactions to large-scale selling by institutions, I favor a slightly pessimistic outlook, although the uncertainty remains high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'What Is the Nasdaq Composite Index?' does not provide any direct information or context about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The Nasdaq Composite Index is a broad market index that includes many companies, and general information about it does not offer specific insights into AAPL's stock movement. Previous predictions from various models reflect a range of opinions, from neutral to slightly positive or negative, but none strongly correlate the news with AAPL's performance. Given the lack of direct relevance and the neutral nature of the news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
