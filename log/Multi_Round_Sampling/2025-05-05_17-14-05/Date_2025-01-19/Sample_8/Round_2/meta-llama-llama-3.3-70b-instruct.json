(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok says 'in the process of restoring service' after going dark in US, citing Trump 'clarity'\nNews Content: TikTok said Sunday afternoon it was in the process of restoring service to its US users after going dark overnight when a new law banning the app took effect at midnight.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday afternoon, TikTok said, \"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.\"\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump asked tech companies to \"not let TikTok stay dark\" and reiterated his plan to issue a reprieve once he takes office.\n\n\"I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.\"\n\nTikTok's statement followed roughly two hours later.\n\nBeginning late Saturday, US TikTok users were shown a message saying the app wasn't available, citing the new law.\n\nThe alert also mentioned Trump by name saying, \"We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\"\n\nOn its website, TikTok told users they could still login to download their data. As of Sunday afternoon, that message had been updated to read: \"We're working hard to resolve this issue. Thank you for your patience.\"TikTok went dark Saturday night, just ahead of a ban on Sunday. (Source: Yahoo Finance/Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nStill, many on Capitol Hill \u2014 not to mention outside experts \u2014 questioned whether Trump will have the authority to make good on these promises.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest political allies are also the most outspoken critics of TikTok, and have so far stood by the law that they passed last April with strong bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a statement early Sunday, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said, \"now that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date.\" Cotton added earlier this week on the Senate floor that \"there will be no extension, no concession, and no compromises for TikTok.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, another top Trump ally, also raised questions Sunday, telling NBC he wanted to see the current law enforced and that he is \"really heartened to see that Google and Apple and Microsoft have taken the steps to comply with the law.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump, TikTok, and US lawmakers will remain in acute relief on Monday, with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew expected to be in attendance at inauguration events.\n\nRolling shutdown\n\nAccess to TikTok began getting cut off for some US users about 90 minutes before the new law took effect late Saturday. The app was also unavailable via Apple's App Store in the hours leading up to midnight. Videos intermittently loaded on TikTok for a time, but the app also showed a blacked-out screen indicating network issues.\n\nSaturday night's rolling cutoff for US TikTok users followed a report from The Information which said Oracle (ORCL), which manages TikTok's US servers, was set to begin shutting down servers that host TikTok's data as early as 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe law that has resulted in TikTok's shutdown doesn't outright ban the app, but rather it prohibits users from accessing the platform through app stores, like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and cloud services unless parent company ByteDance sells itself to an owner that is not controlled by a country the US considers adversarial.\n\nCongress has accused ByteDance of having close ties to the Chinese government and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party could force the company to provide it with information on US users or otherwise spread propaganda on the platform.\n\nBut the outcry from users and TikTok's backers forced President Joe Biden and Trump to respond. Even with Trump's assurances Apple and Google that his administration won't enforce the law, it's not guaranteed that his \u2014 or any other administration \u2014 would do so in the future. Each time the companies don't comply with the law they'd have to pay a fine of $5,000 each time a user accesses the social media app.\n\nTrump will have to either convince Congress to overturn the ban or find some other way to work around it if he wants to keep the service up and running, and neither of those is simple.\n\n'It's a good thing for Meta'\n\nShould TikTok's ban eventually come to pass, one of the biggest winners could be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics: Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram, owned by Meta, could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies have been chasing TikTok\u2019s formula in an attempt to copy the social media platform\u2019s success for some time. Reddit (RDDT), for example, offers its own short-form video feed that could entice former TikTok users looking for a broader kind of social media site complete with various message boards and communities.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) could also grab users who would have otherwise spent time on TikTok \u2014 and the advertising dollars that follow. But as Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak points out, Snap would have to ensure it can keep those TikTok refugees coming back over and over again \u2014 as TikTok does \u2014 if it hopes to hold onto that ad revenue.\n\nPinterest (PINS) also stands to get a boost if TikTok is forced to go dark. While the app doesn\u2019t have much in common with TikTok as far as overall design, it could offer an opportunity for online retailers looking to drum up e-commerce sales, something TikTok has managed to do thanks to its army of influencers.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nWith additional reporting from Ben Werschkul.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses broader trends and uncertainties at the World Economic Forum, particularly concerning geopolitical risks and corporate sentiment regarding the incoming administration's policies. Specific mentions of interest rates, tariffs, and economic outlooks could potentially sway investor sentiment negatively, particularly for companies perceived to be vulnerable to these factors. Given that AAPL is part of the Magnificent 7 which is described as looking 'top-heavy', there is room for a decline amidst prevailing uncertainties. Thus, there is a moderate probability of a stock price decline associated with this news, while the potential for a rise appears limited due to the overall market sentiment highlighted in the article.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and potential market-moving events. While Apple isn't directly mentioned as a key topic, the general market sentiment discussed can influence Apple's stock. The article highlights potential challenges from Trump policies, tariff implications, and the possibility of 'top-heavy' stocks (including the Mag 7, which Apple is a part of). On the other hand, discussions about AI, where Apple is striving to be relevant, and the general optimism that CEOs try to exude before earnings season could be positive. The uncertainty surrounding new Trump policies and the cautious sentiment regarding overvalued stocks suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term, especially given the reference to 'volatile market conditions'. However, positive AI discussion and CEO optimism may buffer the fall. The article does not contain explicit Apple-specific information that would cause a positive impact. Given these considerations, a slight decline is more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments are mixed. While he criticizes Zuckerberg's assessment of Apple's post-Jobs innovation, calling it \"one of the most offensive interviews I've heard,\" he doesn't offer a concrete negative outlook on Apple's stock.  The news article focuses more on the California wildfires and their broader economic impact, and on Cramer's discussion of interest rates and the political climate. The mention of Apple is largely in the context of Zuckerberg's criticism, which, while negative, may not significantly impact the stock price given Apple's overall market position and continued profitability.  The article also highlights the large number of hedge funds holding AAPL stock, suggesting sustained institutional confidence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction due *specifically* to this news is relatively low. The dominant factors affecting AAPL are likely to be broader market forces and the company's own performance, rather than this particular news item. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7,' the article does not provide specific information or developments directly related to Apple that would significantly influence its stock price. The broader market sentiment discussed (e.g., AI, tariffs, Fed policy) could have indirect effects, but without Apple-specific news, the impact is likely neutral. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news are balanced and low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown of TikTok in the US due to a new law and the potential for President Trump to issue an executive order to extend the period before the law's prohibitions take effect. This situation may impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the company's App Store is involved in the distribution of the TikTok app. However, the article also suggests that other companies like Meta (META), Snapchat (SNAP), and Pinterest (PINS) could potentially benefit from a TikTok ban. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for Apple to be affected indirectly, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is difficult to determine with certainty. Nevertheless, since Apple's involvement is more related to the App Store and the company has a diverse range of products and services, the impact on its stock price might be minimal. Therefore, the probabilities are estimated based on the assumption that the news might have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock due to the potential loss of app revenue, but the effect is expected to be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news discusses the World Economic Forum and the uncertain geopolitical climate surrounding tariffs, economic policies related to the Trump administration, and overall market sentiment, particularly regarding 'top-heavy' stocks. Although Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7,' which suggests strength, the fear of rising tariffs and interest rates could negatively impact investor sentiment. With concerns about overvaluation in tech stocks and the current volatile market conditions, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline. However, discussions around AI, where Apple is striving to make a strong mark, could provide some positive sentiment, though not enough to offset the broader concerns. Thus, the probabilities lean towards a higher chance of a price decline versus an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The article discusses the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and potential market-moving events. While Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Magnificent 7' which is beginning to look 'top-heavy', the article offers broader trends and uncertainties. Apple isn't a central topic but the general market sentiment, influenced by potential challenges from Trump policies, tariff implications, and volatile market conditions, can influence Apple if the market has a downturn. However, discussions around AI, in which AAPL seeks to strengthen its position, and positive CEO sentiment might counteract negativity. The previous rounds show a slight inclination towards a fall initially, but there's a slight increase to 'neutral' then back to a fall as the discussion continues. Taking these factors and previous predictions into account, there's still a slightly higher chance of a decrease given the uncertainty flagged in the article and its effect on overall market sentiment, which could impact AAPL.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's reaction to Mark Zuckerberg's critical comments about Apple's innovation since Steve Jobs' death.  Cramer finds Zuckerberg's statements highly offensive but doesn't directly predict a negative impact on Apple's stock price.  The article also mentions other significant factors like California wildfires and interest rate hikes, which have broader economic implications potentially overshadowing the impact of Zuckerberg's comments. The previous round's predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. While Zuckerberg's critique could negatively affect sentiment, Apple's market position and diverse product line likely buffer against a significant drop.  Considering the mixed signals and the influence of broader market factors, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to this specific news item alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on the World Economic Forum in Davos and its potential impact on various sectors, including technology, banking, retail, and crypto.

Navellier's reputation and track record lend credibility to his recommendations. Additionally, Apple's strong financial performance, AI innovations, and environmental initiatives suggest positive fundamentals. However, it currently ranks as the fifth pick in Navellier's list, possibly indicating that others might see higher potential in other stocks. Previous predictions suggest mixed sentiments, with a generally lower probability of stock price increase due to broader market sentiments and uncertainties.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
