(NASDAQ:AAPL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners\nNews Content: Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 61% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple NasdaqGS:AAPL Ownership Breakdown January 19th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.NasdaqGS:AAPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January 19th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Apple has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, positive sentiment from Wall Street and projections of strong earnings within the tech industry contribute to the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. However, given the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility, there is also a small chance of a negative impact. Overall, the probability of a price rise is higher due to the prevailing optimism about lighter regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's strong financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, Neural Engine), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are all positive factors that could attract investors. Navellier's reputation as a successful growth investor adds further weight to the positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that some other stocks hold \"greater promise for delivering higher returns ... within a shorter time frame.\" This suggests that while Apple is a solid long-term pick, it may not be the most explosive growth stock in Navellier's portfolio. Plus the article is from an aggregator website and not new primary research from a investment bank. Overall this is slightly positive news, but only provides a marginal boost.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the temporary ban initially presented a potential positive for Apple (due to lost app store revenue from TikTok and potential gains for competing platforms), Trump's intervention and subsequent clarification removes the short term negative impact for Apple.  The article highlights the uncertainty around the long-term future of TikTok in the US, suggesting continued legal battles.  While other social media companies may benefit from TikTok's potential downfall, this indirect benefit is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price. The long term impact of the situation on Apple is unclear, and the initial positive effect from the temporary removal is now diminished by the resolution. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this specific news is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple, the overall tone of the news is mixed, touching on broader economic concerns like interest rates and wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely neutral to slightly negative, given the criticism from a high-profile CEO like Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any fundamental financial data or significant positive catalysts for Apple, so the probability of a stock price rise is low. Conversely, the negative commentary could slightly weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a modest probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the strong performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dominance in the technology industry, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). The article also mentions Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, which could lead to new revenue streams. Additionally, the article notes that Apple is one of the companies that pays dividends, although the yield is relatively small. Given the positive outlook for the technology industry and Apple's position within it, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, the recent sales highlight potential risks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
