(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends From a $350,000 Investment in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks\nNews Content: The technology companies nicknamed the \"Magnificent Seven\" have a combined value of $17.2 trillion, which represents one-third of the entire value of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Those stocks delivered an average return of 60% during 2024, making them responsible for more than half of the S&P's 25% gain.NVDA data by YCharts.\n\nIn other words, investors whose portfolios didn't include the Magnificent Seven stocks last year probably underperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Since these seven companies dominate different areas of the technology industry, including new segments like artificial intelligence (AI), they are likely to continue driving the S&P 500 higher.\n\nBut some investors don't just want massive capital gains. They want regular income, and some Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. Unfortunately, as you'll see below, dividend investors won't get big payouts even from a massive $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nWhat's driving the Magnificent Seven now\n\nAI is the primary growth driver across most of the tech sector right now, which is why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven last year. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the top choice for those who are developing AI models, and demand is outstripping supply because every tech company needs them to keep up with the competition.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are among Nvidia's biggest customers. They are filling their data centers with Nvidia's chips to develop their own AI software, but they also rent computing capacity to businesses and other AI developers. Their customers can also access state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic via Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has embedded AI into its recommendation engines on Facebook and Instagram with the goal of more accurately curating the content they deliver to each user to suit their preferences. This keeps people online for longer periods of time, which allows Meta to show them more ads and earn more revenue. And later this year, it expects to launch its Llama 4 LLM, which could be the most advanced in the industry.\n\nThen there is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is on track to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers through its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. The company recently debuted its Apple Intelligence software with a suite of new features that work only on its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. Apple Intelligence will create new opportunities for the company to generate software revenue, and also may encourage customers to upgrade their devices sooner.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFinally, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) might be known as one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric vehicles, but Wall Street is increasingly bullish about the prospects of its full self-driving software (FSD), which could transform the company's economics. FSD will power the new Cybercab, a robotaxi that will offer fully autonomous ride-hailing services to earn revenue for Tesla around the clock in the future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay modest dividends\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies are cash-generating machines. Some of them make so much money that they can't possibly reinvest it all back into their businesses to drive growth, so they return it to shareholders. Some of that money goes toward paying dividends.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet pay dividends quarterly. However, none of them has a dividend yield of more than 0.75% based on their recent share prices.MSFT Dividend Yield data by YCharts.\n\nYields change regularly for two reasons: First, a company might raise or lower its dividend payment. Second, a stock might rise or fall in value, which would change its yield on paper. It doesn't mean the payout changes in dollar terms, it just changes as a percentage of the current value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers investors the highest yield among the group, and although it may seem small at face value, the company paid out a whopping $21.7 billion in dividends during its last fiscal year (which ended June 30). Because Microsoft has a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, though, that translates into a relatively small yield.\n\nIf you invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock), you would earn an average dividend yield of 0.37% on $250,000, while earning no yield on the other $100,000 (because Amazon and Tesla don't offer a dividend). That works out to total annual dividend payments across the portfolio of about $925.\n\nThat's a paltry sum even compared to what you could earn in a high-yield savings account with your bank right now. However, it's a nice bonus on top of the incredible capital growth.\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven return more capital to shareholders\n\nDividends aren't the only way for companies to reward shareholders. They can also use stock buybacks, repurchasing their own shares on the open market. This shrinks the number of shares in circulation, which should organically increase the price per share proportionately. In the end, each remaining shareholder effectively owns a larger slice of the company than they did before.\n\nStock buybacks are also flexible. Companies can execute them at times of their choosing, such as when they view their shares as being undervalued.\n\nBecause of those benefits, repurchases make a much larger portion of the capital returned to shareholders in Magnificent Seven stocks than dividends. Five of the Magnificent Seven companies have repurchased stock over the last four quarters, spending a combined $236.9 billion:AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon and Tesla haven't been buying back stock lately, but both are profitable, so it might be an option for them in the future. Plus, Amazon repurchased $6 billion worth of stock back in 2022, so it's no stranger to handing some cash back to investors this way.\n\nWith all of that said, the best reason to own the Magnificent Seven stocks is their incredible track record of delivering capital growth. That's likely to continue for the foreseeable future because the AI revolution is still in its early stages, and depending on which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add somewhere between $15.7 trillion (PwC) and $200 trillion (Ark Invest) to the global economy by 2030.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven will play an important role in creating that value, so investors should definitely consider owning these stocks for the long term. Any dividend payments they receive along the way will just be a bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, positive sentiment from Wall Street and projections of strong earnings within the tech industry contribute to the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. However, given the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility, there is also a small chance of a negative impact. Overall, the probability of a price rise is higher due to the prevailing optimism about lighter regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's strong financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, Neural Engine), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are all positive factors that could attract investors. Navellier's reputation as a successful growth investor adds further weight to the positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that some other stocks hold \"greater promise for delivering higher returns ... within a shorter time frame.\" This suggests that while Apple is a solid long-term pick, it may not be the most explosive growth stock in Navellier's portfolio. Plus the article is from an aggregator website and not new primary research from a investment bank. Overall this is slightly positive news, but only provides a marginal boost.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the temporary ban initially presented a potential positive for Apple (due to lost app store revenue from TikTok and potential gains for competing platforms), Trump's intervention and subsequent clarification removes the short term negative impact for Apple.  The article highlights the uncertainty around the long-term future of TikTok in the US, suggesting continued legal battles.  While other social media companies may benefit from TikTok's potential downfall, this indirect benefit is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price. The long term impact of the situation on Apple is unclear, and the initial positive effect from the temporary removal is now diminished by the resolution. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this specific news is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple, the overall tone of the news is mixed, touching on broader economic concerns like interest rates and wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely neutral to slightly negative, given the criticism from a high-profile CEO like Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any fundamental financial data or significant positive catalysts for Apple, so the probability of a stock price rise is low. Conversely, the negative commentary could slightly weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a modest probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the strong performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dominance in the technology industry, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). The article also mentions Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, which could lead to new revenue streams. Additionally, the article notes that Apple is one of the companies that pays dividends, although the yield is relatively small. Given the positive outlook for the technology industry and Apple's position within it, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, the recent sales highlight potential risks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector due to expected regulatory rollbacks and favorable policies under President-elect Trump. Apple, being a major player in the tech sector, is likely to benefit from this environment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a price rise driven by optimism in the technology sector. Given the positive sentiment surrounding tech stocks and Apple's strong position, the likelihood of the stock price rising appears greater than it falling. While uncertainty remains due to Trump's unpredictable policies, the overall sentiment gives a notable edge to price increases.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's robust financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are positive factors. However, it is only ranked 5th in Navellier's picks, and the article implies that other stocks may have better shorter term return prospects. Analysis of previous round predictions shows a wide range of sentiment, with an average rise prediction 0.49, and a fall prediction of 0.40. Given the positive but not overwhelming news and considering previous model predictions, I'm giving slightly more weight to a potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the temporary disruption and subsequent restoration of TikTok's service in the US.  While the initial shutdown could have been interpreted as potentially beneficial to Apple (through reduced App Store competition and potential increased usage of competing platforms), Trump's intervention and TikTok's quick restoration largely negated this short-term impact. The ongoing uncertainty regarding TikTok's long-term future in the US is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in the short term.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  The long-term impact on Apple is indirect and unclear.  Considering the lack of a direct, significant impact on Apple from this news and the general market volatility, the probability of a significant price movement (rise or fall) is considered low. We favor a slightly higher probability of no change or a minor price increase due to the overall resolution and avoidance of any protracted negative impact, but this effect is likely minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

The article does not provide any fundamental financial data or significant positive catalysts for Apple, so the probability of a stock price rise is low. Conversely, the negative commentary could slightly weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a modest probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the technology sector is expected to benefit from lighter regulations and increased investment in AI. Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, have contributed to Trump's inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship. Analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, expecting tech stocks to rise 25% in 2025. However, the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility could pose risks. Overall, the positive outlook on the tech sector and Apple's strong position within it suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights the strong performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dominance in the technology industry, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).

Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to positive outlooks for Apple's stock, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the potential for growth in the AI sector, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
