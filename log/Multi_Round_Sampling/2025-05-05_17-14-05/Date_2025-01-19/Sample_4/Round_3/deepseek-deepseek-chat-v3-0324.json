(AAPL): \u2018I Think When You Say Stuff Like Nothing\u2019s Been Done Since Steve Jobs Died, I Think That\u2019s An Ill-advised Strategy To Take I Think\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \"Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\"\n\nHe added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \"I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't.\" He added \"And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\" The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \"you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \"The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\"\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's \"Not enough talk about the fires.\" The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \"I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\" Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \"But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results.\"\n\nOne industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \"Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nHe added \"And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \"Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\" Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \"But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\"\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him \"Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against\" the iPhone designer. He added \"It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \"Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. .\u00a0 .it's a libertarian love fest.\"\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \"Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun.\" However, Cramer added, \"At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having.\" He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\"And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics giant that earns billions of dollars through its iconic iPhone. The smartphone is also a central part of its hypothesis as half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue comes from it. The firm's reliance on the iPhone and its closed ecosystem came under fire from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Zuckerberg said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) hadn't innovated since the death of its iconic founder Steve Jobs. Cramer took aim at these and other comments made by Zuckerberg:\n\n\"[On Zuckerberg saying Apple hasn't done anything since the iPhone] I. . [laughs hysterically] don't know what to say. I mean, David, look, I don't want to make it too central an issue because it was a love fest, a libertarian love fest, uh but David the one thing [that] is absolutely certain was that if you really want to say the most horrible things about Apple, you say first of all that nothing's been done since Jobs, two that they lock out everything, three that they make every single innovation, hold it.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at\u00a0Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector as President-elect Trump's administration is expected to reduce regulations and support sectors like tech, which includes Apple Inc. Additionally, positive sentiment from Wall Street and projections of strong earnings within the tech industry contribute to the likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. However, given the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility, there is also a small chance of a negative impact. Overall, the probability of a price rise is higher due to the prevailing optimism about lighter regulations.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's strong financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence, Siri improvements, Neural Engine), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are all positive factors that could attract investors. Navellier's reputation as a successful growth investor adds further weight to the positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that some other stocks hold \"greater promise for delivering higher returns ... within a shorter time frame.\" This suggests that while Apple is a solid long-term pick, it may not be the most explosive growth stock in Navellier's portfolio. Plus the article is from an aggregator website and not new primary research from a investment bank. Overall this is slightly positive news, but only provides a marginal boost.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary shutdown and subsequent restoration of TikTok in the US due to a new law.  While the temporary ban initially presented a potential positive for Apple (due to lost app store revenue from TikTok and potential gains for competing platforms), Trump's intervention and subsequent clarification removes the short term negative impact for Apple.  The article highlights the uncertainty around the long-term future of TikTok in the US, suggesting continued legal battles.  While other social media companies may benefit from TikTok's potential downfall, this indirect benefit is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price. The long term impact of the situation on Apple is unclear, and the initial positive effect from the temporary removal is now diminished by the resolution. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this specific news is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple, the overall tone of the news is mixed, touching on broader economic concerns like interest rates and wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely neutral to slightly negative, given the criticism from a high-profile CEO like Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any fundamental financial data or significant positive catalysts for Apple, so the probability of a stock price rise is low. Conversely, the negative commentary could slightly weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a modest probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the strong performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dominance in the technology industry, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). The article also mentions Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, which could lead to new revenue streams. Additionally, the article notes that Apple is one of the companies that pays dividends, although the yield is relatively small. Given the positive outlook for the technology industry and Apple's position within it, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant institutional ownership and recent insider sales, which can impact Apple's stock price. Given that 61% of the stock is held by institutions, institutional movements could lead to volatility. Additionally, insider sales indicate caution among top executives. While institutional holdings typically stabilize stock price, the recent sales highlight potential risks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates a generally optimistic outlook for the technology sector due to expected regulatory rollbacks and favorable policies under President-elect Trump. Apple, being a major player in the tech sector, is likely to benefit from this environment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a price rise driven by optimism in the technology sector. Given the positive sentiment surrounding tech stocks and Apple's strong position, the likelihood of the stock price rising appears greater than it falling. While uncertainty remains due to Trump's unpredictable policies, the overall sentiment gives a notable edge to price increases.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple as one of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, citing the company's robust financial performance (revenue and operating income growth), AI integration (Apple Intelligence), and commitment to sustainability (recycled materials). These are positive factors. However, it is only ranked 5th in Navellier's picks, and the article implies that other stocks may have better shorter term return prospects. Analysis of previous round predictions shows a wide range of sentiment, with an average rise prediction 0.49, and a fall prediction of 0.40. Given the positive but not overwhelming news and considering previous model predictions, I'm giving slightly more weight to a potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news focuses on the temporary disruption and subsequent restoration of TikTok's service in the US.  While the initial shutdown could have been interpreted as potentially beneficial to Apple (through reduced App Store competition and potential increased usage of competing platforms), Trump's intervention and TikTok's quick restoration largely negated this short-term impact. The ongoing uncertainty regarding TikTok's long-term future in the US is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price in the short term.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  The long-term impact on Apple is indirect and unclear.  Considering the lack of a direct, significant impact on Apple from this news and the general market volatility, the probability of a significant price movement (rise or fall) is considered low. We favor a slightly higher probability of no change or a minor price increase due to the overall resolution and avoidance of any protracted negative impact, but this effect is likely minimal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in response to Mark Zuckerberg's critical remarks about Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Cramer defends Apple, the overall tone of the news is mixed, touching on broader economic concerns like interest rates and wildfires, which could indirectly affect market sentiment. The direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely neutral to slightly negative, given the criticism from a high-profile CEO like Zuckerberg. The article does not provide any fundamental financial data or significant positive catalysts for Apple, so the probability of a stock price rise is low. Conversely, the negative commentary could slightly weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a modest probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on various sectors. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the technology sector is expected to benefit from lighter regulations and increased investment in AI. Big Tech leaders, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, have contributed to Trump's inauguration campaign, indicating a positive relationship. Analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives predict a 'Goldilocks' scenario for Big Tech, expecting tech stocks to rise 25% in 2025. However, the unpredictability of Trump's policies and potential market volatility could pose risks. Overall, the positive outlook on the tech sector and Apple's strong position within it suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights the strong performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and their dominance in the technology industry, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).

Additionally, the article notes that Apple is one of the companies that pays dividends, although the yield is relatively small. Given the positive outlook for the technology industry and Apple's position within it, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a trend of slightly positive to positive outlooks for Apple's stock, with probabilities ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise. Taking into account the overall positive sentiment and the potential for growth in the AI sector, the estimated probabilities are adjusted to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price rise.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news presents an optimistic outlook for Apple Inc. in the context of Donald Trump's second term, especially for the tech sector. The expected reduction in regulations and the potential for increased investment in AI are favorable for Apple, suggesting a conducive environment for growth. The sentiment from various analysts indicates that technology stocks, including Apple, are anticipated to benefit substantially, with expectations of a 'Goldilocks' scenario for big tech due to lighter regulations. While there is some concern about market volatility and unpredictability, the overall sentiment leans positively towards an increase in stock price. Given this analysis, I estimate a high probability for the stock price of Apple rising and a relatively low probability for it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple being among Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks, highlighting its strong financial performance, AI integration, and sustainability initiatives. These are positive signals. However, the article also mentions that other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting Apple may not be the highest-growth pick. Considering that Navellier's investment strategies and insights generally have positive impact to corresponding stocks and that lots of AI technologies are integrated into the Apple products, AAPL might be a considerable stocks for most investors. Reviewing previous predictions, there's a slightly positive sentiment overall. Therefore, I'm giving a moderate probability to the stock price rising and relatively low probability to it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the temporary disruption and subsequent resolution of the TikTok ban in the US. The initial ban's potential positive impact on Apple (reduced App Store competition) was short-lived due to Trump's intervention and TikTok's quick restoration.  The long-term implications remain unclear, and the direct impact on Apple's stock price from this event is likely minimal.  Analysis of previous predictions reveals a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  Most models lean towards a slight probability of a price rise, primarily due to the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the resolution of the immediate TikTok threat. However, the lack of a direct, substantial impact on Apple argues against a significant price movement in either direction.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price change is low. The slight positive bias comes from the avoidance of any protracted negative impact from the initial TikTok shutdown and some optimism around the tech sector generally.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
