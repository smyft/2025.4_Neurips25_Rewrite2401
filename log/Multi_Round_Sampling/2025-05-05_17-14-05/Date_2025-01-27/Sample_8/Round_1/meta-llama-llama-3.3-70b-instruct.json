(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and Meta Surge While AI Giants Crumble--Is the AI Boom Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by rising iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan and investor optimism about more efficient on-device AI. The company's strong position in response to the overall market's AI sell-off indicates resilience. However, it is also important to consider that the stock is still 12% off recent highs and facing potential downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales. Given these mixed signals, the probability of stock price increase is higher due to immediate positive feedback from the recent news, while downside risks still exist.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article is a summary of a Zacks Market Edge podcast episode discussing five stocks, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple is mentioned alongside other companies, the article highlights a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Although it notes that Apple's P/E of 30.1 might still be considered high considering the recent stock dip, the unfavorable Zacks rank and negative recent performance suggest a slightly higher probability of a further price decrease in the short term. However, the concluding comment that Apple potentially provides a buying opportunity should it decline further mitigates the negative sentiment. The overall sentiment is mixed, leaning slightly negative due to the zacks rating and recent poor performance. Therefore, an immediate strong downward movement is not anticipated, but a slight downward trend is more probable based on the provided information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth (8.3% earnings, 3.7% revenue), which is weaker than previous quarters.  While Apple's track record shows positive earnings surprises (average 5.05%), the negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher likelihood of disappointing the market.  Furthermore, the recent underperformance (-4.6% over three months), the weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and Jefferies' downgrade to underperform all point to a bearish outlook. While the introduction of AI features is positive, the limited current impact suggests this won't fully offset the other negative factors in the short term. The news article focuses on the broader 'Magnificent Seven' and doesn't provide any specific bullish news for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively affect investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and earnings reports often lead to volatility. Given the current negative sentiment in the tech sector, there may be heightened risk of a negative reaction. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, but its direct impact on Apple is less clear. Considering the immediate negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and highlights concerns from an analyst about AI being a strong driver for Apple's stock price. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple to reach the next level, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, such as an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to the negative outlook. The article also mentions competition in the AI space from cheaper Chinese models like DeepSeek-R1, which could potentially challenge American AI companies. Based on this analysis, the news seems to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's stock price has surged due to the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, which could lead to better on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but there is still some uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
