(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by rising iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan and investor optimism about more efficient on-device AI. The company's strong position in response to the overall market's AI sell-off indicates resilience. However, it is also important to consider that the stock is still 12% off recent highs and facing potential downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales. Given these mixed signals, the probability of stock price increase is higher due to immediate positive feedback from the recent news, while downside risks still exist.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article is a summary of a Zacks Market Edge podcast episode discussing five stocks, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple is mentioned alongside other companies, the article highlights a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Although it notes that Apple's P/E of 30.1 might still be considered high considering the recent stock dip, the unfavorable Zacks rank and negative recent performance suggest a slightly higher probability of a further price decrease in the short term. However, the concluding comment that Apple potentially provides a buying opportunity should it decline further mitigates the negative sentiment. The overall sentiment is mixed, leaning slightly negative due to the zacks rating and recent poor performance. Therefore, an immediate strong downward movement is not anticipated, but a slight downward trend is more probable based on the provided information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth (8.3% earnings, 3.7% revenue), which is weaker than previous quarters.  While Apple's track record shows positive earnings surprises (average 5.05%), the negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher likelihood of disappointing the market.  Furthermore, the recent underperformance (-4.6% over three months), the weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and Jefferies' downgrade to underperform all point to a bearish outlook. While the introduction of AI features is positive, the limited current impact suggests this won't fully offset the other negative factors in the short term. The news article focuses on the broader 'Magnificent Seven' and doesn't provide any specific bullish news for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively affect investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and earnings reports often lead to volatility. Given the current negative sentiment in the tech sector, there may be heightened risk of a negative reaction. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, but its direct impact on Apple is less clear. Considering the immediate negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and highlights concerns from an analyst about AI being a strong driver for Apple's stock price. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple to reach the next level, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, such as an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to the negative outlook. The article also mentions competition in the AI space from cheaper Chinese models like DeepSeek-R1, which could potentially challenge American AI companies. Based on this analysis, the news seems to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's stock price has surged due to the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, which could lead to better on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but there is still some uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant rise in Apple's stock, driven by positive sentiment following JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and the introduction of an efficient AI model by DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's on-device AI capabilities. Despite being 12% off recent highs and facing some analyst downgrades, the immediate market reaction to the AI news and increased iPhone orders suggests a strong bullish sentiment for Apple. However, underlying concerns regarding iPhone sales and broader tech sector volatility due to AI competition indicate risks that could lead to a downward movement. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price rising appears higher than that of falling, but caution is warranted due to the noted risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is a 'Magnificent 7' stock and part of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, it has declined 11.3% year-to-date. The stock trades at a high forward P/E of 30.1, and it has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests that analysts don't have a very positive near-term outlook. However, the article also raises the question of whether further declines would represent a buying opportunity. The overall sentiment is cautiously negative in the short term, implying a slightly higher probability of a price decrease. Considering that in previous rounds, most models also indicated a higher chance of price falling, with some recent models fluctuating. I will stick to the overall sentiment and consider the trend of the previous predictions to adjust the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news piece provides a mixed outlook for Apple. While it's included in the 'Magnificent Seven,'  a group of high-growth tech stocks, the specific details regarding Apple are less positive.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), modest projected earnings and revenue growth (8.3% and 3.7% respectively), weak sales guidance, and a recent downgrade by Jefferies all point towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. While Apple's strong track record of earnings surprises and the potential for future AI integration are positive factors, they are currently overshadowed by the immediate negative indicators.  The consensus among previous predictions leans bearish, further reinforcing this assessment.  However, the probability isn't overwhelmingly negative because Apple remains a significant player in a growth sector and positive surprises are possible. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the potential for upside.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions suggests a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The tech sector is experiencing a downturn due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively impact Apple. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, which often leads to volatility, and the current negative sentiment in the tech sector increases the risk of a negative reaction. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds another layer of uncertainty, though its direct impact on Apple is less clear. Previous predictions from various models lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. While there are some positive factors, such as potential AI advancements and iPhone demand, the overall sentiment and immediate market conditions suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses an analyst's skepticism about AI being a strong driver for Apple's stock price. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses concerns that AI may not be a catalyst for Apple to reach the next level, given the company's fully valued status and need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, such as an 8% decline in revenue in China and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to the negative outlook. The article also mentions competition in the AI space from cheaper Chinese models like DeepSeek-R1, which could potentially challenge American AI companies. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's recent surge in stock price due to the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, which could lead to better on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market's reaction to the AI news, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. The recent predictions from other models show a range of opinions, from a high probability of rising to a high probability of falling, indicating uncertainty and the need to consider multiple factors. Given the immediate positive feedback from the recent news and the potential for better on-device AI, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price. However, the company remains resilient and there are positive signals like JPMorgan raising iPhone build estimates.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. due to the recent surge in stock driven by positive sentiment from JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and advancements in AI technology, which could benefit on-device AI capabilities for Apple's products. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off recent highs, facing some analyst downgrades, and the broader tech sector is experiencing volatility due to concerns raised by a new AI model from DeepSeek. Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with many leaning towards a bearish outlook because of external pressures and concerns regarding iPhone sales. Taking these factors into account, the probability of a stock price increase is moderate, while the probability of a decline remains relatively high due to the overall market sentiment and uncertainty heading into the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed signal for Apple (AAPL). The stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date, trades at a relatively high forward P/E of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests some bearish sentiment. However, the article also poses the question of whether a further decline could represent a buying opportunity. The Zacks Market Edge podcast mentioning Apple among other stocks provides limited specific bullish information. Considering previous predictions leaning slightly towards a price fall (though with some fluctuations), and factoring in the continued negative year-to-date performance, I will assign a higher probability to a price decrease. However, given Apple's potential value as a 'Magnificent 7' stock, the fall probability is capped to avoid being overly bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While included in the 'Magnificent Seven', a group of high-growth tech stocks, the specific details regarding Apple are somewhat negative.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), modest projected earnings and revenue growth (8.3% and 3.7% respectively), weak sales guidance, and a recent downgrade by Jefferies all point towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  However, Apple's strong track record of earnings surprises and the potential for future AI integration are mitigating factors.  The previous predictions are quite diverse, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the overall trend leaning slightly bearish, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant potential for upside given Apple's market position and history. The modest projected growth and negative analyst sentiment outweigh the potential benefits of AI integration in the immediate future.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The tech sector is experiencing a downturn due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively impact Apple. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, which often leads to volatility, and the current negative sentiment in the tech sector increases the risk of a negative reaction. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds another layer of uncertainty, though its direct impact on Apple is less clear.

However, other models have provided mixed signals, with some indicating a potential for stock price rise due to positive sentiment following JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and the introduction of an efficient AI model by DeepSeek. Balancing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by DeepSeek and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25 are positive signals. On the other hand, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. The tech sector's downturn and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's policy meeting add to the bearish sentiment. However, considering the immediate positive feedback from the recent news and the potential for better on-device AI, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth.

While the inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' and JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates are positive, several factors point towards a potential fall.  Apple's modest projected growth (8.3% earnings, 3.7% revenue), a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), weak sales guidance, and a recent downgrade from Jefferies all suggest a bearish outlook.  The limited current impact of AI features and competition in the AI space add further pressure.  While Apple's historical earnings surprise track record is positive, the current indicators outweigh this positive factor in the short term. The consensus from previous predictions is also largely bearish, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price decrease.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the potential for upside given Apple's strong brand and market position, but prioritizing the immediate negative signals.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```\n"
