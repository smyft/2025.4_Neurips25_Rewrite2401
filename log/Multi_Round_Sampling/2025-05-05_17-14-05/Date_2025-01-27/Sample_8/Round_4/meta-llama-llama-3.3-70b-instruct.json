      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and Meta Surge While AI Giants Crumble--Is the AI Boom Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by rising iPhone build estimates from JPMorgan and investor optimism about more efficient on-device AI. The company's strong position in response to the overall market's AI sell-off indicates resilience. However, it is also important to consider that the stock is still 12% off recent highs and facing potential downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales. Given these mixed signals, the probability of stock price increase is higher due to immediate positive feedback from the recent news, while downside risks still exist.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article is a summary of a Zacks Market Edge podcast episode discussing five stocks, including Apple (AAPL). While Apple is mentioned alongside other companies, the article highlights a year-to-date decline of 11.3% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Although it notes that Apple's P/E of 30.1 might still be considered high considering the recent stock dip, the unfavorable Zacks rank and negative recent performance suggest a slightly higher probability of a further price decrease in the short term. However, the concluding comment that Apple potentially provides a buying opportunity should it decline further mitigates the negative sentiment. The overall sentiment is mixed, leaning slightly negative due to the zacks rating and recent poor performance. Therefore, an immediate strong downward movement is not anticipated, but a slight downward trend is more probable based on the provided information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth (8.3% earnings, 3.7% revenue), which is weaker than previous quarters.  While Apple's track record shows positive earnings surprises (average 5.05%), the negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest a higher likelihood of disappointing the market.  Furthermore, the recent underperformance (-4.6% over three months), the weak sales guidance ('low to mid-single digit' growth), and Jefferies' downgrade to underperform all point to a bearish outlook. While the introduction of AI features is positive, the limited current impact suggests this won't fully offset the other negative factors in the short term. The news article focuses on the broader 'Magnificent Seven' and doesn't provide any specific bullish news for Apple.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could impact Apple Inc.'s stock price: 1) The tech sector is tumbling due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively affect investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple. 2) Apple is set to report earnings this week, and earnings reports often lead to volatility. Given the current negative sentiment in the tech sector, there may be heightened risk of a negative reaction. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting could influence broader market trends, but its direct impact on Apple is less clear. Considering the immediate negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around earnings, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current position in the AI landscape and highlights concerns from an analyst about AI being a strong driver for Apple's stock price. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple to reach the next level, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, such as an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to the negative outlook. The article also mentions competition in the AI space from cheaper Chinese models like DeepSeek-R1, which could potentially challenge American AI companies. Based on this analysis, the news seems to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price prospects.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates that Apple's stock price has surged due to the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, which could lead to better on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but there is still some uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant rise in Apple's stock, driven by positive sentiment following JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and the introduction of an efficient AI model by DeepSeek, which could enhance Apple's on-device AI capabilities. Despite being 12% off recent highs and facing some analyst downgrades, the immediate market reaction to the AI news and increased iPhone orders suggests a strong bullish sentiment for Apple. However, underlying concerns regarding iPhone sales and broader tech sector volatility due to AI competition indicate risks that could lead to a downward movement. Balancing these factors, the probability of the stock price rising appears higher than that of falling, but caution is warranted due to the noted risks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple is a 'Magnificent 7' stock and part of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, it has declined 11.3% year-to-date. The stock trades at a high forward P/E of 30.1, and it has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests that analysts don't have a very positive near-term outlook. However, the article also raises the question of whether further declines would represent a buying opportunity. The overall sentiment is cautiously negative in the short term, implying a slightly higher probability of a price decrease. Considering that in previous rounds, most models also indicated a higher chance of price falling, with some recent models fluctuating. I will stick to the overall sentiment and consider the trend of the previous predictions to adjust the probabilities accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news piece provides a mixed outlook for Apple. While it's included in the 'Magnificent Seven,'  a group of high-growth tech stocks, the specific details regarding Apple are less positive.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), modest projected earnings and revenue growth (8.3% and 3.7% respectively), weak sales guidance, and a recent downgrade by Jefferies all point towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term. While Apple's strong track record of earnings surprises and the potential for future AI integration are positive factors, they are currently overshadowed by the immediate negative indicators.  The consensus among previous predictions leans bearish, further reinforcing this assessment.  However, the probability isn't overwhelmingly negative because Apple remains a significant player in a growth sector and positive surprises are possible. Therefore, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the potential for upside.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions suggests a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The tech sector is experiencing a downturn due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively impact Apple. Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, which often leads to volatility, and the current negative sentiment in the tech sector increases the risk of a negative reaction. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds another layer of uncertainty, though its direct impact on Apple is less clear. Previous predictions from various models lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. While there are some positive factors, such as potential AI advancements and iPhone demand, the overall sentiment and immediate market conditions suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses an analyst's skepticism about AI being a strong driver for Apple's stock price. The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses concerns that AI may not be a catalyst for Apple to reach the next level, given the company's fully valued status and need for new catalysts.

The article also mentions competition in the AI space from cheaper Chinese models like DeepSeek-R1, which could potentially challenge American AI companies. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's recent surge in stock price due to the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, which could lead to better on-device AI for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan has raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. However, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market's reaction to the AI news, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. The recent predictions from other models show a range of opinions, from a high probability of rising to a high probability of falling, indicating uncertainty and the need to consider multiple factors. Given the immediate positive feedback from the recent news and the potential for better on-device AI, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth. The analyst argues that current trends and developments in AI, such as DeepSeek-R1, pose competitive challenges. Additionally, Apple faces issues in critical markets like China and in product segments such as Wearables and Vision Pro, suggesting current growth drivers are weak. These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price. However, the company remains resilient and there are positive signals like JPMorgan raising iPhone build estimates.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. due to the recent surge in stock driven by positive sentiment from JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and advancements in AI technology, which could benefit on-device AI capabilities for Apple's products. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off recent highs, facing some analyst downgrades, and the broader tech sector is experiencing volatility due to concerns raised by a new AI model from DeepSeek. Previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with many leaning towards a bearish outlook because of external pressures and concerns regarding iPhone sales. Taking these factors into account, the probability of a stock price increase is moderate, while the probability of a decline remains relatively high due to the overall market sentiment and uncertainty heading into the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article provides a mixed signal for Apple (AAPL). The stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date, trades at a relatively high forward P/E of 30.1, and has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). This suggests some bearish sentiment. However, the article also poses the question of whether a further decline could represent a buying opportunity. The Zacks Market Edge podcast mentioning Apple among other stocks provides limited specific bullish information. Considering previous predictions leaning slightly towards a price fall (though with some fluctuations), and factoring in the continued negative year-to-date performance, I will assign a higher probability to a price decrease. However, given Apple's potential value as a 'Magnificent 7' stock, the fall probability is capped to avoid being overly bearish.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While included in the 'Magnificent Seven', a group of high-growth tech stocks, the specific details regarding Apple are somewhat negative.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), modest projected earnings and revenue growth (8.3% and 3.7% respectively), weak sales guidance, and a recent downgrade by Jefferies all point towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  However, Apple's strong track record of earnings surprises and the potential for future AI integration are mitigating factors.  The previous predictions are quite diverse, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 for the probability of a price rise. Considering the mixed signals and the overall trend leaning slightly bearish, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the significant potential for upside given Apple's market position and history. The modest projected growth and negative analyst sentiment outweigh the potential benefits of AI integration in the immediate future.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed but slightly negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The tech sector is experiencing a downturn due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively impact Apple.

The article also mentions competition in the AI space from cheaper Chinese models like DeepSeek-R1, which could potentially challenge American AI companies. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising. However, other models have provided mixed signals, with some indicating a potential for stock price rise due to positive sentiment following JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and the introduction of an efficient AI model by DeepSeek. Balancing these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the unveiling of a cost-effective AI model by DeepSeek and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates for 1H25 are positive signals. On the other hand, the stock is still 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some analysts. The tech sector's downturn and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's policy meeting add to the bearish sentiment. However, considering the immediate positive feedback from the recent news and the potential for better on-device AI, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights skepticism around AI as a key driver for Apple's future growth.

These factors cumulatively imply a bearish sentiment which may pressure the stock price. However, the company remains resilient and there are positive signals like JPMorgan raising iPhone build estimates.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. The positive rise in stock price due to JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and potential for improved on-device AI from recent AI advancements are beneficial. However, the stock remains 12% off its recent highs, and there are ongoing concerns about iPhone sales and negative analyst downgrades. Broader market pressures from the AI sector also weigh heavily on investor sentiment. While there are both bullish and bearish signals, overall market sentiment leans slightly negative, suggesting that the probability of a stock price fall is marginally higher than that of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights both positive and negative aspects of Apple (AAPL). On the negative side, the stock has declined 11.3% year-to-date and carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating analysts' unfavorable near-term outlook. Additionally, the high P/E ratio might suggest overvaluation. The Zacks Market Edge podcast mentions Apple, but offers no immediate specific positive signals beyond a question on buying opportunities if the stock falls further. On the positive side, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7', part of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, and a potential AI advancement. \n\nReviewing past predictions, there's a clear shift in sentiment back toward a more bearish outlook. Initial reactions to supposed good news were dampened, with models increasingly focusing on fundamental weaknesses and negative analyst ratings. The average probabilities across the last round leaned towards a higher likelihood of a price fall.\n\nGiven these factors and the slightly bearish trend, a higher probability is assigned to the stock price falling. However, the potential value of Apple, its position in the 'Magnificent 7' and the brand recognition temper the probability; meaning there's also a significant chance the price might rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the inclusion in the 'Magnificent Seven' and JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates are positive, several factors point towards a potential fall.  Apple's modest projected growth (8.3% earnings, 3.7% revenue), a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), weak sales guidance, and a recent downgrade from Jefferies all suggest a bearish outlook.  The limited current impact of AI features and competition in the AI space add further pressure.  While Apple's historical earnings surprise track record is positive, the current indicators outweigh this positive factor in the short term. The consensus from previous predictions is also largely bearish, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price decrease.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the potential for upside given Apple's strong brand and market position, but prioritizing the immediate negative signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a tumbling tech sector due to concerns over DeepSeek AI's new model, which could negatively impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). Additionally, Apple is set to report earnings this week, which could lead to volatility, especially given the current negative sentiment in the tech sector. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds another layer of uncertainty, though its direct impact on Apple is less clear.
