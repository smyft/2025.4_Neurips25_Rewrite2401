(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant investments in AI and its positioning within the AI ecosystem, which is likely to create positive sentiment among investors. Analysts from JPMorgan suggest that Apple stands to benefit from its AI initiatives, contributing to innovation and ecosystem growth. While there are concerns regarding high valuations and potential earnings disappointments, the strong fundamentals of major tech companies, including Apple, and their roles in the AI revolution suggest a favorable outlook. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive factors include: 1) The stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks amidst an AI sell-off. 2) An analyst suggests that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) could benefit Apple's iPhone AI products. 3) Even venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sees significance in DeepSeek's recent launch. 4) Analyst Buy ratings for AAPL give a target of $246. Negative factors include: 1) The overall negative sentiment towards AI investments in the broader market could affect Apple. 2) Shares remain down 12% from last month, suggesting a weaker near-term trend. 3) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales is also not good. 4) Upcoming earnings report Jan. 30. Given the mixed factors, a slight upward momentum might be expected. Given the good stock movement that day and the analyst's comments, there is reason to believe that AI can make more favorable products for Apple. However, there is evidence to show the iPhone sales aren't great, and the overall AI market investment sentiment is currently negative. With the factors considered, the probabilities are based on the relatively good news, a slightly-better-than-even rising stock price move is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS increase and strong Services segment growth are positive, concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal.  The article highlights a stretched valuation and underperformance compared to the sector. Although the AI push is a potential long-term positive, its immediate impact is uncertain, and reported bugs are a concern.  Considering the diverse factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall, although neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals. The overall tone leans bearish due to immediate concerns outweighing potential long-term benefits.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to report strong earnings growth. However, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating lower chances of an earnings beat. Additionally, Apple's stock has underperformed the industry with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. The company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. Despite the rollout of AI applications, these features haven't boosted iPhone sales significantly. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect a local AI partner announcement soon. Given the mixed sentiment and the fact that Apple's earnings report is due on Thursday, January 30th, there's a cautious outlook but potential for positive surprise which could lead to a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports a frenzy of iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. This situation is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it highlights the strong demand for iPhones and the willingness of consumers to pay premium prices for devices with the TikTok app installed. However, the impact of the ban on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited, as the ban is uncertain and may be resolved in the near future. Additionally, the article does not mention any significant impact on Apple's financials or operations. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance. However, the downward revision of earnings estimates by 1.1% in the last 30 days and the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating) suggest concerns. Additionally, a negative recent stock performance (-12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%) and the variety of mixed product and geographic revenue projections provide conflicting signals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued commitment to AI investments, which positions it favorably in the evolving tech landscape. The insights from JPMorgan suggest that while market valuations may involve uncertainties, Apple's diversification and strong fundamentals provide a counterbalance to those concerns. The mention of potential revenue growth from AI innovations reinforces a positive outlook, although there are warnings about the sustainability of current valuations. Given that the broader market has mixed sentiments towards AI investments but also recognizes Apple's potential, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price increase despite recent performance struggles.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights both positive and negative aspects for Apple. Positives include AAPL and META bucking the trend in the 'Magnificent 7' amid an AI selloff, indicating relative strength. An analyst suggests DeepSeek's efficient models will benefit Apple's iPhone AI. Zuckerberg's massive AI spending could also benefit Apple in the long run, and that DeepSeek's is impressive. Negatives include AAPL's shares being down 12% from last month, struggling iPhone sales as reiterated from recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, with AI smartphones still not gaining much traction. Finally, the upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty. The previous round of model responses exhibit mixed sentiments and fluctuating probabilities. Taking into consideration the fact that AAPL bucked the market trend that day and AI is a positive catalyst mentioned and the model predictions tend to range from 0.3 to 0.7 for stock price rise, I'll put a slightly more emphasis on the positive aspects and put the rising probablity around 0.6.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include expected EPS and revenue growth, a strong Services segment showing double-digit growth, and increasing Mac sales.  The AI push with Apple Intelligence is a potential long-term positive, though its immediate impact is uncertain due to a delayed launch and reported bugs.  Negative factors outweigh positives however.  Concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese vendors, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal, and the article highlights a stretched valuation and underperformance compared to the sector. The overall sentiment is cautious, with several analysts expressing concern. While the AI initiative holds promise, the current challenges related to iPhone sales and the negative Zacks rating suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.  The previous predictions show a considerable spread of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's immediate future. Considering all aspects, the probability of a fall is greater than that of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to report strong earnings growth (20.9% year-over-year). However, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which suggests lower chances of an earnings beat. The stock has underperformed the industry, with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. Additionally, Apple provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. The rollout of AI applications has not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company faces challenges with its AI strategy. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies expected to report strong earnings growth, and there are expectations that the company will announce a local AI partner soon, which could boost investor confidence. However, there are concerns regarding Apple's performance in China, its AI strategy, and potential declines in iPhone sales. Additionally, the stock has underperformed lately, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems moderate, but not overwhelmingly likely.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports a frenzy of iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. This situation is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it highlights the strong demand for iPhones and the willingness of consumers to pay premium prices for devices with the TikTok app installed.

The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further adds bearish sentiment.
