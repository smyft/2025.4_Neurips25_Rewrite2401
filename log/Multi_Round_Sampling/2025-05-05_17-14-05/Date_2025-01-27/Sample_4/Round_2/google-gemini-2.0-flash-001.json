(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Meta Platforms rise to lead 'Magnificent 7' stocks amid AI washout\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) stock both jumped more than 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of their Magnificent Seven peers and providing some respite for tech investors amid a steep sell-off in AI and related names following the release of Chinese firm DeepSeek's new cost-effective AI model.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"Apple is reacting positively to the DeepSeek news because smaller more efficient models means it will be able to have better AI products in the iPhone.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said the company would spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI investments. The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) also fell.DeepSeek app on an iPhone.

Apple is set to report earnings after the bell Jan. 30. The majority of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $246 over the next 12 months.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant investments in AI and its positioning within the AI ecosystem, which is likely to create positive sentiment among investors. Analysts from JPMorgan suggest that Apple stands to benefit from its AI initiatives, contributing to innovation and ecosystem growth. While there are concerns regarding high valuations and potential earnings disappointments, the strong fundamentals of major tech companies, including Apple, and their roles in the AI revolution suggest a favorable outlook. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive factors include: 1) The stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks amidst an AI sell-off. 2) An analyst suggests that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) could benefit Apple's iPhone AI products. 3) Even venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sees significance in DeepSeek's recent launch. 4) Analyst Buy ratings for AAPL give a target of $246. Negative factors include: 1) The overall negative sentiment towards AI investments in the broader market could affect Apple. 2) Shares remain down 12% from last month, suggesting a weaker near-term trend. 3) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales is also not good. 4) Upcoming earnings report Jan. 30. Given the mixed factors, a slight upward momentum might be expected. Given the good stock movement that day and the analyst's comments, there is reason to believe that AI can make more favorable products for Apple. However, there is evidence to show the iPhone sales aren't great, and the overall AI market investment sentiment is currently negative. With the factors considered, the probabilities are based on the relatively good news, a slightly-better-than-even rising stock price move is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS increase and strong Services segment growth are positive, concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal.  The article highlights a stretched valuation and underperformance compared to the sector. Although the AI push is a potential long-term positive, its immediate impact is uncertain, and reported bugs are a concern.  Considering the diverse factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall, although neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals. The overall tone leans bearish due to immediate concerns outweighing potential long-term benefits.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to report strong earnings growth. However, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating lower chances of an earnings beat. Additionally, Apple's stock has underperformed the industry with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. The company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. Despite the rollout of AI applications, these features haven't boosted iPhone sales significantly. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect a local AI partner announcement soon. Given the mixed sentiment and the fact that Apple's earnings report is due on Thursday, January 30th, there's a cautious outlook but potential for positive surprise which could lead to a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports a frenzy of iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. This situation is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it highlights the strong demand for iPhones and the willingness of consumers to pay premium prices for devices with the TikTok app installed. However, the impact of the ban on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited, as the ban is uncertain and may be resolved in the near future. Additionally, the article does not mention any significant impact on Apple's financials or operations. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance. However, the downward revision of earnings estimates by 1.1% in the last 30 days and the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating) suggest concerns. Additionally, a negative recent stock performance (-12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%) and the variety of mixed product and geographic revenue projections provide conflicting signals.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's continued commitment to AI investments, which positions it favorably in the evolving tech landscape. The insights from JPMorgan suggest that while market valuations may involve uncertainties, Apple's diversification and strong fundamentals provide a counterbalance to those concerns. The mention of potential revenue growth from AI innovations reinforces a positive outlook, although there are warnings about the sustainability of current valuations. Given that the broader market has mixed sentiments towards AI investments but also recognizes Apple's potential, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stock price increase despite recent performance struggles.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights both positive and negative aspects for Apple. Positives include AAPL and META bucking the trend in the 'Magnificent 7' amid an AI selloff, indicating relative strength. An analyst suggests DeepSeek's efficient models will benefit Apple's iPhone AI. Zuckerberg's massive AI spending could also benefit Apple in the long run, and that DeepSeek's is impressive. Negatives include AAPL's shares being down 12% from last month, struggling iPhone sales as reiterated from recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital, with AI smartphones still not gaining much traction. Finally, the upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty. The previous round of model responses exhibit mixed sentiments and fluctuating probabilities. Taking into consideration the fact that AAPL bucked the market trend that day and AI is a positive catalyst mentioned and the model predictions tend to range from 0.3 to 0.7 for stock price rise, I'll put a slightly more emphasis on the positive aspects and put the rising probablity around 0.6.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include expected EPS and revenue growth, a strong Services segment showing double-digit growth, and increasing Mac sales.  The AI push with Apple Intelligence is a potential long-term positive, though its immediate impact is uncertain due to a delayed launch and reported bugs.  Negative factors outweigh positives however.  Concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese vendors, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal, and the article highlights a stretched valuation and underperformance compared to the sector. The overall sentiment is cautious, with several analysts expressing concern. While the AI initiative holds promise, the current challenges related to iPhone sales and the negative Zacks rating suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term.  The previous predictions show a considerable spread of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's immediate future. Considering all aspects, the probability of a fall is greater than that of a rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to report strong earnings growth (20.9% year-over-year). However, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which suggests lower chances of an earnings beat. The stock has underperformed the industry, with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. Additionally, Apple provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. The rollout of AI applications has not significantly boosted iPhone sales, and the company faces challenges with its AI strategy. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies expected to report strong earnings growth, and there are expectations that the company will announce a local AI partner soon, which could boost investor confidence. However, there are concerns regarding Apple's performance in China, its AI strategy, and potential declines in iPhone sales. Additionally, the stock has underperformed lately, and estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems moderate, but not overwhelmingly likely.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports a frenzy of iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. This situation is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it highlights the strong demand for iPhones and the willingness of consumers to pay premium prices for devices with the TikTok app installed. However, the impact of the ban on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited, as the ban is uncertain and may be resolved in the near future. Additionally, the article does not mention any significant impact on Apple's financials or operations. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance.

The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further adds bearish sentiment. Given the mixed outlook and historical performance, there is a higher likelihood of the stock facing downward pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
