(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\nNews Content: TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant investments in AI and its positioning within the AI ecosystem, which is likely to create positive sentiment among investors. Analysts from JPMorgan suggest that Apple stands to benefit from its AI initiatives, contributing to innovation and ecosystem growth. While there are concerns regarding high valuations and potential earnings disappointments, the strong fundamentals of major tech companies, including Apple, and their roles in the AI revolution suggest a favorable outlook. Given these factors, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). Positive factors include: 1) The stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks amidst an AI sell-off. 2) An analyst suggests that smaller, more efficient AI models (like DeepSeek's) could benefit Apple's iPhone AI products. 3) Even venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sees significance in DeepSeek's recent launch. 4) Analyst Buy ratings for AAPL give a target of $246. Negative factors include: 1) The overall negative sentiment towards AI investments in the broader market could affect Apple. 2) Shares remain down 12% from last month, suggesting a weaker near-term trend. 3) Recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales is also not good. 4) Upcoming earnings report Jan. 30. Given the mixed factors, a slight upward momentum might be expected. Given the good stock movement that day and the analyst's comments, there is reason to believe that AI can make more favorable products for Apple. However, there is evidence to show the iPhone sales aren't great, and the overall AI market investment sentiment is currently negative. With the factors considered, the probabilities are based on the relatively good news, a slightly-better-than-even rising stock price move is predicted.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS increase and strong Services segment growth are positive, concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal.  The article highlights a stretched valuation and underperformance compared to the sector. Although the AI push is a potential long-term positive, its immediate impact is uncertain, and reported bugs are a concern.  Considering the diverse factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall, although neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals. The overall tone leans bearish due to immediate concerns outweighing potential long-term benefits.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is part of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, which are expected to report strong earnings growth. However, Apple has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating lower chances of an earnings beat. Additionally, Apple's stock has underperformed the industry with a 4.6% decline over the past three months. The company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter, expecting 'low to mid-single digit' sales growth. Despite the rollout of AI applications, these features haven't boosted iPhone sales significantly. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of Zacks Earnings Preview, along with other major companies. The content highlights that Apple's shares have struggled lately, lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market, due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Despite stable estimates for the December quarter, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. However, Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and expect a local AI partner announcement soon. Given the mixed sentiment and the fact that Apple's earnings report is due on Thursday, January 30th, there's a cautious outlook but potential for positive surprise which could lead to a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article reports a frenzy of iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the recent TikTok ban in the U.S. This situation is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price, as it highlights the strong demand for iPhones and the willingness of consumers to pay premium prices for devices with the TikTok app installed. However, the impact of the ban on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited, as the ban is uncertain and may be resolved in the near future. Additionally, the article does not mention any significant impact on Apple's financials or operations. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the expected earnings growth (8.3%) and revenue growth (3.7%) suggest positive performance. However, the downward revision of earnings estimates by 1.1% in the last 30 days and the current Zacks Rank #4 (indicating a sell rating) suggest concerns. Additionally, a negative recent stock performance (-12.8% over the past month compared to the S&P 500's +1.1%) and the variety of mixed product and geographic revenue projections provide conflicting signals.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
