(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and Meta Surge While AI Giants Crumble--Is the AI Boom Cracking?\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has triggered a significant sell-off in the tech sector, including major companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. While Apple is reported to be less affected compared to its peers, the overall market sentiment is negative due to fears of increased competition in the AI landscape from lower-cost, effective alternatives. Analysts have expressed concerns that if costs for AI model training can be substantially reduced, it could lead to lower valuations across the sector, increasing pressure on stocks like Apple, even if indirectly. Given the considerable market volatility following the news and the probabilities of further corrections, we can estimate a higher chance of falling prices for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI. The emergence of a potentially cost-effective competitor from China (Deepseek) creates significant uncertainty and could undermine the valuations of companies heavily invested in AI hardware and software. While some analysts suggest this could be an overreaction or even beneficial for some 'hyperscalers' in the long run, the immediate market response is strongly negative. Apple rose 2.6pc in premarket, likely due to an increase stock to bonds with the rise in demand for safe haven currencies; as well as Apple being the least affected from the Deepseek news. Given the information provided, the fall of Apple stock prices at the end of the week is the more likely situation, with the assumption that Apple stock rose at it did due to the market sell-off to seek stable ground.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that rivals US competitors at a significantly lower cost. This poses a threat to the dominance of US tech companies, including Apple, particularly in the AI sector.  While Apple's direct involvement in AI development is less emphasized in this news compared to companies like Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to DeepSeek's success, combined with reduced investment in AI hardware, creates a negative spillover effect. The market's overreaction, as suggested by some analysts, is also plausible. However, given the broader market downturn impacting the tech sector, and Apple's significant reliance on consumer demand and its broader ecosystem rather than solely AI, the probability of a price increase is low.  Apple's current success and established market position might provide some resilience against the overall market downturn, but the fear and uncertainty generated by the news will likely outweigh any positive factors in the short-term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news indicates mixed signals. On the negative side, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting a lower likelihood of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Additionally, weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform due to limited AI feature adoption in non-English markets add to the bearish sentiment. On the positive side, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, with an average surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The consensus estimate indicates modest year-over-year earnings growth of 8.3% and revenue growth of 3.7%. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment strategy and his confidence in various stocks, particularly highlighting that he has been a buyer of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 24 of the last 25 quarters. This indicates his high confidence in his own company. However, the article also mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding and has a strong capital-return program. Despite the positive remarks about Apple, the article's focus on Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway stock rather than Apple might slightly overshadow Apple's prospects. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment about Apple remains positive due to its market share leadership and shareholder return program.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan's report, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI developers, and AI integrators. The report highlights the potential for AI to drive revenue growth and user retention within Apple's ecosystem. However, it also notes that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market may be unsustainable, and that a catch-down scenario is possible if the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and its position as a leader in the AI space, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off across the tech sector, raising concerns about competition and cost efficiencies that could undermine the valuations of major players like Apple. Despite Apple experiencing less direct impact compared to other companies, the overall sentiment in the market remains negative. Previous predictions consistently indicate a higher likelihood of falling prices for Apple, reflecting the pervasive uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding the sector. Thus, while Apple has shown some resilience, the overwhelming market conditions suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot has created a significant negative market reaction, particularly impacting AI-related stocks. While Apple's direct exposure to the AI hardware market is less than companies like Nvidia, the overall negative sentiment and broad tech sell-off significantly influence AAPL's price.  The initial pre-market rise in Apple's stock price could be attributed to a flight to safety as investors move from riskier assets into more stable ones like Apple, the least impacted by the emerging market disruption.. However, the sustained negative sentiment and the potential for a broader market correction due to the DeepSeek development suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decrease. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, leaning towards a price decrease, which further supports my conclusion. The uncertainty surrounding the long-term implications of DeepSeek\u2019s success adds to the risk of further market volatility and hence short term decrease in price.  However, Apple\u2019s strong fundamentals and established market position could provide some cushioning against a drastic price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season focus on the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of an earnings beat.

However, the overall sentiment about Apple remains positive due to its market share leadership and shareholder return program. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions from various models, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation.

(AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown resilience against the AI sell-off and received positive developments such as JPMorgan raising its iPhone build estimates and potential benefits from more efficient AI models like those developed by DeepSeek. These factors suggest a positive outlook. On the other hand, there are concerns related to iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and overall market sentiment driven by competition, especially from Chinese AI upstarts. Despite some positive predictions, the mixed signals and existing market sentiments suggest cautious optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
