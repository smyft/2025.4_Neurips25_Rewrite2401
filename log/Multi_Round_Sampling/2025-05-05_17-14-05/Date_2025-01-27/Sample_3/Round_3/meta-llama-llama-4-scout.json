(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters\nNews Content: When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.\n\nBuffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, he lays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Street and keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.\n\nBut when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple, AmEx, and Bank of America are large holdings -- but none are Buffett's favorite stock\n\nLogic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nTech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nHowever, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. \"AmEx,\" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an \"indefinite\" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.\n\nYet it's been a long time since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.\n\nBut since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased this stock in 24 out of the last 25 quarters\n\nInterestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.\n\nRather, detailed purchasing activity of this \"favorite stock\" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in is shares of his own company.\n\nHowever, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.\n\nEven though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.\n\nAside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.\n\nFor one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.\n\nThe other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has triggered a significant sell-off in the tech sector, including major companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. While Apple is reported to be less affected compared to its peers, the overall market sentiment is negative due to fears of increased competition in the AI landscape from lower-cost, effective alternatives. Analysts have expressed concerns that if costs for AI model training can be substantially reduced, it could lead to lower valuations across the sector, increasing pressure on stocks like Apple, even if indirectly. Given the considerable market volatility following the news and the probabilities of further corrections, we can estimate a higher chance of falling prices for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI. The emergence of a potentially cost-effective competitor from China (Deepseek) creates significant uncertainty and could undermine the valuations of companies heavily invested in AI hardware and software. While some analysts suggest this could be an overreaction or even beneficial for some 'hyperscalers' in the long run, the immediate market response is strongly negative. Apple rose 2.6pc in premarket, likely due to an increase stock to bonds with the rise in demand for safe haven currencies; as well as Apple being the least affected from the Deepseek news. Given the information provided, the fall of Apple stock prices at the end of the week is the more likely situation, with the assumption that Apple stock rose at it did due to the market sell-off to seek stable ground.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that rivals US competitors at a significantly lower cost. This poses a threat to the dominance of US tech companies, including Apple, particularly in the AI sector.  While Apple's direct involvement in AI development is less emphasized in this news compared to companies like Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to DeepSeek's success, combined with reduced investment in AI hardware, creates a negative spillover effect. The market's overreaction, as suggested by some analysts, is also plausible. However, given the broader market downturn impacting the tech sector, and Apple's significant reliance on consumer demand and its broader ecosystem rather than solely AI, the probability of a price increase is low.  Apple's current success and established market position might provide some resilience against the overall market downturn, but the fear and uncertainty generated by the news will likely outweigh any positive factors in the short-term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news indicates mixed signals. On the negative side, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting a lower likelihood of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Additionally, weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform due to limited AI feature adoption in non-English markets add to the bearish sentiment. On the positive side, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, with an average surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The consensus estimate indicates modest year-over-year earnings growth of 8.3% and revenue growth of 3.7%. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment strategy and his confidence in various stocks, particularly highlighting that he has been a buyer of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 24 of the last 25 quarters. This indicates his high confidence in his own company. However, the article also mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding and has a strong capital-return program. Despite the positive remarks about Apple, the article's focus on Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway stock rather than Apple might slightly overshadow Apple's prospects. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment about Apple remains positive due to its market share leadership and shareholder return program.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan's report, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI developers, and AI integrators. The report highlights the potential for AI to drive revenue growth and user retention within Apple's ecosystem. However, it also notes that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market may be unsustainable, and that a catch-down scenario is possible if the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and its position as a leader in the AI space, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off across the tech sector, raising concerns about competition and cost efficiencies that could undermine the valuations of major players like Apple. Despite Apple experiencing less direct impact compared to other companies, the overall sentiment in the market remains negative. Previous predictions consistently indicate a higher likelihood of falling prices for Apple, reflecting the pervasive uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding the sector. Thus, while Apple has shown some resilience, the overwhelming market conditions suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot has created a significant negative market reaction, particularly impacting AI-related stocks. While Apple's direct exposure to the AI hardware market is less than companies like Nvidia, the overall negative sentiment and broad tech sell-off significantly influence AAPL's price.  The initial pre-market rise in Apple's stock price could be attributed to a flight to safety as investors move from riskier assets into more stable ones like Apple, the least impacted by the emerging market disruption.. However, the sustained negative sentiment and the potential for a broader market correction due to the DeepSeek development suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decrease. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, leaning towards a price decrease, which further supports my conclusion. The uncertainty surrounding the long-term implications of DeepSeek\u2019s success adds to the risk of further market volatility and hence short term decrease in price.  However, Apple\u2019s strong fundamentals and established market position could provide some cushioning against a drastic price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season focus on the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months.

(AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown resilience against the AI sell-off and received positive developments such as JPMorgan raising its iPhone build estimates and potential benefits from more efficient AI models like those developed by DeepSeek. These factors suggest a positive outlook. On the other hand, there are concerns related to iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and overall market sentiment driven by competition, especially from Chinese AI upstarts. Despite some positive predictions, the mixed signals and existing market sentiments suggest cautious optimism.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, poses a significant challenge to US tech stocks, particularly those involved in the AI sector. While Apple has been less affected due to its strong fundamentals and diversified product ecosystem, the overall market sentiment remains negative. Analysts exhibit a prevailing belief that competition from lower-cost, effective alternatives like DeepSeek will pressure valuations across the tech sector, affecting companies like Apple indirectly. Additionally, despite some positive developments in Apple's AI initiatives, the consistent predictions from various models lean towards a higher probability of a stock price decline over a short-term horizon given the current market volatility and negative sentiment. Therefore, while Apple shows resilience, the prevailing risk suggests a stronger likelihood of falling prices compared to rising ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The dominant narrative in the provided news and previous predictions is that the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI competitor, has triggered a tech sell-off due to concerns about reduced hardware demand and potential re-evaluation of AI company valuations. While some analyses highlight Apple's relative resilience and strong fundamentals, the overall sentiment remains negative. The initial bounce might be a flight to safety, but the lasting impact appears to be downwards. There are diverse price predictions across models, indicating that uncertainty remains, creating a higher chance of pricing decrease in line with market trends.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot has created a significant negative market reaction, impacting AI-related stocks and the broader tech sector.

Previous predictions, while varied, lean towards a price decrease.  The uncertainty surrounding the long-term implications of DeepSeek's success adds to the risk of further market volatility.  Apple's strong fundamentals and established market position could provide some cushioning against a drastic price fall, but the short-term outlook remains negative given the prevailing market conditions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season focus on the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple (AAPL).
