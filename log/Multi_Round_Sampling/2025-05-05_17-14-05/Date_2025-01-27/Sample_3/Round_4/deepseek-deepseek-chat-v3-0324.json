(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has triggered a significant sell-off in the tech sector, including major companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. While Apple is reported to be less affected compared to its peers, the overall market sentiment is negative due to fears of increased competition in the AI landscape from lower-cost, effective alternatives. Analysts have expressed concerns that if costs for AI model training can be substantially reduced, it could lead to lower valuations across the sector, increasing pressure on stocks like Apple, even if indirectly. Given the considerable market volatility following the news and the probabilities of further corrections, we can estimate a higher chance of falling prices for Apple in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI. The emergence of a potentially cost-effective competitor from China (Deepseek) creates significant uncertainty and could undermine the valuations of companies heavily invested in AI hardware and software. While some analysts suggest this could be an overreaction or even beneficial for some 'hyperscalers' in the long run, the immediate market response is strongly negative. Apple rose 2.6pc in premarket, likely due to an increase stock to bonds with the rise in demand for safe haven currencies; as well as Apple being the least affected from the Deepseek news. Given the information provided, the fall of Apple stock prices at the end of the week is the more likely situation, with the assumption that Apple stock rose at it did due to the market sell-off to seek stable ground.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news focuses on the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that rivals US competitors at a significantly lower cost. This poses a threat to the dominance of US tech companies, including Apple, particularly in the AI sector.  While Apple's direct involvement in AI development is less emphasized in this news compared to companies like Nvidia or Microsoft, the overall negative sentiment towards the tech sector due to DeepSeek's success, combined with reduced investment in AI hardware, creates a negative spillover effect. The market's overreaction, as suggested by some analysts, is also plausible. However, given the broader market downturn impacting the tech sector, and Apple's significant reliance on consumer demand and its broader ecosystem rather than solely AI, the probability of a price increase is low.  Apple's current success and established market position might provide some resilience against the overall market downturn, but the fear and uncertainty generated by the news will likely outweigh any positive factors in the short-term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on the provided financial news indicates mixed signals. On the negative side, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting a lower likelihood of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months. Additionally, weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and a rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform due to limited AI feature adoption in non-English markets add to the bearish sentiment. On the positive side, Apple has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises, with an average surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The consensus estimate indicates modest year-over-year earnings growth of 8.3% and revenue growth of 3.7%. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment strategy and his confidence in various stocks, particularly highlighting that he has been a buyer of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 24 of the last 25 quarters. This indicates his high confidence in his own company. However, the article also mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding and has a strong capital-return program. Despite the positive remarks about Apple, the article's focus on Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway stock rather than Apple might slightly overshadow Apple's prospects. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment about Apple remains positive due to its market share leadership and shareholder return program.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan's report, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI developers, and AI integrators. The report highlights the potential for AI to drive revenue growth and user retention within Apple's ecosystem. However, it also notes that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market may be unsustainable, and that a catch-down scenario is possible if the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies. Given Apple's strong fundamentals and its position as a leader in the AI space, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off across the tech sector, raising concerns about competition and cost efficiencies that could undermine the valuations of major players like Apple. Despite Apple experiencing less direct impact compared to other companies, the overall sentiment in the market remains negative. Previous predictions consistently indicate a higher likelihood of falling prices for Apple, reflecting the pervasive uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding the sector. Thus, while Apple has shown some resilience, the overwhelming market conditions suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot has created a significant negative market reaction, particularly impacting AI-related stocks. While Apple's direct exposure to the AI hardware market is less than companies like Nvidia, the overall negative sentiment and broad tech sell-off significantly influence AAPL's price.  The initial pre-market rise in Apple's stock price could be attributed to a flight to safety as investors move from riskier assets into more stable ones like Apple, the least impacted by the emerging market disruption.. However, the sustained negative sentiment and the potential for a broader market correction due to the DeepSeek development suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decrease. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, leaning towards a price decrease, which further supports my conclusion. The uncertainty surrounding the long-term implications of DeepSeek\u2019s success adds to the risk of further market volatility and hence short term decrease in price.  However, Apple\u2019s strong fundamentals and established market position could provide some cushioning against a drastic price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season focus on the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months.

While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding and has a strong capital-return program, the article's focus on Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway stock rather than Apple might slightly overshadow Apple's prospects. However, the overall sentiment about Apple remains positive due to its market share leadership and shareholder return program. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions from various models, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation.

(AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown resilience against the AI sell-off and received positive developments such as JPMorgan raising its iPhone build estimates and potential benefits from more efficient AI models like those developed by DeepSeek. These factors suggest a positive outlook. On the other hand, there are concerns related to iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and overall market sentiment driven by competition, especially from Chinese AI upstarts. Despite some positive predictions, the mixed signals and existing market sentiments suggest cautious optimism.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, poses a significant challenge to US tech stocks, particularly those involved in the AI sector. While Apple has been less affected due to its strong fundamentals and diversified product ecosystem, the overall market sentiment remains negative. Analysts exhibit a prevailing belief that competition from lower-cost, effective alternatives like DeepSeek will pressure valuations across the tech sector, affecting companies like Apple indirectly. Additionally, despite some positive developments in Apple's AI initiatives, the consistent predictions from various models lean towards a higher probability of a stock price decline over a short-term horizon given the current market volatility and negative sentiment. Therefore, while Apple shows resilience, the prevailing risk suggests a stronger likelihood of falling prices compared to rising ones.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The dominant narrative in the provided news and previous predictions is that the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI competitor, has triggered a tech sell-off due to concerns about reduced hardware demand and potential re-evaluation of AI company valuations. While some analyses highlight Apple's relative resilience and strong fundamentals, the overall sentiment remains negative. The initial bounce might be a flight to safety, but the lasting impact appears to be downwards. There are diverse price predictions across models, indicating that uncertainty remains, creating a higher chance of pricing decrease in line with market trends.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot has created a significant negative market reaction, impacting AI-related stocks and the broader tech sector. While Apple's direct exposure to the AI hardware market is less than companies like Nvidia, the overall negative sentiment and broad tech sell-off significantly influence AAPL's price. Apple's initial pre-market rise may be attributed to a flight to safety as investors shifted from riskier assets. However, the sustained negative sentiment and potential for broader market correction due to DeepSeek suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decrease. Previous predictions, while varied, lean towards a price decrease.  The uncertainty surrounding the long-term implications of DeepSeek's success adds to the risk of further market volatility.  Apple's strong fundamentals and established market position could provide some cushioning against a drastic price fall, but the short-term outlook remains negative given the prevailing market conditions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the earnings season focus on the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple (AAPL).

Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The emergence of DeepSeek as a strong competitor in the AI landscape has created significant market turmoil and a negative sentiment towards US tech stocks, including Apple. Despite Apple's comparatively strong fundamentals and its resilience in the face of this news, the overall market is experiencing a sell-off driven by fears of increased competition and reduced valuations across the tech sector. Various models and analyses indicate a tendency towards a price decline for Apple due to the pervasive uncertainty in the market. While there are some positive signals regarding Apple's long-term prospects in AI, the prevailing short-term sentiment remains negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price fall in the immediate future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary news revolves around the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which is triggering a tech sell-off due to concerns about its potential to disrupt the existing market and lower hardware demand. Although Apple has been relatively resilient and the previous analysis showed some positive potential due to AI investment and market share, the overall market sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, leading to a high probability of a stock price decline in the short term. Moreover, even though some analyses showed strong positive surprise history, most emphasize the over negative impacts towards a potential falling price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about DeepSeek's low-cost AI chatbot has created a significant negative market reaction, primarily impacting AI-related stocks and the broader tech sector. While Apple's direct exposure to the AI hardware market is less than companies like Nvidia, the overall negative sentiment and broad tech sell-off significantly influence AAPL's price.  The initial pre-market rise in Apple's stock price could be attributed to a flight to safety as investors moved from riskier assets into more stable ones like Apple, which initially showed less direct impact from the DeepSeek news. However, the sustained negative sentiment, the potential for a broader market correction due to the DeepSeek development, and the consistently negative predictions from previous models suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decrease.  While Apple's strong fundamentals and established market position might provide some cushioning against a drastic price fall, the prevailing negative market conditions and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's long-term impact lean toward a higher probability of a price decline in the short term.  The divergence of opinions among various models highlights the uncertainty surrounding the situation, leading to a moderately conservative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article focuses on the earnings season and the performance of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of an earnings beat. The company has seen no earnings estimate revisions over the past 30 days, and its stock has underperformed the industry, shedding 4.6% over the past three months.

Given the mixed signals and the overall negative sentiment from previous predictions, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's investment strategy and his confidence in various stocks, particularly highlighting that he has been a buyer of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 24 of the last 25 quarters. While Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding and has a strong capital-return program, the article's focus on Buffett's confidence in Berkshire Hathaway stock rather than Apple might slightly overshadow Apple's prospects. However, the overall sentiment about Apple remains positive due to its market share leadership and shareholder return program. Considering the mixed signals and previous predictions from various models, which have consistently shown a higher likelihood of a stock price decline due to market volatility and negative sentiment surrounding the tech sector, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expanding investments in AI, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan's report, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI developers, and AI integrators. The report suggests that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market may be unsustainable, but Apple's strong fundamentals and its position as a leader in the AI space are positive factors. Considering the mixed signals and the overall market sentiment, as well as the previous predictions from various models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. However, given the dominance of negative sentiment in previous predictions and the broader market conditions, a more cautious approach is warranted.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple has shown resilience against the AI sell-off and received positive developments such as JPMorgan raising its iPhone build estimates and potential benefits from more efficient AI models like those developed by DeepSeek. These factors suggest a positive outlook. On the other hand, there are concerns related to iPhone sales, analyst downgrades, and overall market sentiment driven by competition, especially from Chinese AI upstarts. Despite some positive predictions, the mixed signals and existing market sentiments suggest cautious optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
