(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has triggered a significant sell-off in the tech sector, including major companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. While Apple is reported to be less affected than its peers and even managed to rise slightly, it is still in a sector where investor sentiment has turned negative due to fears of increased competition from cheaper and equally capable AI solutions. Given the magnitude of the tech sell-off and Apple's exposure to the semiconductor industry through its products, there is an overall sentiment of caution in the market that may affect Apple's stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple's potential growth driven by AI. An analyst doesn't see AI as a significant catalyst for Apple's growth, citing lack of a clear driver for a super cycle. Furthermore, the article highlights concerns about Apple's declining revenue in China and the challenges faced by its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, especially the Vision Pro's high price competing with Meta's offerings. The comparison to Chinese AI models being developed at a fraction of the cost of US companies adds to the negative sentiment. The article clearly focuses on the limitations and challenges that Apple faces and suggests that other AI stocks may be more promising. Therefore, it's more likely the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is largely positive for Apple.  The enhancements to the App Store, including improved developer tools, a streamlined review process, and better analytics, are likely to attract more developers and improve the overall app ecosystem.  Higher developer participation and a better user experience can lead to increased app downloads and purchases, ultimately boosting Apple's revenue streams.  The high adoption rate of iOS 18 further strengthens this positive outlook, showing strong user engagement and satisfaction. While there's always a degree of uncertainty in the stock market, the overall tone of the news suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase than a decrease.  The news focuses on improvements to existing infrastructure rather than introducing any major new products, thus limiting the potential for a dramatic price swing either way. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights significant updates to Apple's App Store platform, including enhanced tools for developers, improved user experience, and faster adoption rates of iOS 18. These updates are likely to attract more developers to the platform, foster innovation, and improve the overall ecosystem, which could lead to increased revenue streams from app sales and in-app purchases. The positive reception of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, along with the streamlined App Review process, suggests strong customer and developer engagement. Given these factors, the news is perceived as positive for Apple's business prospects, potentially boosting investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a sell-off in major tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI hardware and software. Apple's stock price has been relatively resilient compared to other tech giants, gaining 0.1% in premarket trading. However, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is bearish due to concerns that DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model could disrupt the dominance of US tech companies. Given this context, there is a possibility that Apple's stock price could face downward pressure, short-term. Nevertheless, the effect on Apple's stock might be moderated compared to other companies heavily involved in AI.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant stake in Apple. Historically, Apple's stock performance has had a moderate correlation with Berkshire's stock performance. However, past instances have shown that even when Apple reports exceptionally great results, Berkshire's stock price increase is relatively modest. Additionally, the article mentions that Warren Buffett doesn't seem to think Berkshire's stock is a great pick right now, and analysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for the company. Considering these factors, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's earnings report is relatively low. However, the article also highlights Berkshire's reliable cash flow, diversification, and massive cash stockpile, which could make it a good long-term investment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is also not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and predictions rather than direct factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), making the stock movements of AAPL less predictable based on this news alone. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a critical point of interest. Historically, strong Apple results haven\u2019t shown immediate effects on Berkshire's stock price. This suggests Apple's results should be considered separately from this news when forecasting movements.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news surrounding China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a significant sell-off in the tech sector, affecting major companies including Apple. While Apple has shown some resilience with a slight rise amid the broader market decline, the overall sentiment in the tech industry remains cautious due to fears of increased competition from lower-cost AI solutions. Analysts reflect mixed views, with some highlighting the pressure on Apple from cheaper competitors, while others note the potential for innovation and stability within Apple's ecosystem. Overall, given the current negative sentiment in the market and the potential for further selling pressure from investors reacting to competitive threats, I estimate a higher probability of stock price decline compared to an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally negative outlook for Apple's stock. An analyst believes AI isn't a strong catalyst for growth, pointing out Apple's weaker position compared to its peers in this domain. Concerns about declining revenue in China, challenges with the Vision Pro's high pricing and HomePod's failure to compete with rivals contribute to this sentiment. Also, the news emphasizes cost-effectiveness of other AI models outside the U.S., such as Chinese AI models, adding to the bearish sentiment. Past analyst opinions align with this, where AI is not currently believed to be a driver. Considering this, and the previous negative sentiment, probability of a fall is increased. Although contradictory predictions exists due to potential positive news outside of this news segment, I'm favoring the fall based on my analysis of the news segment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly positive for Apple.  The App Store improvements are significant, focusing on enhancing developer tools, streamlining the review process, and providing better analytics. These improvements are likely to attract more developers, leading to a more vibrant app ecosystem and increased revenue for Apple. The high adoption rate of iOS 18 further reinforces the positive narrative, suggesting strong customer satisfaction and engagement.  While the broader tech market sentiment might be influenced by factors unrelated to Apple (like the DeepSeek AI news mentioned in previous predictions), the company-specific news strongly points towards a positive impact on its stock price. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some emphasizing the negative overall tech market sentiment and some highlighting the positive App Store news. I weigh the direct impact of the App Store news more heavily than the broader market sentiment, as the news is quite specific and impactful to Apple's core business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights significant positive updates to Apple's App Store platform, including enhanced developer tools, improved user experience, and high adoption rates of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. These changes are likely to attract more developers, improve the app ecosystem, and boost revenue streams from app sales and in-app purchases. The positive reception of the latest software versions and the streamlined App Review process indicate strong customer and developer engagement. Given these factors, the news is perceived as favorable for Apple's business prospects, which could positively influence investor confidence and the stock price. While previous predictions varied, the majority of recent models leaned towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock based on this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'US stocks plunge over China\u2019s AI threat' indicates a negative market reaction to China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which threatens to match major global AI competitors at a lower cost. This has led to a significant sell-off in tech stocks, including major companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. Apple's stock is relatively resilient, gaining 0.1% in premarket trading, but the overall sentiment in the tech sector is bearish due to concerns about increased competition from cheaper and equally capable AI solutions. Given this context, there is a possibility that Apple's stock price could face downward pressure, short-term. However, considering Apple's less affected position and strong ecosystem, the probability of a stock price rise is lower than a fall but still considerable in the long term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant stake in Apple. Historically, Apple's stock performance has had a moderate correlation with Berkshire's stock performance. However, past instances have shown that even when Apple reports exceptionally great results, Berkshire's stock price increase is relatively modest.
