(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?\nNews Content: To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news surrounding DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has triggered a significant sell-off in the tech sector, including major companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and others. While Apple is reported to be less affected than its peers and even managed to rise slightly, it is still in a sector where investor sentiment has turned negative due to fears of increased competition from cheaper and equally capable AI solutions. Given the magnitude of the tech sell-off and Apple's exposure to the semiconductor industry through its products, there is an overall sentiment of caution in the market that may affect Apple's stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple's potential growth driven by AI. An analyst doesn't see AI as a significant catalyst for Apple's growth, citing lack of a clear driver for a super cycle. Furthermore, the article highlights concerns about Apple's declining revenue in China and the challenges faced by its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, especially the Vision Pro's high price competing with Meta's offerings. The comparison to Chinese AI models being developed at a fraction of the cost of US companies adds to the negative sentiment. The article clearly focuses on the limitations and challenges that Apple faces and suggests that other AI stocks may be more promising. Therefore, it's more likely the stock price will fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is largely positive for Apple.  The enhancements to the App Store, including improved developer tools, a streamlined review process, and better analytics, are likely to attract more developers and improve the overall app ecosystem.  Higher developer participation and a better user experience can lead to increased app downloads and purchases, ultimately boosting Apple's revenue streams.  The high adoption rate of iOS 18 further strengthens this positive outlook, showing strong user engagement and satisfaction. While there's always a degree of uncertainty in the stock market, the overall tone of the news suggests a higher probability of a stock price increase than a decrease.  The news focuses on improvements to existing infrastructure rather than introducing any major new products, thus limiting the potential for a dramatic price swing either way. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights significant updates to Apple's App Store platform, including enhanced tools for developers, improved user experience, and faster adoption rates of iOS 18. These updates are likely to attract more developers to the platform, foster innovation, and improve the overall ecosystem, which could lead to increased revenue streams from app sales and in-app purchases. The positive reception of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, along with the streamlined App Review process, suggests strong customer and developer engagement. Given these factors, the news is perceived as positive for Apple's business prospects, potentially boosting investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI chatbot has triggered a sell-off in major tech stocks, particularly those involved in AI hardware and software. Apple's stock price has been relatively resilient compared to other tech giants, gaining 0.1% in premarket trading. However, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is bearish due to concerns that DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model could disrupt the dominance of US tech companies. Given this context, there is a possibility that Apple's stock price could face downward pressure, short-term. Nevertheless, the effect on Apple's stock might be moderated compared to other companies heavily involved in AI.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's quarterly earnings report on Berkshire Hathaway's stock price, given Berkshire's significant stake in Apple. Historically, Apple's stock performance has had a moderate correlation with Berkshire's stock performance. However, past instances have shown that even when Apple reports exceptionally great results, Berkshire's stock price increase is relatively modest. Additionally, the article mentions that Warren Buffett doesn't seem to think Berkshire's stock is a great pick right now, and analysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for the company. Considering these factors, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price rising due to Apple's earnings report is relatively low. However, the article also highlights Berkshire's reliable cash flow, diversification, and massive cash stockpile, which could make it a good long-term investment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is also not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and predictions rather than direct factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), making the stock movements of AAPL less predictable based on this news alone. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a critical point of interest. Historically, strong Apple results haven\u2019t shown immediate effects on Berkshire's stock price. This suggests Apple's results should be considered separately from this news when forecasting movements.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
