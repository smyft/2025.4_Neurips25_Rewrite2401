(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the company is expected to see growth in Services, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competitive pressures, particularly from China. The valuation appears stretched, and there's a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment. However, Apple is pushing into AI, which could positively impact long-term prospects. Given the combination of potential short-term challenges and long-term opportunities, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While the situation highlights TikTok's popularity and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The high prices for used iPhones with TikTok are not directly related to Apple's business performance or future prospects.  The event is a relatively isolated incident unlikely to affect Apple's overall financial health or consumer perception.  The news is more of a social media phenomenon than a significant market mover for Apple. Therefore, the probability of any significant stock price movement, either up or down, is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its position in the AI landscape and overall market performance. The key points are: (1) An analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market. (3) Challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. (4) Investor uncertainty around iPhone 16 and AI integration. However, the article also notes that Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors). Given the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised, the sentiment leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong market position may mitigate significant downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are framing their narratives around generative AI. While the news does mention Apple, it does so in the context of comparing how various large companies talk about AI. There is no specific, direct information in the headline or content that suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive movement in Apple's stock price, with a 3.7% jump, due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and Meta's significant AI investments also contribute to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some firms. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive news and sentiments, but also acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties that could lead to a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. However, there are mixed signals regarding the market impact with BofA analyst lowering their price target slightly, citing concerns over a weak macro environment and delayed generative AI feature rollouts. The article mentions that while Apple Inc. remains a strong investment, some competitors might offer higher returns within shorter time frames. Hedge fund holders' interest could provide additional support, but overall the news indicates cautious optimism.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
