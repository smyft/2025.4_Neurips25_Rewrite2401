(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\n\nguteksk7/Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the company is expected to see growth in Services, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competitive pressures, particularly from China. The valuation appears stretched, and there's a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment. However, Apple is pushing into AI, which could positively impact long-term prospects. Given the combination of potential short-term challenges and long-term opportunities, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While the situation highlights TikTok's popularity and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The high prices for used iPhones with TikTok are not directly related to Apple's business performance or future prospects.  The event is a relatively isolated incident unlikely to affect Apple's overall financial health or consumer perception.  The news is more of a social media phenomenon than a significant market mover for Apple. Therefore, the probability of any significant stock price movement, either up or down, is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its position in the AI landscape and overall market performance. The key points are: (1) An analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market. (3) Challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. (4) Investor uncertainty around iPhone 16 and AI integration. However, the article also notes that Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors). Given the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised, the sentiment leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong market position may mitigate significant downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are framing their narratives around generative AI. While the news does mention Apple, it does so in the context of comparing how various large companies talk about AI. There is no specific, direct information in the headline or content that suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive movement in Apple's stock price, with a 3.7% jump, due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and Meta's significant AI investments also contribute to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some firms. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive news and sentiments, but also acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties that could lead to a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. However, there are mixed signals regarding the market impact with BofA analyst lowering their price target slightly, citing concerns over a weak macro environment and delayed generative AI feature rollouts. The article mentions that while Apple Inc. remains a strong investment, some competitors might offer higher returns within shorter time frames. Hedge fund holders' interest could provide additional support, but overall the news indicates cautious optimism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in the Services segment, challenges such as a projected decline in iPhone sales and a potential headwind from the competitive landscape in China raise concerns. The company's strained valuation and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) lean towards negative sentiment. Prior predictions reflect a consensus of bearish outlooks primarily driven by these concerns, despite some positive highlights regarding Apple's AI initiatives. Given the mix of factors, a slightly greater probability of the stock price falling is estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news provides a detailed outlook on Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings, painting a mixed picture. While EPS and revenue are expected to increase year-over-year, a downward revision in EPS estimates suggests potential concerns. The analysis of specific product and geographic revenue segments reveals both growth areas (Services, Mac, iPad, Greater China) and potential weaknesses (iPhone, Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan). Apple's recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate negative near-term sentiment. Considering the detailed segmental analysis and negative indicators outweighing the positive ones, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Other analysts have given conflicting estimates in previous rounds. Given the recent mixed estimates of the previous rounds, and the Zacks sell rating, I will tilt the prediction downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a highly localized and temporary phenomenon.  It's a reaction to a brief TikTok ban, not a reflection of Apple's overall financial health or long-term prospects.  While it demonstrates the popularity of TikTok and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be negligible. The event is essentially irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct impact from this news. Therefore, I assign a very low probability to any significant stock price movement, either up or down.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, an analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing a lack of clear catalysts and the company's already high valuation. Additionally, Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market, and there are challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. On the positive side, Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors), which could provide some support. However, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised about market performance and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple Inc., are framing their narratives around generative AI. The article does not provide specific information that directly suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the mixed outlook for Apple ahead of its earnings report, with potential growth in Services but decline in iPhone sales, and the company's push into AI which could positively impact long-term prospects, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of sentiments, but overall, there seems to be a cautious optimism. Therefore, I estimate a 55% probability of the stock price rising and a 45% probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) but with recent positive developments, such as a 3.7% stock price jump and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates. The potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones, as well as Meta's significant AI investments, contribute to the positive sentiment. However, concerns over iPhone sales and downgrades from some firms could still impact the stock price negatively. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which initially leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling but have recently shown a shift towards more neutral or positive outlooks, I estimate a moderately higher probability of the stock price rising due to the recent positive news and sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. The article indicates a mix of positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, Apple shows continued interest from hedge fund holders and is seen as strengthening its AI position. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, slower iPhone sales, and delays in generative AI feature rollouts. Analysts are cautious but still maintain a 'Buy' rating. Considering the neutral to slightly positive context presented, along with the historical trend in analyst ratings and hedge fund interest, the probability of the stock price rising seems to tilt towards a moderate likelihood.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. with expected growth in the Services segment, but projected declines in iPhone sales due to competition in China and delays in new product features. Although there are positive indicators such as continued growth in Services and increased Mac sales, the overall sentiment is hindered by a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating bearish outlooks and suggesting caution among investors. Given the weight of negative sentiment compared to mixed positive signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a detailed Q1 outlook for Apple with both positive and negative signals. EPS and revenue are projected to increase year-over-year, but the downward revision in EPS estimates is concerning. Product-wise, Services, Mac, and iPad are expected to grow, while iPhone sales may decline slightly. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show positive trends, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan indicate negative growth. Apple's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term weakness. Previous predictions also leaned towards a negative outlook, with some suggesting a slight possibility of a price increase due to Apple's efforts in AI. Considering the recent negative momentum, downward EPS revisions, and the Zacks sell rating, a higher probability is assigned to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for inflated prices is a short-term, anecdotal event with negligible impact on Apple's overall financial health.  The event is primarily a reflection of the temporary disruption caused by the TikTok ban and the subsequent desperation of some users to regain access. It does not reflect on Apple's products, services, or long-term prospects.  While the high prices highlight TikTok's user engagement and Apple's role in app distribution, the effect on Apple's stock price will likely be minimal and transient.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the lack of significant direct impact of this news.  Considering the short-lived nature and insignificant relation to Apple's core business, the likelihood of any substantial stock movement is very low.  Therefore, the probabilities of either a rise or a fall are assigned very low values, closer to neutrality than to a directional movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with several negative factors outweighing potential positives. Key concerns include: (1) An analyst's skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver for Apple, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Declining revenue in China, which accounts for 15% of total revenue. (3) Weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, with Vision Pro facing stiff competition and HomePod's failure. (4) Uncertainty around iPhone 16 growth prospects and AI platform integration. While there is strong hedge fund interest (158 investors), the overall sentiment leans negative due to these challenges. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious to bearish outlook, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, despite some positive elements, the balance of factors suggests a higher likelihood of negative short-term impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, Apple's jump in stock price, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates, and the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones contribute to a positive sentiment. Additionally, Meta's significant AI investments and Apple's push into AI could positively impact long-term prospects. However, concerns over iPhone sales, downgrades from some firms, and the company's strained valuation are negative factors. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which initially leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling but have recently shown a shift towards more neutral or positive outlooks, I estimate a moderately higher probability of the stock price rising due to the recent positive news and sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. The article indicates a mix of positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, Apple shows continued interest from hedge fund holders and is seen as strengthening its AI position. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, slower iPhone sales, and delays in generative AI feature rollouts. Analysts are cautious but still maintain a 'Buy' rating. Considering the neutral to slightly positive context presented, along with the historical trend in analyst ratings and hedge fund interest, the probability of the stock price rising seems to tilt towards a moderate likelihood.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news indicates a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in the Services segment, concerns over iPhone sales declining due to competitive pressures, particularly in China, and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggest a bearish sentiment. Moreover, the downward revision in EPS estimates and the overall high valuation raise caution among investors. Previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these negative sentiments from analysts, despite some positive signals. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a detailed outlook for Apple's Q1 earnings. While revenue and EPS are expected to increase, a downward revision in EPS estimates and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest potential near-term weakness. Strong growth in Services and Mac is offset by a possible decline in iPhone sales. Geographically, Greater China and Europe are doing well, while other regions are not. Previous predictions leaned bearishly, and negative sentiment appears to be solidifying. Considering the downward EPS revisions, the Zacks sell rating, and potential weakness in iPhone sales, a higher probability is assigned to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about inflated prices for iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a temporary ban is essentially irrelevant to Apple's long-term financial health.  It's a short-lived, anecdotal event driven by user panic and FOMO, not by any fundamental change in Apple's business.  While it highlights TikTok's influence and Apple's app distribution system, it doesn't reflect on Apple's product quality, innovation, or overall market position.  The previous predictions show significant divergence, even indicating some level of error in other models.  This confirms the lack of any significant direct impact from this news on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, I've assigned a very low probability to any significant stock price movement, either rise or fall, reflecting that the news is essentially noise in the context of Apple's overall performance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with several negative factors such as declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables segment, and skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver. However, there are some positive elements like strong hedge fund interest and potential long-term benefits from AI initiatives. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious to bearish outlook, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, despite some positive elements, the balance of factors suggests a higher likelihood of negative short-term impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content discuss how major companies, including Apple Inc., are framing their narratives around generative AI.
