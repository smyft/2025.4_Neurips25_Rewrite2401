Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\nNews Content: Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nApple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion. \r\n\r\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base has been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL\u2019s Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo\u2019s growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies\u2019 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple\u2019s market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.5%.\n\nApple Stock\u2019s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 27.54X.\n\nPrice/Earnings (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul. \r\n\r\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the company is expected to see growth in Services, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competitive pressures, particularly from China. The valuation appears stretched, and there's a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment. However, Apple is pushing into AI, which could positively impact long-term prospects. Given the combination of potential short-term challenges and long-term opportunities, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While the situation highlights TikTok's popularity and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The high prices for used iPhones with TikTok are not directly related to Apple's business performance or future prospects.  The event is a relatively isolated incident unlikely to affect Apple's overall financial health or consumer perception.  The news is more of a social media phenomenon than a significant market mover for Apple. Therefore, the probability of any significant stock price movement, either up or down, is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its position in the AI landscape and overall market performance. The key points are: (1) An analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market. (3) Challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. (4) Investor uncertainty around iPhone 16 and AI integration. However, the article also notes that Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors). Given the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised, the sentiment leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong market position may mitigate significant downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are framing their narratives around generative AI. While the news does mention Apple, it does so in the context of comparing how various large companies talk about AI. There is no specific, direct information in the headline or content that suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive movement in Apple's stock price, with a 3.7% jump, due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and Meta's significant AI investments also contribute to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some firms. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive news and sentiments, but also acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties that could lead to a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. However, there are mixed signals regarding the market impact with BofA analyst lowering their price target slightly, citing concerns over a weak macro environment and delayed generative AI feature rollouts. The article mentions that while Apple Inc. remains a strong investment, some competitors might offer higher returns within shorter time frames. Hedge fund holders' interest could provide additional support, but overall the news indicates cautious optimism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in the Services segment, challenges such as a projected decline in iPhone sales and a potential headwind from the competitive landscape in China raise concerns. The company's strained valuation and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) lean towards negative sentiment. Prior predictions reflect a consensus of bearish outlooks primarily driven by these concerns, despite some positive highlights regarding Apple's AI initiatives. Given the mix of factors, a slightly greater probability of the stock price falling is estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news provides a detailed outlook on Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings, painting a mixed picture. While EPS and revenue are expected to increase year-over-year, a downward revision in EPS estimates suggests potential concerns. The analysis of specific product and geographic revenue segments reveals both growth areas (Services, Mac, iPad, Greater China) and potential weaknesses (iPhone, Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan). Apple's recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate negative near-term sentiment. Considering the detailed segmental analysis and negative indicators outweighing the positive ones, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Other analysts have given conflicting estimates in previous rounds. Given the recent mixed estimates of the previous rounds, and the Zacks sell rating, I will tilt the prediction downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a highly localized and temporary phenomenon.  It's a reaction to a brief TikTok ban, not a reflection of Apple's overall financial health or long-term prospects.  While it demonstrates the popularity of TikTok and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be negligible. The event is essentially irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct impact from this news. Therefore, I assign a very low probability to any significant stock price movement, either up or down.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, an analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing a lack of clear catalysts and the company's already high valuation. Additionally, Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market, and there are challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. On the positive side, Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors), which could provide some support. However, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised about market performance and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple Inc., are framing their narratives around generative AI. The article does not provide specific information that directly suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the mixed outlook for Apple ahead of its earnings report, with potential growth in Services but decline in iPhone sales, and the company's push into AI which could positively impact long-term prospects, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of sentiments, but overall, there seems to be a cautious optimism. Therefore, I estimate a 55% probability of the stock price rising and a 45% probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) but with recent positive developments, such as a 3.7% stock price jump and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates. The potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones, as well as Meta's significant AI investments, contribute to the positive sentiment. However, concerns over iPhone sales and downgrades from some firms could still impact the stock price negatively. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which initially leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling but have recently shown a shift towards more neutral or positive outlooks, I estimate a moderately higher probability of the stock price rising due to the recent positive news and sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. The article indicates a mix of positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, Apple shows continued interest from hedge fund holders and is seen as strengthening its AI position. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, slower iPhone sales, and delays in generative AI feature rollouts. Analysts are cautious but still maintain a 'Buy' rating. Considering the neutral to slightly positive context presented, along with the historical trend in analyst ratings and hedge fund interest, the probability of the stock price rising seems to tilt towards a moderate likelihood.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
