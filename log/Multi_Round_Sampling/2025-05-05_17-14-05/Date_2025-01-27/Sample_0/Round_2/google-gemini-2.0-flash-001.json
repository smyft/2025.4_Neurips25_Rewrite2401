(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the company is expected to see growth in Services, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competitive pressures, particularly from China. The valuation appears stretched, and there's a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment. However, Apple is pushing into AI, which could positively impact long-term prospects. Given the combination of potential short-term challenges and long-term opportunities, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While the situation highlights TikTok's popularity and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The high prices for used iPhones with TikTok are not directly related to Apple's business performance or future prospects.  The event is a relatively isolated incident unlikely to affect Apple's overall financial health or consumer perception.  The news is more of a social media phenomenon than a significant market mover for Apple. Therefore, the probability of any significant stock price movement, either up or down, is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its position in the AI landscape and overall market performance. The key points are: (1) An analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market. (3) Challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. (4) Investor uncertainty around iPhone 16 and AI integration. However, the article also notes that Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors). Given the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised, the sentiment leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong market position may mitigate significant downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are framing their narratives around generative AI. While the news does mention Apple, it does so in the context of comparing how various large companies talk about AI. There is no specific, direct information in the headline or content that suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive movement in Apple's stock price, with a 3.7% jump, due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and Meta's significant AI investments also contribute to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some firms. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive news and sentiments, but also acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties that could lead to a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. However, there are mixed signals regarding the market impact with BofA analyst lowering their price target slightly, citing concerns over a weak macro environment and delayed generative AI feature rollouts. The article mentions that while Apple Inc. remains a strong investment, some competitors might offer higher returns within shorter time frames. Hedge fund holders' interest could provide additional support, but overall the news indicates cautious optimism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in the Services segment, challenges such as a projected decline in iPhone sales and a potential headwind from the competitive landscape in China raise concerns. The company's strained valuation and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) lean towards negative sentiment. Prior predictions reflect a consensus of bearish outlooks primarily driven by these concerns, despite some positive highlights regarding Apple's AI initiatives. Given the mix of factors, a slightly greater probability of the stock price falling is estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news provides a detailed outlook on Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings, painting a mixed picture. While EPS and revenue are expected to increase year-over-year, a downward revision in EPS estimates suggests potential concerns. The analysis of specific product and geographic revenue segments reveals both growth areas (Services, Mac, iPad, Greater China) and potential weaknesses (iPhone, Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan). Apple's recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate negative near-term sentiment. Considering the detailed segmental analysis and negative indicators outweighing the positive ones, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Other analysts have given conflicting estimates in previous rounds. Given the recent mixed estimates of the previous rounds, and the Zacks sell rating, I will tilt the prediction downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a highly localized and temporary phenomenon.  It's a reaction to a brief TikTok ban, not a reflection of Apple's overall financial health or long-term prospects.  While it demonstrates the popularity of TikTok and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be negligible. The event is essentially irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct impact from this news. Therefore, I assign a very low probability to any significant stock price movement, either up or down.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, an analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing a lack of clear catalysts and the company's already high valuation. Additionally, Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market, and there are challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. On the positive side, Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors), which could provide some support. However, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised about market performance and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple Inc., are framing their narratives around generative AI. The article does not provide specific information that directly suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the mixed outlook for Apple ahead of its earnings report, with potential growth in Services but decline in iPhone sales, and the company's push into AI which could positively impact long-term prospects, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of sentiments, but overall, there seems to be a cautious optimism. Therefore, I estimate a 55% probability of the stock price rising and a 45% probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) but with recent positive developments, such as a 3.7% stock price jump and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates. The potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones, as well as Meta's significant AI investments, contribute to the positive sentiment. However, concerns over iPhone sales and downgrades from some firms could still impact the stock price negatively. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which initially leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling but have recently shown a shift towards more neutral or positive outlooks, I estimate a moderately higher probability of the stock price rising due to the recent positive news and sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. The article indicates a mix of positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, Apple shows continued interest from hedge fund holders and is seen as strengthening its AI position. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, slower iPhone sales, and delays in generative AI feature rollouts. Analysts are cautious but still maintain a 'Buy' rating. Considering the neutral to slightly positive context presented, along with the historical trend in analyst ratings and hedge fund interest, the probability of the stock price rising seems to tilt towards a moderate likelihood.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
