(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news provides a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While the company is expected to see growth in Services, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competitive pressures, particularly from China. The valuation appears stretched, and there's a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicating bearish sentiment. However, Apple is pushing into AI, which could positively impact long-term prospects. Given the combination of potential short-term challenges and long-term opportunities, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While projected earnings per share and revenue show year-over-year increases, there's a recent downward revision in EPS estimates, signaling some analyst concern. The revenue breakdown reveals strong growth in services, Mac, and iPad, but a slight decline in iPhone revenue, which is a significant driver for Apple. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show growth, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan are projected to decline. The positive gross margin in services is encouraging. However, Apple's recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term underperformance. Considering both positive and negative indicators, the market reaction is uncertain, with a slightly greater chance of a price fall due to recent negative momentum and the Zacks rating.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article describes a temporary frenzy surrounding iPhones with TikTok pre-installed due to a brief ban. While the situation highlights TikTok's popularity and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The high prices for used iPhones with TikTok are not directly related to Apple's business performance or future prospects.  The event is a relatively isolated incident unlikely to affect Apple's overall financial health or consumer perception.  The news is more of a social media phenomenon than a significant market mover for Apple. Therefore, the probability of any significant stock price movement, either up or down, is considered low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding its position in the AI landscape and overall market performance. The key points are: (1) An analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market. (3) Challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. (4) Investor uncertainty around iPhone 16 and AI integration. However, the article also notes that Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors). Given the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised, the sentiment leans slightly negative, but Apple's strong market position may mitigate significant downside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content discuss how major companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), are framing their narratives around generative AI. While the news does mention Apple, it does so in the context of comparing how various large companies talk about AI. There is no specific, direct information in the headline or content that suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article indicates a positive movement in Apple's stock price, with a 3.7% jump, due to the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones. Additionally, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates and Meta's significant AI investments also contribute to the positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs due to iPhone sales concerns and downgrades from some firms. Considering these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive news and sentiments, but also acknowledge the potential risks and uncertainties that could lead to a fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strengthening position in the AI market with the launch of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. However, there are mixed signals regarding the market impact with BofA analyst lowering their price target slightly, citing concerns over a weak macro environment and delayed generative AI feature rollouts. The article mentions that while Apple Inc. remains a strong investment, some competitors might offer higher returns within shorter time frames. Hedge fund holders' interest could provide additional support, but overall the news indicates cautious optimism.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. ahead of its Q1 earnings report. While there is expected growth in the Services segment, challenges such as a projected decline in iPhone sales and a potential headwind from the competitive landscape in China raise concerns. The company's strained valuation and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) lean towards negative sentiment. Prior predictions reflect a consensus of bearish outlooks primarily driven by these concerns, despite some positive highlights regarding Apple's AI initiatives. Given the mix of factors, a slightly greater probability of the stock price falling is estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news provides a detailed outlook on Apple's upcoming Q1 earnings, painting a mixed picture. While EPS and revenue are expected to increase year-over-year, a downward revision in EPS estimates suggests potential concerns. The analysis of specific product and geographic revenue segments reveals both growth areas (Services, Mac, iPad, Greater China) and potential weaknesses (iPhone, Rest of Asia Pacific, Japan). Apple's recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate negative near-term sentiment. Considering the detailed segmental analysis and negative indicators outweighing the positive ones, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Other analysts have given conflicting estimates in previous rounds. Given the recent mixed estimates of the previous rounds, and the Zacks sell rating, I will tilt the prediction downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for exorbitant prices on eBay is a highly localized and temporary phenomenon.  It's a reaction to a brief TikTok ban, not a reflection of Apple's overall financial health or long-term prospects.  While it demonstrates the popularity of TikTok and Apple's role in app distribution, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be negligible. The event is essentially irrelevant to Apple's core business and financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the lack of direct impact from this news. Therefore, I assign a very low probability to any significant stock price movement, either up or down.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the negative side, an analyst downplays AI as a significant driver for Apple's growth, citing a lack of clear catalysts and the company's already high valuation. Additionally, Apple's revenue in China has declined, which is a critical market, and there are challenges in the Wearables and Accessories segment, including high competition and pricing issues. On the positive side, Apple still has strong hedge fund interest (158 investors), which could provide some support. However, the overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the concerns raised about market performance and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline discusses how major companies, including Apple Inc., are framing their narratives around generative AI. The article does not provide specific information that directly suggests a significant impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering the mixed outlook for Apple ahead of its earnings report, with potential growth in Services but decline in iPhone sales, and the company's push into AI which could positively impact long-term prospects, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of sentiments, but overall, there seems to be a cautious optimism. Therefore, I estimate a 55% probability of the stock price rising and a 45% probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) but with recent positive developments, such as a 3.7% stock price jump and JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates. The potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones, as well as Meta's significant AI investments, contribute to the positive sentiment. However, concerns over iPhone sales and downgrades from some firms could still impact the stock price negatively. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which initially leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling but have recently shown a shift towards more neutral or positive outlooks, I estimate a moderately higher probability of the stock price rising due to the recent positive news and sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Apple Inc.'s efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. The article indicates a mix of positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, Apple shows continued interest from hedge fund holders and is seen as strengthening its AI position. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, slower iPhone sales, and delays in generative AI feature rollouts. Analysts are cautious but still maintain a 'Buy' rating. Considering the neutral to slightly positive context presented, along with the historical trend in analyst ratings and hedge fund interest, the probability of the stock price rising seems to tilt towards a moderate likelihood.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. with expected growth in the Services segment, but projected declines in iPhone sales due to competition in China and delays in new product features. Although there are positive indicators such as continued growth in Services and increased Mac sales, the overall sentiment is hindered by a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), indicating bearish outlooks and suggesting caution among investors. Given the weight of negative sentiment compared to mixed positive signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a detailed Q1 outlook for Apple with both positive and negative signals. EPS and revenue are projected to increase year-over-year, but the downward revision in EPS estimates is concerning. Product-wise, Services, Mac, and iPad are expected to grow, while iPhone sales may decline slightly. Geographically, Greater China and Europe show positive trends, but the Rest of Asia Pacific and Japan indicate negative growth. Apple's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggest near-term weakness. Previous predictions also leaned towards a negative outlook, with some suggesting a slight possibility of a price increase due to Apple's efforts in AI. Considering the recent negative momentum, downward EPS revisions, and the Zacks sell rating, a higher probability is assigned to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok pre-installed selling for inflated prices is a short-term, anecdotal event with negligible impact on Apple's overall financial health.  The event is primarily a reflection of the temporary disruption caused by the TikTok ban and the subsequent desperation of some users to regain access. It does not reflect on Apple's products, services, or long-term prospects.  While the high prices highlight TikTok's user engagement and Apple's role in app distribution, the effect on Apple's stock price will likely be minimal and transient.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the lack of significant direct impact of this news.  Considering the short-lived nature and insignificant relation to Apple's core business, the likelihood of any substantial stock movement is very low.  Therefore, the probabilities of either a rise or a fall are assigned very low values, closer to neutrality than to a directional movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with several negative factors outweighing potential positives. Key concerns include: (1) An analyst's skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver for Apple, citing lack of clear catalysts and a fully valued stock. (2) Declining revenue in China, which accounts for 15% of total revenue. (3) Weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, with Vision Pro facing stiff competition and HomePod's failure. (4) Uncertainty around iPhone 16 growth prospects and AI platform integration. While there is strong hedge fund interest (158 investors), the overall sentiment leans negative due to these challenges. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious to bearish outlook, with most models estimating a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, despite some positive elements, the balance of factors suggests a higher likelihood of negative short-term impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view on Apple Inc. (AAPL) with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, Apple's jump in stock price, JPMorgan's raised iPhone build estimates, and the potential benefits of smaller and more efficient AI models for iPhones contribute to a positive sentiment. Additionally, Meta's significant AI investments and Apple's push into AI could positively impact long-term prospects. However, concerns over iPhone sales, downgrades from some firms, and the company's strained valuation are negative factors. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which initially leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling but have recently shown a shift towards more neutral or positive outlooks, I estimate a moderately higher probability of the stock price rising due to the recent positive news and sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s efforts to strengthen its AI leadership with Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system. The article indicates a mix of positive and negative sentiments. On the positive side, Apple shows continued interest from hedge fund holders and is seen as strengthening its AI position. However, there are concerns about macroeconomic headwinds, slower iPhone sales, and delays in generative AI feature rollouts. Analysts are cautious but still maintain a 'Buy' rating.
