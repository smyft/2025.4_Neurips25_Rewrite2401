A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a major holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. His positive comments about Apple and its leadership position in the smartphone market, alongside the successful capital-return program, reinforce a generally favorable outlook. However, the sale of a substantial number of shares by Berkshire could introduce some uncertainty. Nonetheless, Buffett's history of consistent buybacks and investment suggests a strong belief in Apple's future, which is likely to positively influence market sentiment. Overall, the strong confidence displayed by a respected investor like Buffett increases the expected probability of the stock's price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since hitting a 52-week high due to China worries and AI strategy concerns, there's also optimism. Analysts anticipate stable EPS estimates for the December quarter and a potential announcement of a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. Current fiscal year EPS estimates are slightly down. Overall, the negative sentiment seems priced in, countered by a local AI partnership to possibly fuel growth. Weighing the negative pressure of recent performance and potential for a guidance cut by bearish analysts alongside the potential positive catalyst of the local AI partnership announcement, there are nearly equal competing predictions for share price rise or decline. The news also focuses on TSLA, META, and MSFT, however, for AAPL, the China AI strategy and earnings will influence the price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with Apple Intelligence and its strong position amongst AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and a slower-than-expected rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens the near-term outlook. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future potential. The overall narrative suggests a cautious optimism; while the AI integration is positive long-term, short-term market conditions and the slower-than-anticipated adoption of AI features present a risk.  Therefore the probabilities are weighted to reflect this balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks' performances, but past instances indicate that even strong Apple results have led to only modest gains for Berkshire (less than 2%). The article also highlights that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. While Apple's results could slightly influence Berkshire's stock, the overall impact is likely limited. The article does not suggest any direct negative impact on Apple's stock from this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the current trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants as indicated in the news, suggesting that investors might still have confidence in its diversified business model.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling. Format your response in JSON format and include the following information as follows: \n{ \n\"reasoning\": \"[Summarize your analysis and reasoning process here]\", \n\"company_name\": \"[Company Name indicating the name of the company]\", \n\"company_symbol\": \"[Company Symbol indicating the stock symbol of the company]\", \n\"news_headline\": \"[News Headline indicating the provided financial news headline]\", \n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will rise due to this news], \n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will fall due to this news], \n} \nDo not generate output that isn't in properly formatted JSON."
