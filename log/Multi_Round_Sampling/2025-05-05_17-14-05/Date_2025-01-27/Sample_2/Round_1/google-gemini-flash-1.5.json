(AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a major holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. His positive comments about Apple and its leadership position in the smartphone market, alongside the successful capital-return program, reinforce a generally favorable outlook. However, the sale of a substantial number of shares by Berkshire could introduce some uncertainty. Nonetheless, Buffett's history of consistent buybacks and investment suggests a strong belief in Apple's future, which is likely to positively influence market sentiment. Overall, the strong confidence displayed by a respected investor like Buffett increases the expected probability of the stock's price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since hitting a 52-week high due to China worries and AI strategy concerns, there's also optimism. Analysts anticipate stable EPS estimates for the December quarter and a potential announcement of a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. Current fiscal year EPS estimates are slightly down. Overall, the negative sentiment seems priced in, countered by a local AI partnership to possibly fuel growth. Weighing the negative pressure of recent performance and potential for a guidance cut by bearish analysts alongside the potential positive catalyst of the local AI partnership announcement, there are nearly equal competing predictions for share price rise or decline. The news also focuses on TSLA, META, and MSFT, however, for AAPL, the China AI strategy and earnings will influence the price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with Apple Intelligence and its strong position amongst AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and a slower-than-expected rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens the near-term outlook. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future potential. The overall narrative suggests a cautious optimism; while the AI integration is positive long-term, short-term market conditions and the slower-than-anticipated adoption of AI features present a risk.  Therefore the probabilities are weighted to reflect this balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks' performances, but past instances indicate that even strong Apple results have led to only modest gains for Berkshire (less than 2%). The article also highlights that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. While Apple's results could slightly influence Berkshire's stock, the overall impact is likely limited. The article does not suggest any direct negative impact on Apple's stock from this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the current trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants as indicated in the news, suggesting that investors might still have confidence in its diversified business model.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While the headline highlights Apple's AI advancements, the article itself reveals a lowered price target from BofA due to a weak macroeconomic environment and slower-than-expected AI feature adoption.  The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further adds to near-term concerns.  However, the maintained 'Buy' rating suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, strong profit margins, and robust cash flow.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, underscoring the uncertainty. The advancement of Chinese AI, and its potential impact on the broader tech sector, adds another layer of complexity. Considering the conflicting signals, a cautious outlook is warranted, leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall given the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term AI potential in the short term.  The fact that the analyst lowered their estimate despite anticipating a 'strong report' suggests the market may already be pricing in some positive news, leaving less room for significant upside from the earnings report itself.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Inc.
