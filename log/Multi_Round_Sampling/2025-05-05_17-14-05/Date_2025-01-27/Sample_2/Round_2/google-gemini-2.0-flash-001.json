(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

His positive comments about Apple and its leadership position in the smartphone market, alongside the successful capital-return program, reinforce a generally favorable outlook. However, the sale of a substantial number of shares by Berkshire could introduce some uncertainty. Nonetheless, Buffett's history of consistent buybacks and investment suggests a strong belief in Apple's future, which is likely to positively influence market sentiment. Overall, the strong confidence displayed by a respected investor like Buffett increases the expected probability of the stock's price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since hitting a 52-week high due to China worries and AI strategy concerns, there's also optimism. Analysts anticipate stable EPS estimates for the December quarter and a potential announcement of a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. Current fiscal year EPS estimates are slightly down. Overall, the negative sentiment seems priced in, countered by a local AI partnership to possibly fuel growth. Weighing the negative pressure of recent performance and potential for a guidance cut by bearish analysts alongside the potential positive catalyst of the local AI partnership announcement, there are nearly equal competing predictions for share price rise or decline. The news also focuses on TSLA, META, and MSFT, however, for AAPL, the China AI strategy and earnings will influence the price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with Apple Intelligence and its strong position amongst AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and a slower-than-expected rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens the near-term outlook. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future potential. The overall narrative suggests a cautious optimism; while the AI integration is positive long-term, short-term market conditions and the slower-than-anticipated adoption of AI features present a risk.  Therefore the probabilities are weighted to reflect this balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks' performances, but past instances indicate that even strong Apple results have led to only modest gains for Berkshire (less than 2%). The article also highlights that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. While Apple's results could slightly influence Berkshire's stock, the overall impact is likely limited. The article does not suggest any direct negative impact on Apple's stock from this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the current trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants as indicated in the news, suggesting that investors might still have confidence in its diversified business model.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. and highlights the company's strong standing and aggressive capital-return program. Despite the recent sales of a significant portion of Apple's shares by Berkshire Hathaway, which introduces some uncertainty, Buffett's historical buybacks and general praise for Apple contribute to a favorable outlook. However, there have been concerns about Apple's performance and potential guidance cuts affecting short-term expectations. Considering the mixed sentiment but overall strong backing from a respected investor like Buffett, I estimate a higher probability for stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to existing headwinds discussed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Several factors point to a potential decline: the stock's recent underperformance (down 15% from its 52-week high), concerns about its China business and AI strategy, and some bearish analysts projecting a guidance cut, as well as downward revisions to the fiscal year EPS consensus. The fact that estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure cannot be overlooked. However, there's also a potential upside: Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that the China headwinds are manageable. The expectation that Apple will announce a local AI partner (potentially Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance) serves as a potential catalyst. Considering the mixed signals and taking into account previous predictions that lean towards negative sentiment, I believe the probability of the stock falling is slightly higher than rising. Prior rounds have displayed decreasing confidence. I am lowering the rise probability to reflect this trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the headline highlights Apple's AI advancements, the article itself reveals a lowered price target from BofA due to a weak macroeconomic environment and slower-than-expected AI feature adoption.  The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further adds to near-term concerns.  However, the maintained 'Buy' rating suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, strong profit margins, and robust cash flow.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, underscoring the uncertainty. The advancement of Chinese AI, and its potential impact on the broader tech sector, adds another layer of complexity. Considering the conflicting signals, a cautious outlook is warranted, leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall given the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term AI potential in the short term.  The fact that the analyst lowered their estimate despite anticipating a 'strong report' suggests the market may already be pricing in some positive news, leaving less room for significant upside from the earnings report itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming quarterly results for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential impact on Berkshire Hathaway's stock. While Berkshire has a significant holding in Apple, historical data shows only a moderate correlation between their stock performances, with Berkshire's stock showing minimal movement even when Apple reports strong results. The article also notes that Apple's recent AI features (Apple Intelligence) may not have significantly boosted iPhone sales, and Berkshire's current valuation is not seen as attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. Given these factors, the direct impact of Apple's results on its own stock price is uncertain, but the broader context suggests limited upside potential. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, with probabilities often favoring a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, and weighing the predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook, and the high P/E ratio indicates that the stock may be overvalued. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified business model could still attract investors, which is why the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot. Apple, though less impacted compared to other tech giants, still faces market turbulence. The news indicates that Nvidia, a critical chip supplier, has seen a significant decline, impacting the entire tech sector. Apple's diversified business model might provide some resilience, but the broader market sentiment and the impact of AI on tech stocks could outweigh individual company strengths. The multiple rounds of predictions show a trend toward more pessimistic views, suggesting a cautious approach is necessary.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
