His positive comments about Apple and its leadership position in the smartphone market, alongside the successful capital-return program, reinforce a generally favorable outlook. However, the sale of a substantial number of shares by Berkshire could introduce some uncertainty. Nonetheless, Buffett's history of consistent buybacks and investment suggests a strong belief in Apple's future, which is likely to positively influence market sentiment. Overall, the strong confidence displayed by a respected investor like Buffett increases the expected probability of the stock's price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since hitting a 52-week high due to China worries and AI strategy concerns, there's also optimism. Analysts anticipate stable EPS estimates for the December quarter and a potential announcement of a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. Current fiscal year EPS estimates are slightly down. Overall, the negative sentiment seems priced in, countered by a local AI partnership to possibly fuel growth. Weighing the negative pressure of recent performance and potential for a guidance cut by bearish analysts alongside the potential positive catalyst of the local AI partnership announcement, there are nearly equal competing predictions for share price rise or decline. The news also focuses on TSLA, META, and MSFT, however, for AAPL, the China AI strategy and earnings will influence the price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with Apple Intelligence and its strong position amongst AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and a slower-than-expected rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens the near-term outlook. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future potential. The overall narrative suggests a cautious optimism; while the AI integration is positive long-term, short-term market conditions and the slower-than-anticipated adoption of AI features present a risk.  Therefore the probabilities are weighted to reflect this balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks' performances, but past instances indicate that even strong Apple results have led to only modest gains for Berkshire (less than 2%). The article also highlights that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. While Apple's results could slightly influence Berkshire's stock, the overall impact is likely limited. The article does not suggest any direct negative impact on Apple's stock from this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the current trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants as indicated in the news, suggesting that investors might still have confidence in its diversified business model.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. and highlights the company's strong standing and aggressive capital-return program. Despite the recent sales of a significant portion of Apple's shares by Berkshire Hathaway, which introduces some uncertainty, Buffett's historical buybacks and general praise for Apple contribute to a favorable outlook. However, there have been concerns about Apple's performance and potential guidance cuts affecting short-term expectations. Considering the mixed sentiment but overall strong backing from a respected investor like Buffett, I estimate a higher probability for stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to existing headwinds discussed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Several factors point to a potential decline: the stock's recent underperformance (down 15% from its 52-week high), concerns about its China business and AI strategy, and some bearish analysts projecting a guidance cut, as well as downward revisions to the fiscal year EPS consensus. The fact that estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure cannot be overlooked. However, there's also a potential upside: Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that the China headwinds are manageable. The expectation that Apple will announce a local AI partner (potentially Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance) serves as a potential catalyst. Considering the mixed signals and taking into account previous predictions that lean towards negative sentiment, I believe the probability of the stock falling is slightly higher than rising. Prior rounds have displayed decreasing confidence. I am lowering the rise probability to reflect this trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the headline highlights Apple's AI advancements, the article itself reveals a lowered price target from BofA due to a weak macroeconomic environment and slower-than-expected AI feature adoption.  The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further adds to near-term concerns.  However, the maintained 'Buy' rating suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, strong profit margins, and robust cash flow.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, underscoring the uncertainty. The advancement of Chinese AI, and its potential impact on the broader tech sector, adds another layer of complexity. Considering the conflicting signals, a cautious outlook is warranted, leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall given the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term AI potential in the short term.  The fact that the analyst lowered their estimate despite anticipating a 'strong report' suggests the market may already be pricing in some positive news, leaving less room for significant upside from the earnings report itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming quarterly results for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential impact on Berkshire Hathaway's stock. While Berkshire has a significant holding in Apple, historical data shows only a moderate correlation between their stock performances, with Berkshire's stock showing minimal movement even when Apple reports strong results. The article also notes that Apple's recent AI features (Apple Intelligence) may not have significantly boosted iPhone sales, and Berkshire's current valuation is not seen as attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. Given these factors, the direct impact of Apple's results on its own stock price is uncertain, but the broader context suggests limited upside potential. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, with probabilities often favoring a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, and weighing the predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook, and the high P/E ratio indicates that the stock may be overvalued. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified business model could still attract investors, which is why the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot. Apple, though less impacted compared to other tech giants, still faces market turbulence. The news indicates that Nvidia, a critical chip supplier, has seen a significant decline, impacting the entire tech sector. Apple's diversified business model might provide some resilience, but the broader market sentiment and the impact of AI on tech stocks could outweigh individual company strengths. The multiple rounds of predictions show a trend toward more pessimistic views, suggesting a cautious approach is necessary.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, showcasing its strong fundamentals and aggressive capital-return program. Despite recent share sales by Berkshire Hathaway, which introduces some uncertainty, Buffett's consistent buybacks and positive views reinforce a generally favorable outlook for Apple. However, mixed signals from analysts regarding Apple's performance and macroeconomic challenges, including the impact of AI strategies, create some headwinds. Recent predictions from various models reflect a trend towards caution, with most indicating a slightly higher probability of stock price decline than rise due to these mixed sentiments. Overall, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price fall given current market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article paints a somewhat negative picture for Apple ahead of its earnings report. The stock has lagged behind its 'Magnificent 7' peers, and there are concerns regarding its AI strategy and exposure to China. Bearish analysts are projecting guidance cuts, and EPS estimates for the current and subsequent fiscal years have been revised downwards. While there's some hope that Apple will announce a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance), the overall sentiment appears to be leaning towards the pessimistic side. Adding to this is the consistent negative sentiment expressed in previous rounds by other models, along with a general trend of decreasing confidence. I will give this news more weight than Buffett's confidence since analysts and the market trend may give information that Buffett do not know.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the headline emphasizes Apple's AI efforts, the content reveals concerns. A BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and slower-than-expected AI adoption.  Reduced iPhone Q2 unit estimates further dampen the near-term outlook. However, the analyst's maintained 'Buy' rating suggests confidence in long-term prospects and strong fundamentals.  The rise of Chinese AI also adds uncertainty to the tech sector.  The previous predictions show a trend toward pessimism, with probabilities consistently favoring a price fall.  Considering these factors \u2013 near-term headwinds, long-term potential, and the prevailing market sentiment reflected in the prior predictions \u2013 I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall in the short term. However, the strong fundamentals and long term positive outlook mitigates this significantly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple.

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, with probabilities often favoring a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, and weighing the predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.

However, Apple's strong brand and diversified business model could still attract investors, which is why the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks as a result of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot emerging as a competitive threat to leading AI companies. Despite mentioning that Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants, the overarching sentiment of market anxiety and the sell-off in major tech stocks, including Nvidia and Microsoft, pose significant risks. Apple faces a challenging market environment and potential concerns about its AI strategy and guidance. The previous rounds of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by factors such as earnings ESP, Zacks Rank, high P/E ratio, and the bearish outlook of analysts. However, Apple\u2019s strong brand image and diversified business model could still attract investors.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals and aggressive capital-return program. However, there are mixed signals regarding recent share sales by Berkshire Hathaway and concerns about Apple's performance, particularly related to its AI strategy and potential guidance cuts. Previous predictions from various models indicated a trend towards caution, with the majority favoring a slight probability of stock price decline due to existing market pressures and analyst concerns. Overall, despite Buffett's confidence, current macroeconomic challenges and analyst sentiment suggest a slightly higher likelihood of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article indicates a mixed outlook for Apple as they enter their earnings week. While the overall Q4 earnings are expected to be positive for the S&P 500 companies, Apple has been lagging behind the 'Mag 7' and is facing concerns related to its China operations and AI strategy. There are projections of potential guidance cuts by bearish analysts and some downward revisions of EPS estimates. On the brighter side, the company might announce a local AI partnership, potentially with Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance. Considering previous predictions show decreasing confidence in Apple, combined with the mixed signals from this article, I lean towards a slightly negative outlook. However, Apple's proven business and large following indicate it won't completely fall. I anticipate most negative news is priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive aspects include Warren Buffett's continued confidence (though tempered by Berkshire Hathaway's recent share sales), Apple's strong position in the AI sector with Apple Intelligence, and its robust fundamentals (strong profit margins, cash flow).  Negative aspects include a weak macroeconomic environment, slower-than-expected AI adoption, lowered iPhone unit estimates, concerns about China's rapidly advancing AI sector (and the potential impact on Nvidia, a key supplier), and bearish analyst projections of guidance cuts.  The previous predictions show a clear trend toward pessimism, with the probability of a price fall consistently higher than a price rise across multiple rounds and different models. This trend is further influenced by the overall market sentiment toward the tech sector. While Apple's diversification might offer some resilience, the prevailing negative sentiment, and the tangible near-term concerns outweigh the long-term potential in the short term. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of unexpected positive developments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple.
