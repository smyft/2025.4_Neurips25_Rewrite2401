(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 ETFs to Watch This Earnings Season\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. as a major holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. His positive comments about Apple and its leadership position in the smartphone market, alongside the successful capital-return program, reinforce a generally favorable outlook. However, the sale of a substantial number of shares by Berkshire could introduce some uncertainty. Nonetheless, Buffett's history of consistent buybacks and investment suggests a strong belief in Apple's future, which is likely to positively influence market sentiment. Overall, the strong confidence displayed by a respected investor like Buffett increases the expected probability of the stock's price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple shares have underperformed recently, losing 15% since hitting a 52-week high due to China worries and AI strategy concerns, there's also optimism. Analysts anticipate stable EPS estimates for the December quarter and a potential announcement of a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance). Bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. Current fiscal year EPS estimates are slightly down. Overall, the negative sentiment seems priced in, countered by a local AI partnership to possibly fuel growth. Weighing the negative pressure of recent performance and potential for a guidance cut by bearish analysts alongside the potential positive catalyst of the local AI partnership announcement, there are nearly equal competing predictions for share price rise or decline. The news also focuses on TSLA, META, and MSFT, however, for AAPL, the China AI strategy and earnings will influence the price in the near term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple's entry into the AI market with Apple Intelligence and its strong position amongst AI stocks,  a BofA analyst lowered Apple's price target due to a weak macro environment and a slower-than-expected rollout of AI features.  The lowered iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further dampens the near-term outlook. However, the analyst maintains a 'Buy' rating, citing strong profit margins and future potential. The overall narrative suggests a cautious optimism; while the AI integration is positive long-term, short-term market conditions and the slower-than-anticipated adoption of AI features present a risk.  Therefore the probabilities are weighted to reflect this balance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks' performances, but past instances indicate that even strong Apple results have led to only modest gains for Berkshire (less than 2%). The article also highlights that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. While Apple's results could slightly influence Berkshire's stock, the overall impact is likely limited. The article does not suggest any direct negative impact on Apple's stock from this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the current trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot, which has significantly impacted companies such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants as indicated in the news, suggesting that investors might still have confidence in its diversified business model.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc. and highlights the company's strong standing and aggressive capital-return program. Despite the recent sales of a significant portion of Apple's shares by Berkshire Hathaway, which introduces some uncertainty, Buffett's historical buybacks and general praise for Apple contribute to a favorable outlook. However, there have been concerns about Apple's performance and potential guidance cuts affecting short-term expectations. Considering the mixed sentiment but overall strong backing from a respected investor like Buffett, I estimate a higher probability for stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so due to existing headwinds discussed.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Several factors point to a potential decline: the stock's recent underperformance (down 15% from its 52-week high), concerns about its China business and AI strategy, and some bearish analysts projecting a guidance cut, as well as downward revisions to the fiscal year EPS consensus. The fact that estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure cannot be overlooked. However, there's also a potential upside: Apple bulls believe the downbeat sentiment is overdone and that the China headwinds are manageable. The expectation that Apple will announce a local AI partner (potentially Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance) serves as a potential catalyst. Considering the mixed signals and taking into account previous predictions that lean towards negative sentiment, I believe the probability of the stock falling is slightly higher than rising. Prior rounds have displayed decreasing confidence. I am lowering the rise probability to reflect this trend.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the headline highlights Apple's AI advancements, the article itself reveals a lowered price target from BofA due to a weak macroeconomic environment and slower-than-expected AI feature adoption.  The reduced iPhone unit estimate for Q2 further adds to near-term concerns.  However, the maintained 'Buy' rating suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, strong profit margins, and robust cash flow.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, underscoring the uncertainty. The advancement of Chinese AI, and its potential impact on the broader tech sector, adds another layer of complexity. Considering the conflicting signals, a cautious outlook is warranted, leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall given the near-term concerns outweighing the long-term AI potential in the short term.  The fact that the analyst lowered their estimate despite anticipating a 'strong report' suggests the market may already be pricing in some positive news, leaving less room for significant upside from the earnings report itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming quarterly results for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential impact on Berkshire Hathaway's stock. While Berkshire has a significant holding in Apple, historical data shows only a moderate correlation between their stock performances, with Berkshire's stock showing minimal movement even when Apple reports strong results. The article also notes that Apple's recent AI features (Apple Intelligence) may not have significantly boosted iPhone sales, and Berkshire's current valuation is not seen as attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. Given these factors, the direct impact of Apple's results on its own stock price is uncertain, but the broader context suggests limited upside potential. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, with probabilities often favoring a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses the earnings season for the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's earnings ESP is -1.51%, and it has a Zacks Rank #4, indicating a potential for a negative earnings surprise. The company's earnings growth is expected to be modest at 8.3% year-over-year, and revenue growth is expected to be 3.7%. Additionally, Apple's recent AI applications have not boosted iPhone sales as expected, and the company provided weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Considering these factors, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, and weighing the predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook, and the high P/E ratio indicates that the stock may be overvalued. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified business model could still attract investors, which is why the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot. Apple, though less impacted compared to other tech giants, still faces market turbulence. The news indicates that Nvidia, a critical chip supplier, has seen a significant decline, impacting the entire tech sector. Apple's diversified business model might provide some resilience, but the broader market sentiment and the impact of AI on tech stocks could outweigh individual company strengths. The multiple rounds of predictions show a trend toward more pessimistic views, suggesting a cautious approach is necessary.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple, showcasing its strong fundamentals and aggressive capital-return program. Despite recent share sales by Berkshire Hathaway, which introduces some uncertainty, Buffett's consistent buybacks and positive views reinforce a generally favorable outlook for Apple. However, mixed signals from analysts regarding Apple's performance and macroeconomic challenges, including the impact of AI strategies, create some headwinds. Recent predictions from various models reflect a trend towards caution, with most indicating a slightly higher probability of stock price decline than rise due to these mixed sentiments. Overall, I estimate a balanced outlook with a slight inclination towards a price fall given current market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article paints a somewhat negative picture for Apple ahead of its earnings report. The stock has lagged behind its 'Magnificent 7' peers, and there are concerns regarding its AI strategy and exposure to China. Bearish analysts are projecting guidance cuts, and EPS estimates for the current and subsequent fiscal years have been revised downwards. While there's some hope that Apple will announce a local AI partner (Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance), the overall sentiment appears to be leaning towards the pessimistic side. Adding to this is the consistent negative sentiment expressed in previous rounds by other models, along with a general trend of decreasing confidence. I will give this news more weight than Buffett's confidence since analysts and the market trend may give information that Buffett do not know.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the headline emphasizes Apple's AI efforts, the content reveals concerns. A BofA analyst lowered the price target due to a weak macro environment and slower-than-expected AI adoption.  Reduced iPhone Q2 unit estimates further dampen the near-term outlook. However, the analyst's maintained 'Buy' rating suggests confidence in long-term prospects and strong fundamentals.  The rise of Chinese AI also adds uncertainty to the tech sector.  The previous predictions show a trend toward pessimism, with probabilities consistently favoring a price fall.  Considering these factors \u2013 near-term headwinds, long-term potential, and the prevailing market sentiment reflected in the prior predictions \u2013 I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall in the short term. However, the strong fundamentals and long term positive outlook mitigates this significantly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple.

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, with probabilities often favoring a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of the favorite stocks, with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information, and weighing the predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.

Despite mentioning that Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants, the overarching sentiment of market anxiety and the sell-off in major tech stocks, including Nvidia and Microsoft, pose significant risks. Apple faces a challenging market environment and potential concerns about its AI strategy and guidance. The previous rounds of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by factors such as earnings ESP, Zacks Rank, high P/E ratio, and the bearish outlook of analysts. However, Apple\u2019s strong brand image and diversified business model could still attract investors.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple Inc., emphasizing its strong fundamentals and aggressive capital-return program. However, there are mixed signals regarding recent share sales by Berkshire Hathaway and concerns about Apple's performance, particularly related to its AI strategy and potential guidance cuts. Previous predictions from various models indicated a trend towards caution, with the majority favoring a slight probability of stock price decline due to existing market pressures and analyst concerns. Overall, despite Buffett's confidence, current macroeconomic challenges and analyst sentiment suggest a slightly higher likelihood of a stock price fall in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article indicates a mixed outlook for Apple as they enter their earnings week. While the overall Q4 earnings are expected to be positive for the S&P 500 companies, Apple has been lagging behind the 'Mag 7' and is facing concerns related to its China operations and AI strategy. There are projections of potential guidance cuts by bearish analysts and some downward revisions of EPS estimates. On the brighter side, the company might announce a local AI partnership, potentially with Baidu, Tencent, or ByteDance. Considering previous predictions show decreasing confidence in Apple, combined with the mixed signals from this article, I lean towards a slightly negative outlook. However, Apple's proven business and large following indicate it won't completely fall. I anticipate most negative news is priced in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive aspects include Warren Buffett's continued confidence (though tempered by Berkshire Hathaway's recent share sales), Apple's strong position in the AI sector with Apple Intelligence, and its robust fundamentals (strong profit margins, cash flow).  Negative aspects include a weak macroeconomic environment, slower-than-expected AI adoption, lowered iPhone unit estimates, concerns about China's rapidly advancing AI sector (and the potential impact on Nvidia, a key supplier), and bearish analyst projections of guidance cuts.  The previous predictions show a clear trend toward pessimism, with the probability of a price fall consistently higher than a price rise across multiple rounds and different models. This trend is further influenced by the overall market sentiment toward the tech sector. While Apple's diversification might offer some resilience, the prevailing negative sentiment, and the tangible near-term concerns outweigh the long-term potential in the short term. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of unexpected positive developments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential impact of Apple's upcoming quarterly results on Berkshire Hathaway's stock, given Berkshire's significant holding in Apple. Historical data shows a moderate correlation (0.49) between the two stocks' performances, but past instances indicate that even strong Apple results have led to only modest gains for Berkshire (less than 2%). The article also highlights that Apple's recent AI features (Apple Intelligence) may not have significantly boosted iPhone sales, and there are concerns about the broader tech sector sentiment due to the emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot. The article suggests that Berkshire's valuation is currently not attractive, with no recent buybacks and modest growth projections. Given these factors, the direct impact of Apple's results on its own stock price is uncertain, but the broader context suggests limited upside potential. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook for Apple, with probabilities often favoring a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. as one of the favorite stocks with a decline of 11.3% year-to-date and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). The article also mentions that Apple is not cheap, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.1. Considering this information and weighing the predictions from other models, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. The overall trend and ranking suggest a negative outlook, and the high P/E ratio indicates that the stock may be overvalued. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified business model could still attract investors, which is why the probability of the stock price falling is not extremely high. The previous rounds of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by factors such as earnings ESP, Zacks Rank, high P/E ratio, and the bearish outlook of analysts.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a sell-off in tech stocks as a result of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot emerging as a competitive threat to leading AI companies. Despite mentioning that Apple is less impacted compared to other tech giants, the overarching sentiment of market anxiety and the sell-off in major tech stocks, including Nvidia and Microsoft, pose significant risks. Apple faces a challenging market environment and potential concerns about its AI strategy and guidance. The previous rounds of predictions consistently leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, influenced by factors such as earnings ESP, Zacks Rank, high P/E ratio, and the bearish outlook of analysts. However, Apple\u2019s strong brand image and diversified business model could still attract investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
