A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by positive sentiment from increased iPhone production estimates and better-than-expected demand from China. Furthermore, the implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model create a favorable backdrop for Apple's focus on on-device AI, which may enhance its product offerings and investor confidence. However, concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades could counterbalance this optimism. Given the immediate positive reaction in stock price and the optimistic outlook from JPMorgan, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant sell-off in tech stocks driven by the emergence of a Chinese AI competitor, DeepSeek. DeepSeek's claims of cost-effectiveness and similar performance raise concerns about the valuations of US tech companies and potentially impact demand for high-end chips. While some argue this might benefit hyperscalers in the long-run by decreasing costs, the immediate market reaction is fear and uncertainty, causing a flight to safety and a decline in tech stock prices. Apple's moderate rise can be attributed factors from analyst speculation, and market reactions may be correlated as this new AI technology may provide enhanced features for products such as iPhones. However, overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact, particularly in the short term, on US tech companies directly involved in or reliant upon AI development.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS growth and strong Services segment performance are positive, concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal.  The article highlights a stretched valuation compared to the sector. Although the AI push is a long-term positive, its immediate impact on the Q1 earnings is uncertain.  Considering the overall mixed signals and the bearish Zacks rating, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short-term following the earnings announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The key points include a mixed outlook for Q1 earnings and revenue, with EPS expected to rise by 8.3% but revenue growth slowing to 3.7%. Notably, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which historically correlates with short-term stock price performance. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a -12.8% return over the past month and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. While some segments like Services and Mac show strong growth, others like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative impact on the tech sector due to the introduction of a new AI model by China's DeepSeek and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which adds to the uncertainty. Given the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the app's ban in the U.S. may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the high demand for iPhones with TikTok installed could boost sales and revenue for Apple, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, the ban on TikTok may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall business, and the high prices of these iPhones may not be sustainable. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the U.S. may also impact Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively low due to the limited impact of this news on Apple's overall business.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Warren Buffett and his advisors appear to have the utmost confidence in Berkshire Hathaway's stock, as Buffett has consistently bought back shares over the years. This level of commitment from Buffett could positively influence investor sentiment towards Berkshire Hathaway, driving its stock price upward. However, the news does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) except for the implication that Buffett might be selling off Apple shares for tax purposes.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. There is positive sentiment driven by JPMorgan's upgrade on iPhone production estimates due to stronger demand from China, which led to a significant rise in Apple's stock price. However, concerns remain over competition from new, cost-effective AI models introduced by DeepSeek and the potential impact on high-end tech companies like Apple. Despite a positive short-term gain and improving production outlook, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is tempered by concerns about declining valuations and competition in the AI space. Given the conflicting factors, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rising but a noticeable risk of falling, particularly leading up to the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on a significant threat to US tech companies stemming from the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. This has triggered a market sell-off, particularly impacting AI-related stocks and chipmakers. While Apple might see some short-term gains due to investors rotating out of other tech stocks, the overall sentiment is negative for the sector as a whole. The comparison to 'AI's Sputnik moment' emphasizes the long-term competitive threat. The article highlights negative impacts to comparable companies such as Microsoft seeing losses, the general consensus leans towards a negative impact with investors considering the downside pressure from the new AI competition.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q1 2025 earnings. While the expected EPS growth of 8.26% is positive, projected revenue growth is only in the low-to-mid single digits, and iPhone sales are expected to decline slightly.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  However, concerns remain about competition in China, a delayed Apple Intelligence launch, and a stretched valuation (Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)).  The previous predictions are varied, highlighting the uncertainty.  While the AI push is a long-term positive, its short-term impact is unclear. Considering the mixed signals, the relatively low revenue growth compared to EPS growth, the Zacks Sell rating, and the competitive pressures,  the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term following the earnings announcement.  The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating considerable uncertainty in the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, the company is expected to report an 8.3% increase in quarterly earnings and a 3.7% rise in revenues year over year, with strong growth in segments like Services and Mac. However, there are several negative indicators: a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, underperformance of the stock (-12.8% return vs. S&P 500's +1.1%), and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggesting potential underperformance. Additionally, key segments like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and recent underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news indicates a negative impact on the tech sector due to the introduction of a new AI model by China's DeepSeek and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which adds to the uncertainty. While some predictions suggest a potential rise in stock price based on positive sentiment and long-term growth prospects, the overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact in the short term. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model raises concerns about the valuations of US tech companies, potentially impacting demand for high-end chips and creating a flight to safety. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the app's ban in the U.S. may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price.

On the other hand, the ban on TikTok may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall business, and the high prices of these iPhones may not be sustainable. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the U.S. may also impact Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slight optimism in the earlier rounds but increasing caution and negativity in the later rounds. Given the novelty and temporary nature of the situation, I believe the impact on Apple's stock will be limited and short-term, thus not significantly altering the overall trend.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in a particular stock but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Moreover, the news suggests that Buffett may have sold Apple shares, which introduces mixed signals. Previous predictions suggest a varied mix of optimistic and pessimistic outlooks, influenced by different factors such as earnings reports, competitive pressures, and broader market sentiments. Given the recent underperformance and mixed signals, it is prudent to lean cautiously towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook, balancing the historical success signals while considering recent negative trends.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
