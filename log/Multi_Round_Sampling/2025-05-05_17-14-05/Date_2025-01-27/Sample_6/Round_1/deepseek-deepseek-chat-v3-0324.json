(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Unveiling Apple (AAPL) Q1 Outlook: Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics\nNews Content: The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +1.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Services' reaching $26.18 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by positive sentiment from increased iPhone production estimates and better-than-expected demand from China. Furthermore, the implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model create a favorable backdrop for Apple's focus on on-device AI, which may enhance its product offerings and investor confidence. However, concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades could counterbalance this optimism. Given the immediate positive reaction in stock price and the optimistic outlook from JPMorgan, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant sell-off in tech stocks driven by the emergence of a Chinese AI competitor, DeepSeek. DeepSeek's claims of cost-effectiveness and similar performance raise concerns about the valuations of US tech companies and potentially impact demand for high-end chips. While some argue this might benefit hyperscalers in the long-run by decreasing costs, the immediate market reaction is fear and uncertainty, causing a flight to safety and a decline in tech stock prices. Apple's moderate rise can be attributed factors from analyst speculation, and market reactions may be correlated as this new AI technology may provide enhanced features for products such as iPhones. However, overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact, particularly in the short term, on US tech companies directly involved in or reliant upon AI development.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS growth and strong Services segment performance are positive, concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal.  The article highlights a stretched valuation compared to the sector. Although the AI push is a long-term positive, its immediate impact on the Q1 earnings is uncertain.  Considering the overall mixed signals and the bearish Zacks rating, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short-term following the earnings announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The key points include a mixed outlook for Q1 earnings and revenue, with EPS expected to rise by 8.3% but revenue growth slowing to 3.7%. Notably, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which historically correlates with short-term stock price performance. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a -12.8% return over the past month and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. While some segments like Services and Mac show strong growth, others like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative impact on the tech sector due to the introduction of a new AI model by China's DeepSeek and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which adds to the uncertainty. Given the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the app's ban in the U.S. may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the high demand for iPhones with TikTok installed could boost sales and revenue for Apple, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, the ban on TikTok may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall business, and the high prices of these iPhones may not be sustainable. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the U.S. may also impact Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively low due to the limited impact of this news on Apple's overall business.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Warren Buffett and his advisors appear to have the utmost confidence in Berkshire Hathaway's stock, as Buffett has consistently bought back shares over the years. This level of commitment from Buffett could positively influence investor sentiment towards Berkshire Hathaway, driving its stock price upward. However, the news does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) except for the implication that Buffett might be selling off Apple shares for tax purposes.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
