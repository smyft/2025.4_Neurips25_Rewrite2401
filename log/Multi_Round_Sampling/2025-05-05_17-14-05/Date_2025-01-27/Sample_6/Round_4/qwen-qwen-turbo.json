(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters\nNews Content: When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.\n\nBuffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, he lays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Street and keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.\n\nBut when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple, AmEx, and Bank of America are large holdings -- but none are Buffett's favorite stock\n\nLogic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nTech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nHowever, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. \"AmEx,\" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an \"indefinite\" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.\n\nYet it's been a long time since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.\n\nBut since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased this stock in 24 out of the last 25 quarters\n\nInterestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.\n\nRather, detailed purchasing activity of this \"favorite stock\" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in is shares of his own company.\n\nHowever, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.\n\nEven though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.\n\nAside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.\n\nFor one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.\n\nThe other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock price saw a significant jump of over 3.7%, fueled by positive sentiment from increased iPhone production estimates and better-than-expected demand from China. Furthermore, the implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model create a favorable backdrop for Apple's focus on on-device AI, which may enhance its product offerings and investor confidence. However, concerns about iPhone sales and recent downgrades could counterbalance this optimism. Given the immediate positive reaction in stock price and the optimistic outlook from JPMorgan, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant sell-off in tech stocks driven by the emergence of a Chinese AI competitor, DeepSeek. DeepSeek's claims of cost-effectiveness and similar performance raise concerns about the valuations of US tech companies and potentially impact demand for high-end chips. While some argue this might benefit hyperscalers in the long-run by decreasing costs, the immediate market reaction is fear and uncertainty, causing a flight to safety and a decline in tech stock prices. Apple's moderate rise can be attributed factors from analyst speculation, and market reactions may be correlated as this new AI technology may provide enhanced features for products such as iPhones. However, overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact, particularly in the short term, on US tech companies directly involved in or reliant upon AI development.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS growth and strong Services segment performance are positive, concerns exist regarding a potential decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating is a significant bearish signal.  The article highlights a stretched valuation compared to the sector. Although the AI push is a long-term positive, its immediate impact on the Q1 earnings is uncertain.  Considering the overall mixed signals and the bearish Zacks rating, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short-term following the earnings announcement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The analysis is based on the provided financial news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The key points include a mixed outlook for Q1 earnings and revenue, with EPS expected to rise by 8.3% but revenue growth slowing to 3.7%. Notably, there has been a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, which historically correlates with short-term stock price performance. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a -12.8% return over the past month and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting potential underperformance. While some segments like Services and Mac show strong growth, others like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and underperformance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative impact on the tech sector due to the introduction of a new AI model by China's DeepSeek and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which adds to the uncertainty. Given the overall negative sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty around Apple's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the app's ban in the U.S. may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the high demand for iPhones with TikTok installed could boost sales and revenue for Apple, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, the ban on TikTok may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall business, and the high prices of these iPhones may not be sustainable. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the U.S. may also impact Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively low due to the limited impact of this news on Apple's overall business.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Warren Buffett and his advisors appear to have the utmost confidence in Berkshire Hathaway's stock, as Buffett has consistently bought back shares over the years. This level of commitment from Buffett could positively influence investor sentiment towards Berkshire Hathaway, driving its stock price upward. However, the news does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL) except for the implication that Buffett might be selling off Apple shares for tax purposes.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The recent news surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. There is positive sentiment driven by JPMorgan's upgrade on iPhone production estimates due to stronger demand from China, which led to a significant rise in Apple's stock price. However, concerns remain over competition from new, cost-effective AI models introduced by DeepSeek and the potential impact on high-end tech companies like Apple. Despite a positive short-term gain and improving production outlook, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is tempered by concerns about declining valuations and competition in the AI space. Given the conflicting factors, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rising but a noticeable risk of falling, particularly leading up to the upcoming earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on a significant threat to US tech companies stemming from the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. This has triggered a market sell-off, particularly impacting AI-related stocks and chipmakers. While Apple might see some short-term gains due to investors rotating out of other tech stocks, the overall sentiment is negative for the sector as a whole. The comparison to 'AI's Sputnik moment' emphasizes the long-term competitive threat. The article highlights negative impacts to comparable companies such as Microsoft seeing losses, the general consensus leans towards a negative impact with investors considering the downside pressure from the new AI competition.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple's Q1 2025 earnings. While the expected EPS growth of 8.26% is positive, projected revenue growth is only in the low-to-mid single digits, and iPhone sales are expected to decline slightly.  The Services segment is expected to perform well.  However, concerns remain about competition in China, a delayed Apple Intelligence launch, and a stretched valuation (Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)).  The previous predictions are varied, highlighting the uncertainty.  While the AI push is a long-term positive, its short-term impact is unclear. Considering the mixed signals, the relatively low revenue growth compared to EPS growth, the Zacks Sell rating, and the competitive pressures,  the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term following the earnings announcement.  The previous predictions show a wide range, indicating considerable uncertainty in the market.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, the company is expected to report an 8.3% increase in quarterly earnings and a 3.7% rise in revenues year over year, with strong growth in segments like Services and Mac. However, there are several negative indicators: a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate over the past 30 days, underperformance of the stock (-12.8% return vs. S&P 500's +1.1%), and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggesting potential underperformance. Additionally, key segments like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and recent underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news indicates a negative impact on the tech sector due to the introduction of a new AI model by China's DeepSeek and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which adds to the uncertainty. While some predictions suggest a potential rise in stock price based on positive sentiment and long-term growth prospects, the overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact in the short term. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model raises concerns about the valuations of US tech companies, potentially impacting demand for high-end chips and creating a flight to safety. Given these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the app's ban in the U.S. may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the high demand for iPhones with TikTok installed could boost sales and revenue for Apple, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, the ban on TikTok may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall business, and the high prices of these iPhones may not be sustainable. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future in the U.S. may also impact Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slight optimism in the earlier rounds but increasing caution and negativity in the later rounds. Given the novelty and temporary nature of the situation, I believe the impact on Apple's stock will be limited and short-term, thus not significantly altering the overall trend.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in a particular stock but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Moreover, the news suggests that Buffett may have sold Apple shares, which introduces mixed signals. Previous predictions suggest a varied mix of optimistic and pessimistic outlooks, influenced by different factors such as earnings reports, competitive pressures, and broader market sentiments. Given the recent underperformance and mixed signals, it is prudent to lean cautiously towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook, balancing the historical success signals while considering recent negative trends.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news reflects a complex and mixed scenario for Apple Inc. Recent positive developments, such as JPMorgan's upgrade on iPhone production estimates due to stronger demand from China, contributed to a notable short-term stock price increase. However, the extraordinary emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model presents a significant competitive threat to US tech giants, likely fostering negative sentiment in the tech sector. Previous predictions indicate a wide range of sentiments, with some leaning towards caution due to Apple\u2019s declining valuations and the potential impact of AI competition on market dynamics. As such, while there are reasons for cautious optimism, the prevailing uncertainties suggest a probabilistic tilt toward a price decline in the near term, especially before the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline highlights a significant plunge in US stocks due to concerns over China's AI threat, specifically DeepSeek's chatbot. This triggered a tech sell-off with substantial drops in major tech stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft. While Apple experienced a relatively smaller drop compared to others, the overarching negative sentiment in the tech sector, coupled with fears of increased competition and valuation concerns, raises the probability of a price fall. The overall trend in recent predictions has also shifted towards a more cautious, slightly negative outlook, influenced less by Apple specific news and more by external market factors.. There is a mix sentiment on Apple's valuation, but the Deepseek AI chatbot's impact has spread through Wall Street, pushing stock prices lower.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While expected EPS growth is positive (8.26%), revenue growth is projected to be low-to-mid single digits, and iPhone sales are forecast to decline slightly.  The Services segment is expected to perform well, offsetting some of the weakness in iPhone sales. However, significant headwinds exist:  competition from Chinese vendors in a key market (China), a delayed launch of the crucial Apple Intelligence AI system, and a stretched valuation (reflected in the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)).  The previous predictions show significant divergence, highlighting market uncertainty. While the AI push is a long-term positive, its short-term impact is uncertain, and the negative Zacks rating signals potential near-term underperformance.  Considering the overall mixed signals, the relatively low revenue growth, the delayed AI launch, the Zacks Sell rating, and competitive pressures, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise in the short term following the earnings announcement. The previous rounds' predictions show a trend towards less optimism and more pessimism, which I also incorporate into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

Additionally, key segments like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and recent underperformance. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided financial news indicates a negative impact on the tech sector due to the introduction of a new AI model by China's DeepSeek and concerns around the Federal Reserve's interest rate move. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is set to report earnings this week, which adds to the uncertainty. While some predictions suggest a potential rise in stock price based on positive sentiment and long-term growth prospects, the overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact in the short term. The emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model raises concerns about the valuations of US tech companies, potentially impacting demand for high-end chips and creating a flight to safety. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news about iPhones with TikTok installed selling for high prices on eBay due to the app's ban in the U.S. may have a mixed impact on Apple's stock price. On one hand, the high demand for iPhones with TikTok installed could boost sales and revenue for Apple, potentially leading to a rise in stock price. On the other hand, the ban on TikTok may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's overall business, and the high prices of these iPhones may not be sustainable. Considering the novelty and temporary nature of the situation, the impact on Apple's stock will likely be limited and short-term. Additionally, the overall sentiment from previous predictions indicates a cautious outlook with a slight lean towards negativity due to various factors such as competitive pressures, earnings reports, and market sentiments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Warren Buffett's confidence in a particular stock but does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Moreover, the news suggests that Buffett may have sold Apple shares, which introduces mixed signals. Previous predictions suggest a varied mix of optimistic and pessimistic outlooks, influenced by different factors such as earnings reports, competitive pressures, and broader market sentiments. Given the recent underperformance and mixed signals, it is prudent to lean cautiously towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook, balancing the historical success signals while considering recent negative trends.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there are positive drivers, such as increased iPhone production estimates and short-term gains from market sentiment, the emergence of a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek introduces significant competitive threat and negative sentiment in the broader tech sector. Previous predictions revealed varied opinions, leaning slightly negative amid uncertainties regarding iPhone sales and the company's recent performance. Therefore, despite some optimism surrounding Apple's outlook, the weighted sentiment suggests a greater risk of a stock price decline due to competitive pressures and market dynamics ahead of the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news is dominated by the negative impact of DeepSeek AI on the broader tech sector, causing a significant sell-off. Although Apple's direct exposure to the AI hardware market may be less immediate than companies like Nvidia, the overall negative sentiment creates a risk-off environment that will impact even strong companies. Furthermore, the news highlights concerns about the competitiveness of US tech in the face of lower-cost solutions like DeepSeek, potentially suppressing future growth expectations. The previous predictions consistently trend toward a more cautious outlook on Apple in response to this news. Based on all of this context, I'll predict that the stock has a higher probability of falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the expected EPS growth of 8.26% is positive, the projected revenue growth of only 3.73% is lower than previous quarters and suggests slowing momentum.  The projected decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China and the delayed launch of Apple Intelligence are significant negative factors.  The strong performance of the Services segment is a positive, but it may not be sufficient to offset the weaknesses in other areas. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating adds to the bearish sentiment.  The previous predictions show a trend towards increasing pessimism. While the AI push is a long-term positive, its short-term impact on Q1 earnings is uncertain. Considering the overall mixed signals, the lower-than-expected revenue growth, the delayed AI launch, the bearish Zacks rating, and the competitive pressures, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term following the earnings announcement.  The consensus of the previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. Positive aspects include an expected 8.3% increase in quarterly earnings and a 3.7% rise in revenues year over year, with strong growth in segments like Services and Mac. However, negative indicators include a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate, underperformance of the stock (-12.8% return vs. S&P 500's +1.1%), and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) suggesting potential underperformance. Key segments like iPhone and certain geographic regions show declines or slower growth. The overall sentiment appears cautious, leaning slightly negative due to the EPS revision and recent underperformance.
