A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway's relationship with Apple, emphasizing the moderate correlation between their stock performances. While positive results from Apple could have a slight upward impact on Berkshire's stock, historical data shows that significant moves in Apple's stock do not translate to the same for Berkshire. Moreover, the article suggests a cautious stance on investing in Berkshire right now due to its current valuation and lack of expected growth. Therefore, the probability of stock price movement for Berkshire Hathaway based on Apple's upcoming report is likely low, leaning towards stability or a slight decrease. As a result, the probabilities reflect more caution than optimism for a price rise, and a relatively higher probability of a slight decline based on the sentiment expressed in the report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential threat to the earnings growth of big tech companies, including Apple, due to increased competition in the AI space. The market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek indicates investor sensitivity to this risk. While the article points out that Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow significantly, the emergence of DeepSeek raises concerns about whether these expectations will be met. Given Apple's exposure to the overall tech market sentiment and its dependence on continued growth in its segments, this news presents a negative outlook in the short term. Because the article refers to recent events followed by positive future earnings outlook, the probability of a short term fall is high, followed by a slight chance of rise as investors reconcile positive outlooks with current market movements.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The overall market is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek's AI model and the anticipation of a Fed rate hike, which could negatively affect tech stocks.  However, Apple's earnings report this week is a significant factor. Strong earnings could outweigh the negative market sentiment, while weaker-than-expected results could exacerbate the downward pressure.  The probability estimates are made considering the overall market uncertainty and the importance of Apple's upcoming earnings report, which has a potentially high impact on its stock price.  The probabilities lean slightly towards a price fall given the negative market context, but a significant positive surprise in the earnings could easily change the direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including skepticism about AI being a significant growth driver, declining revenue in China, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and competitive pressures in the AI and tech markets. The analyst's comments suggest that Apple's current valuation may not be justified by its AI prospects, and the lack of immediate catalysts could weigh on investor sentiment. Given these points, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses the temporary ban of TikTok on Apple's App Store and the subsequent surge in demand for iPhones with TikTok still installed. This has led to iPhones being sold for thousands of dollars on eBay. However, this frenzy is likely short-lived and may not have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. The ban's uncertainty and the potential for TikTok to be reinstated or sold could influence investor sentiment, but it's unlikely to be a major driver for Apple's stock price movement. The overall impact on Apple's business is expected to be minimal, as this is a temporary situation and TikTok's availability does not directly affect Apple's core business operations or financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's expansion of AI investments, which is expected to propel ecosystem growth and innovation. According to JPMorgan, Apple is one of the key players in the AI landscape, with a strong focus on AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. The report highlights that while the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest of the market is unsustainable, the strong fundamentals of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple make a catch-down scenario unlikely. However, the report also cautions that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. Considering Apple's investments in AI and its position in the AI value chain, the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. But, given the already high valuation of Apple's stock, the potential for upside may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses Berkshire Hathaway and its current valuation and performance metrics. While it mentions Apple's earnings report on Jan. 30, which may have an indirect effect on Berkshire Hathaway due to its significant holding in Apple, the article concludes that rushed investments in Berkshire Hathaway should not be encouraged based on Apple's report. The article suggests Berkshire's current valuation and analyst expectations do not justify immediate action.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Strong earnings could mitigate the negative market influence, while weak results would likely exacerbate the downward pressure.
